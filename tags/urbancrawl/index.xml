      <description>After my last post on Flexible Reaction Rolls, I found myself thinking about how to build Character Classes that fit with the schemey, urban style of play I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for with Fellhold. The trouble for me until now was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of ways to get that stuff without impinging on the Old School playstyle I enjoy. What cracked it for me was turning the Reaction Roll into a mechanic with more knobs to play with.</description>

      <description>Reaction rolls are one of my very favorite set of rules. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and help me to come up with more interesting stuff than I might on my own. I use them as a general purpose social sub-system, though not nearly to the same extent as Courtney Campbell in his excellent On the Non-Player Character. Instead, I use them more as an oracle when I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how the NPCs would react.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here.

One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?</description>

I was pretty skeptical of myself when I set out to write this section. Initially, I just planned on including some guidance that basically said &amp;ldquo;go read the section of Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents about conspiracies and make something up for your city. But with all of the other generators I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing, it just seemed to go against the ethos I&amp;rsquo;ve been following of &amp;ldquo;make tools that people can use or ignore as they like&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Vendors and Merchants of Fellhold</title>

Today we have another of the specialist NPC types in Fellhold, like the Sages previously presented. Also like the sages, a big, big inspiration for them was Noism/David McGrogan&amp;rsquo;s treatment of fences here. The goal with merchants is twofold: first off, I want to make the people who sell PCs the stuff they frequently buy potentially interesting, and secondly to be contacts in the world of business, providing their own jobs and intrigue and social connections with a different flavor than sages, patrons, or fences.</description>

Ever since I decided that the rebooted Fellhold is a massive dungeon-city/city-dungeon, I have been giving a lot of thought to Urbancrawling rules. This series of posts at the Alexandrian covered the topic in a lot of detail, and helped me to organize my thinking, including the core idea of having a &amp;ldquo;default action&amp;rdquo;. And Paolo&amp;rsquo;s discussion of his game Gangs &amp;amp; Bullshit introduced the idea of structuring how you &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;zoom out&amp;rdquo;, and when I smashed the two ideas together, I felt a tremendous &amp;ldquo;A-ha!</description>

One of the major &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo; of my Fellhold reboot (if that&amp;rsquo;s not too grand a word) is the idea of place being important. Factions have turf, demons have loci they are tied to, and some powers only work in certain places. A frequent hole in the sense of place in D&amp;amp;D games is a place for the characters to live - hence all the murderhoboery. I contend that one contributing reason for this is that most cost of living or lifestyle rules suck and are boring.</description>

Today we continue with some more Fellhold Reboot content - in this case a couple of random encounter tables. There&amp;rsquo;s reference to some district and faction encounters - those are still under developed. The first here is a list of situations you could find your contacts in when you go to find them or bump into them on the street. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a series of rules I&amp;rsquo;m putting together to try to enhance the role contacts play for players in the game.</description>

      <title>Places of Interest in Fellhold</title>

As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a few previous posts, I am in the process of pretty extensively overhauling my homebrew setting Fellhold. As a part of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been drafting some tables to help with stocking the place, which is an enormous, largely ruined city where the dungeon and the urban run together pretty fluidly. Below are the tables for &amp;ldquo;Places of Interest&amp;rdquo;, which are the handful of places within a district likely worth looking into in more detail, also usable to detail out something that catches the players&amp;rsquo; attention in play.</description>
