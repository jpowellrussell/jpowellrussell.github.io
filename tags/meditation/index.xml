      <description>Today I want to talk about something a little different - my first experience with a float tank session. Also known as flotation tanks or sensory deprivation tanks, I first heard about them via Tim Ferriss, and he discusses them in his latest book Tools of Titans, but apparently Joe Rogan is also a huge proponent of them, and has some great stuff to say about using them in a regular practice.</description>
