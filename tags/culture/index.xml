      <description>Stories are essential for building and maintaining strong cultures. They help everyone learn the group&amp;rsquo;s way of doing things, create belonging, and make meaning out of what they do every day. In fact, you can define culture as an ongoing story that a group tells together.
Cultures share a way of thinking about things. All of us shape our thinking with mental models, which help us to see blind spots, work better, and understand what we learn.</description>
