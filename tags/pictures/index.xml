[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, seeÂ here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

      <description>As has become something of a tradition, I am posting a bunch of pictures on Friday in a mad dash to keep up with my weekdaily posting. The second part of the Vornheiming Middenheim epilogue is under construction, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get a lot done on that on an airplane ride Sunday evening, so I hope to have it to post on Monday or Tuesday. In the meantime, here are some cool pictures I found for my Fellhold campaign from cghub.</description>
