      <description>I made a thing that makes monsters. I&amp;rsquo;m terribly pleased with it right now, but let me know what you think. If the embed below is giving you weird formatting (on a phone or tablet, say), or if you just want to mess with it, check out the sheet here.
I used Brendan&amp;rsquo;s excellent methodology to build it in Google Sheets. Every time you refresh this page, you should get a new result.</description>

      <title>OSR Classes: The Mastermind and the Rook</title>

      <description>After my last post on Flexible Reaction Rolls, I found myself thinking about how to build Character Classes that fit with the schemey, urban style of play I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for with Fellhold. The trouble for me until now was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of ways to get that stuff without impinging on the Old School playstyle I enjoy. What cracked it for me was turning the Reaction Roll into a mechanic with more knobs to play with.</description>

      <description>Reaction rolls are one of my very favorite set of rules. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and help me to come up with more interesting stuff than I might on my own. I use them as a general purpose social sub-system, though not nearly to the same extent as Courtney Campbell in his excellent On the Non-Player Character. Instead, I use them more as an oracle when I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how the NPCs would react.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I find coming up with equipment lists a huge pain in the ass. Coming up with starting equipment packages? Even harder. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I just use one of the perfectly serviceable equipment lists already out there? Because I definitely buy into the thought that equipment lists are a great way to convey implicit setting and approaches to the game. So I bit the bullet and cranked the below out.</description>

      <title>The Soul Economy in Fellhold</title>

      <description>So, back when I first started rebooting my home campaign setting from a Tentpole Megadungeon generic D&amp;amp;D world that owed a lot to Dwimmermount and into something a little funkier, one of the ideas I hit upon was that the economy would be based on souls. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what that meant, but it seemed cool, so I ran with it. Well, after lots of reading and thinking and coming up with other parts of the world, it finally clicked together into something that makes some (warped, D&amp;amp;D, in-game) sense.</description>

Okay, so this one isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard, since you could pretty much just run Mononoke as a D&amp;amp;D game, but I was watching Mononoke and taking notes on gods/spirits/demons anyway, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and slap this bad boy together. Enjoy!

      <description>I am very excited to announce that the Fellhold project now has an official artist! The talented and gracious Eric Koch has signed on as the better half of this DIY monstrosity. You can check out his stuff here at his tumblr. So far he has been a joy to work with, and while I plan on greedily hogging all of his RPG-related art time for the next year or so, if after that you&amp;rsquo;re in need of pictures, I highly recommend him.</description>

[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection.

One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?</description>

I was pretty skeptical of myself when I set out to write this section. Initially, I just planned on including some guidance that basically said &amp;ldquo;go read the section of Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents about conspiracies and make something up for your city. But with all of the other generators I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing, it just seemed to go against the ethos I&amp;rsquo;ve been following of &amp;ldquo;make tools that people can use or ignore as they like&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Today we have another of the specialist NPC types in Fellhold, like the Sages previously presented. Also like the sages, a big, big inspiration for them was Noism/David McGrogan&amp;rsquo;s treatment of fences here. The goal with merchants is twofold: first off, I want to make the people who sell PCs the stuff they frequently buy potentially interesting, and secondly to be contacts in the world of business, providing their own jobs and intrigue and social connections with a different flavor than sages, patrons, or fences.</description>

Noisms/David McGrogan has done some really fantastic stuff with generating player characters&amp;rsquo; social circles in more urban games - most notably in Yoon-Suin, and in development for his new setting/game &amp;ldquo;There is Therefore a Strange Land&amp;rdquo;, as shown in this post. In that post, he provides a table for generating a fence (not a physical barrier around a yard, but a person who buys dubiously acquired merchandise), and I have found it tremendously inspirational for Fellhold.</description>

Ever since I decided that the rebooted Fellhold is a massive dungeon-city/city-dungeon, I have been giving a lot of thought to Urbancrawling rules. This series of posts at the Alexandrian covered the topic in a lot of detail, and helped me to organize my thinking, including the core idea of having a &amp;ldquo;default action&amp;rdquo;. And Paolo&amp;rsquo;s discussion of his game Gangs &amp;amp; Bullshit introduced the idea of structuring how you &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;zoom out&amp;rdquo;, and when I smashed the two ideas together, I felt a tremendous &amp;ldquo;A-ha!</description>

One of the major &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo; of my Fellhold reboot (if that&amp;rsquo;s not too grand a word) is the idea of place being important. Factions have turf, demons have loci they are tied to, and some powers only work in certain places. A frequent hole in the sense of place in D&amp;amp;D games is a place for the characters to live - hence all the murderhoboery. I contend that one contributing reason for this is that most cost of living or lifestyle rules suck and are boring.</description>

Today we continue with some more Fellhold Reboot content - in this case a couple of random encounter tables. There&amp;rsquo;s reference to some district and faction encounters - those are still under developed. The first here is a list of situations you could find your contacts in when you go to find them or bump into them on the street. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a series of rules I&amp;rsquo;m putting together to try to enhance the role contacts play for players in the game.</description>

As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a few previous posts, I am in the process of pretty extensively overhauling my homebrew setting Fellhold. As a part of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been drafting some tables to help with stocking the place, which is an enormous, largely ruined city where the dungeon and the urban run together pretty fluidly. Below are the tables for &amp;ldquo;Places of Interest&amp;rdquo;, which are the handful of places within a district likely worth looking into in more detail, also usable to detail out something that catches the players&amp;rsquo; attention in play.</description>

      <description>So, I like to get into procedures, techniques, and tactics in a lot of aspects of my life: the nitty gritty, detailed ways to exactly do a particular thing. For some gaming related examples, check out these previous posts: creating d100 tables from media, and various procedures in the megadungeon. What I want to talk about today is how to get the most out of mining a book, comic, picture, or whatever for gameable stuff.</description>

      <description>http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/8680/Seattle_Underground.jpg So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on rebooting my homebrew campaign setting for a while now, just letting thoughts percolate, challenging myself to get creative, and I think something clicked when I went on the Seattle Underground tour.
As a sneak peak, here&amp;rsquo;s the new Fellhold in 25 words or less:
Endless forest, Germanic dwarves, falling lich empire, Pacific Northwest, pioneers, crapsack, city, demons, witches, brick, dynamite, warrior lodges, feuds, ratmen, wendigos, tides, totem poles, gods’ bones.</description>

      <description>So, a couple of adventures that were add-ons to the Better than Any Man kickstarter have been published in the last few months, and I picked them both up today: The Pale Lady by +Zzarchov Kowolski and The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man by Andre Novoa. Since both are rather brief, and since I got both at the same time, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double feature review, especially since there&amp;rsquo;s some nice compare and contrast items.</description>

I totally forgot to give a shout out to +Mateo Diaz Torres and the Pernicious Albion setting, which is just awful, since I&amp;rsquo;m helping with layout on its upcoming publication.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

      <description>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ57k8grq_Q/VReWYLyKuZI/AAAAAAAAEHg/koeIn53rmSM/s1600/The_Emperor_Revenant.png ## Introduction To kick off my Heresies Without Number game with my home group, I was casting about for an adventure I could run with fairly minimal adaptation. I ended up settling on a D&amp;amp;D adventure that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to run since I got it last year: Forgive Us from Lamentations of the Flame Princess*. *
As I went through, I discovered it took surprisingly little modification to get it ready for 40k, but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up my book for future use as-is, I decided to type up my 40k specific notes.</description>

Introduction I began down this path working on my Heresies Without Number kitbash of Stars Without Number and Dark Heresy. I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: Darkest Dungeon and Arnold K. The sanity rules are pretty much a reskin of this post by Arnold.</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been slow the last couple of months, and I apologize. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely lucky to be working on a layout project that should turn out to be something pretty cool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to advertise it loudly until it&amp;rsquo;s closer to completion. The downside to this very exciting news is that my own personal hobby projects, like the Adventure Companies one, is going on the back-burner (still thinking about it and working on it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a priority of my gaming hobby time).</description>

Okay, so in my game of Crapsack Goblins where most of the players are still running around in loin cloths, I realized it would be helpful to have some help in thinking up weird and hilarious clothing options for the goblins they encounter. Thus, the following table was born. It is intended so that you can either roll 1d20 and get a reasonably coherent (for a goblin) outfit, or you can roll for as many of the columns as you like.</description>

So, for this review, I want to take a page out of Gus&amp;rsquo;s book and provide a general overview, the stuff I liked, the stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and most importantly, what changes I would make to the adventure. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect it will be anywhere near as interesting or creative as Gus&amp;rsquo;s efforts, but hopefully somebody will find something useful here. Oh, and this will be totally spoilery, so please don&amp;rsquo;t continue if you&amp;rsquo;re hoping to play this.</description>

These are rules. These are commentary for the blog. ** ** So, a few responses to previous posts have made me realize that not everyone finding these posts realizes they are part of a series. That link will take you to all the posts in this project so far, and will continue to take you to any more that come up. By way of a general introduction, I should point out that the structure of these rules owe a lot to Fantasy Flight’s Rogue Trader game.</description>

Once again this text is rules. This text is commentary for the blog. ** ** To avoid confusion with the companies sent out from colonies on expeditions, the organization which owns the colony and employs all of its inhabitants is referred to as a corporation. The default assumption is that it literally is a joint stock corporation formed by wealthy investors who elect a board of directors who hire officers to make them profits, but the rules will work just as well for representing a department of government, a thieves guild, or any other sort of organization that might dispatch adventurers to far off places in search of wealth.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

Colonies (All money is in LotFP’s “Silver Standard”) Current version of rules text looks like this. Commentary for this blog entry looks like this. ** ** Resources General Description Food (~5sp) - one unit feeds one person for one week Building Materials (~5sp) - Wood, stone, et cetera used to construct buildings Treasure (~40sp) - Gold, loot, art, spices, furs, other trade goods - sent home as profit ** ** The way I’ve worked out the resource values is a crazy scaffolding of assumptions and handwaving.</description>

Commentary So last night I was able to run for the first time the game concept I outlined here. Since writing that, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the set up a little bit and I was able to subject my regular weekly group to the game rather than trying it out on strangers first. The summary version is that it was hilarious and fun and the combination of setting and rules created exactly the kind of mad-cap goblin shennanigans I was hoping for!</description>

After I posted that table of contents last time, I did an analysis of what sections depended on other sections and realized that the main core that would affect how just about everything else played out was statting up the &amp;ldquo;adventure company&amp;rdquo; itself. I think that this, plus the colony rules, will be the main contributions of this project (assuming I do a half decent job, anyway).</description>

Following up my general thrust post on the adventuring company setting/game thing I’m working on, here’s the working table of contents for what I’m planning to write, with some initial indication of organization. I have a few questions about this that would be helpful to get answers for: ** ** 1. Does this look like something cool? Would anyone besides me get any use out of this? 2. Has too much of this already been done too well to be worth repeating?</description>

So, as inspired by some of the random encounters over at Playing D&amp;amp;D with Pornstars, here is a random encounter generator for patrols from the more militant sort of opponents. Specifically, in Fellhold, I&amp;rsquo;m using this for random encounters with hobgoblin and human gang member patrols. My party still tore through one of these with a well-timed sleep spell and judicious application of axes. Now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to decide whether to charm or murder the sleeping hobgoblins and where to go from there, so I&amp;rsquo;d say mission = success.</description>

So, I&amp;rsquo;ve just started a new job, and I just saw someone else on Google+ talking about a new job, and the characters in Fellhold just replaced all of the hirelings who were killed in a horrific exploding wizard accident. All of this has left me wanting to do something quick about hirelings adjusting to the adventuring lifestyle: in other words, &amp;ldquo;onboarding&amp;rdquo; new hirelings. And so I present &amp;ldquo;The First Time a Hireling is Asked to Confront the Unknown, Bizarre, or Completely Screwed Up&amp;rdquo;:</description>

So, a combination of a Google+ post about Dwarves being like the Sumerians (that unfortunately I cannot find to properly attribute) and Ben L.&amp;lsquo;s post on Textual Corruptions has me thinking about dwarves in Fellhold. Specifically, it has come up a lot that the Dwarf character&amp;rsquo;s loosely defined familiarity with Dwarven culture has given him all sorts of benefits in the part of the dungeon built by the dwarves. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of a great way to get around that.</description>

So, work stuff combined with the snowy death weather that has visited itself upon my visit to Atlanta has resulted in me not getting the relationship map stuff finished up. So instead I want to put up a quick post expanding a little more on some thoughts raised by yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Fashion post regarding the reaction roll mechanic.
Now, point one: Courtney Campbell has done a lot of awesome stuff with the reaction roll and modifying it based on history with individuals and groups in his &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;quot;, so first and foremost, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in expanding that mechanic, go there.</description>

So, this post is inspired by some in-game events and then some discussion on Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s recent post about fashion in D&amp;amp;D. Basically, the party in Fellhold got invited a feast at an earl&amp;rsquo;s great hall in the city. They asked about fancy clothes, I looked at LotFP and was like &amp;ldquo;sure, 20 silver&amp;rdquo;, and they were like &amp;ldquo;but it says it can go even higher if we want.&amp;rdquo; And so I ended up with a silly ad hoc system for tracking the fabulousness (or fabulosity, if you prefer) of the clothing for some hardbitten adventurers.</description>

      <description>As has become something of a tradition, I am posting a bunch of pictures on Friday in a mad dash to keep up with my weekdaily posting. The second part of the Vornheiming Middenheim epilogue is under construction, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get a lot done on that on an airplane ride Sunday evening, so I hope to have it to post on Monday or Tuesday. In the meantime, here are some cool pictures I found for my Fellhold campaign from cghub.</description>

So, in writing the Middenheim series, I really came to love the use of rumors as a way to convey both setting information as well as adventure hooks. Thanks to +Brendan S and +Pearce Shea , I had some further discussion of rumors and why I like them and what they do, and I wanted to expand those thoughts some here.
The first and perhaps most obvious virtue of rumors is their dubious veracity.</description>

      <description>So, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this Middenheim supplement thing, I&amp;rsquo;ve been skimming some of the &amp;ldquo;Enemy Within&amp;rdquo; adventures, especially &amp;ldquo;Power Behind the Throne&amp;rdquo;. Then I read &amp;ldquo;Small But Vicious Dog&amp;rdquo; and immediately wanted to play it, which got me thinking about the problem I&amp;rsquo;ve had with the Old World setting for RPGs: where do you get started, and what do you do? Fortunately, SBVD has some great advice here, but it&amp;rsquo;s gotten me thinking about the published WFRP adventures I&amp;rsquo;ve read and/or skimmed, and I wanted to talk about that some.</description>

Dungeon Dozen Fan Index
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, folks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting back to Middenheim soon (possibly even later today, depending on what I can get done). But I wanted to take a minute to talk about a mini-project I&amp;rsquo;m maybe one third to half way through: the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index. First off, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dungeon Dozen, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. Jason Sholtis creates totally amazing D12 tables of just about anything you can imagine: dungeon building, encounters, monster abilities, character backgrounds, and more.</description>

      <description>So, reading some blog entries and some Google+ posts has given me an idea for a game that I&amp;rsquo;d like to run, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if/when I ever will. Basically, I want to combine the &amp;ldquo;dung ages&amp;rdquo; crapsack vibe from +Thomas Fitzgerald &amp;lsquo;s Middenmurk posts, the super-grungy goblin city-crawling of +Arnold K. &amp;lsquo;s Escape from Yoblin Town, and the &amp;ldquo;everything is scavenged, everything is precious&amp;rdquo; vibe of +Jack Mack &amp;lsquo;s Neanderthal post, along with a lot of encumbrance and equipment wear stuff that Arnold K, Jack Mack, +Logan Knight and others have been talking about a lot recently.</description>

Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to post a few pictures and a link to the Pinterest board I&amp;rsquo;ve created for the Fellhold campaign. Most of the board comes from Thomas Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s excellent Middenmurk tumblr, but I&amp;rsquo;ve supplemented it with stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve found recently and over the years.</description>

[edit: it&amp;rsquo;s Sunday, not Saturday] * *Reading Arnold K&amp;rsquo;s totally sweet post about Wizards and Witches inspired me to try to come up with a way to think up bizarre taboos for wizards and monastic types on the fly.

      <description>So, I really really like LotFP&amp;rsquo;s summon spell (not exactly an original sentiment, there). I like it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;enough rope to hang yourself&amp;rdquo; approach that makes a potentially super powerful spell available at level 1 with the caveat that it&amp;rsquo;s highly random and unstable. And for LotFP&amp;rsquo;s weird fantasy milieu, I even like the bizarre otherworldly results. But for Fellhold, I wanted something a little more thematically coherent, so I reworked it to work for my game.</description>

      <description>In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post I gave a brief outline of factional goings on off-screen using Courtney Campbell&amp;rsquo;s rules from &amp;ldquo;On the NPC&amp;rdquo; as a starting point. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out one way to handle combat between factions, though it&amp;rsquo;s abstract enough that you could use it to handle non-combat rivalry as well. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to touch briefly on an idea about taking and losing territory. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post was about getting an idea of what the factions think of each other so that when players run into them, there will be rivalries and alliances to learn and manipulate.</description>

      <description>So, I wanted to try a little experiment. I got &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;rdquo; back when it first came out, skimmed it, read some reviews, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t read it fully until the last few days. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about using it for regular encounters and the like, but I was struck with the idea to use it to do off-screen faction interactions, like in a mega-dungeon. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do the experiment here (I&amp;rsquo;m also trying out the &amp;ldquo;After the Break&amp;rdquo; feature, which I just learned how to use).</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m going through the spell lists to try to make them more appropriate for the shape that wizards are starting to take in Fellhold. My good friend (Yllgrad&amp;rsquo;s player, if you follow the play report posts at all) sent me some spell ideas (Troll Form, Create Familiar, Orb of Many Colors, Volsungr&amp;rsquo;s Anvil, and Summon Spiders are all based on his stuff), and that got me started working on the spell descriptions.</description>

      <description>Because I ought to be working on the spell list for the updated magic rules so that the new wizard character can actually do his thing, so of course I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about megadungeons instead.
 Derinkuyu: Real Dungeon. Google it!
So, we&amp;rsquo;ve got node-based megadungeon design and we&amp;rsquo;ve got various dungeon map generators, dating back to the 1st Edition DMG. I think these two extremes of granularity (very little and very much respectively) are missing a sweet spot in a methodology for designing a megadungeon.</description>

      <description>So, after being shamed by the accurate description at Charles Akin&amp;rsquo;s Great Blog Roll Call of my posting habits (ridiculously infrequent), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put up a quick post with some thoughts from a recent Google+ conversation, and to work on my concision to boot.
I solicited some ideas about how much damage higher-level fighters should do in older types of D&amp;amp;D. In OD&amp;amp;D and the various flavors of Basic-derived D&amp;amp;D, fighters don&amp;rsquo;t really get a bunch of attacks or damage bonuses beyond whatever they start with (okay, except against 1HD foes).</description>
