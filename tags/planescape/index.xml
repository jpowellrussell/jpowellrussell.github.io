      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, seeÂ here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]</description>
