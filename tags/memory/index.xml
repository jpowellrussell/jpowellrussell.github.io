      <description>Stories are not only a great way to communicate information, they are also a powerful tool for learning it. People remember information better when it comes in the form of a story.

Besides making your process more fun, there are three main ways stories can help you learn: forcing careful thought, assisting recall, and providing deliberate practice.</description>
