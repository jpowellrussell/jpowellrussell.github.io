      <description>KHS Series Part 1: Bringing In New Knowledge Opening This is all about input By definition, to learn, you have to find stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t already know. This post is all about that step. Clearly that&amp;rsquo;s not all there is to learning, but it lays the groundwork for the other steps we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about in this series. For me, the main thing to keep in mind for input is &amp;ldquo;Garbage In, Garbage Out&amp;rdquo; - if you don&amp;rsquo;t start with worthwhile stuff, you won&amp;rsquo;t learn deep, meaningful things.</description>
