      <title>Removing Support from Zak Smith</title>

      <description>[UPDATE February 14th, 2019: Zak has issued a statement responding here. I am not convinced to change my position below, but it introduces some doubt. I may have further thoughts as more information comes out, but I encourage you to read and evaluate it for yourself. UPDATE February 16th 2019: I reworded the bit about what it would take to change my stance to include adequate evidence that the claims were false, rather than only saying evidence of growth on Zak&amp;rsquo;s part would do it.</description>

      <description>I made a thing that makes monsters. I&amp;rsquo;m terribly pleased with it right now, but let me know what you think. If the embed below is giving you weird formatting (on a phone or tablet, say), or if you just want to mess with it, check out the sheet here.
I used Brendan&amp;rsquo;s excellent methodology to build it in Google Sheets. Every time you refresh this page, you should get a new result.</description>

      <description>After my last post on Flexible Reaction Rolls, I found myself thinking about how to build Character Classes that fit with the schemey, urban style of play I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for with Fellhold. The trouble for me until now was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of ways to get that stuff without impinging on the Old School playstyle I enjoy. What cracked it for me was turning the Reaction Roll into a mechanic with more knobs to play with.</description>

      <description>Reaction rolls are one of my very favorite set of rules. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and help me to come up with more interesting stuff than I might on my own. I use them as a general purpose social sub-system, though not nearly to the same extent as Courtney Campbell in his excellent On the Non-Player Character. Instead, I use them more as an oracle when I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how the NPCs would react.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I find coming up with equipment lists a huge pain in the ass. Coming up with starting equipment packages? Even harder. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I just use one of the perfectly serviceable equipment lists already out there? Because I definitely buy into the thought that equipment lists are a great way to convey implicit setting and approaches to the game. So I bit the bullet and cranked the below out.</description>

      <title>D100 D&amp;Dables from Princess Mononoke</title>

Okay, so this one isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard, since you could pretty much just run Mononoke as a D&amp;amp;D game, but I was watching Mononoke and taking notes on gods/spirits/demons anyway, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and slap this bad boy together. Enjoy!

      <description>I am very excited to announce that the Fellhold project now has an official artist! The talented and gracious Eric Koch has signed on as the better half of this DIY monstrosity. You can check out his stuff here at his tumblr. So far he has been a joy to work with, and while I plan on greedily hogging all of his RPG-related art time for the next year or so, if after that you&amp;rsquo;re in need of pictures, I highly recommend him.</description>

[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here.

One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?</description>

I was pretty skeptical of myself when I set out to write this section. Initially, I just planned on including some guidance that basically said &amp;ldquo;go read the section of Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents about conspiracies and make something up for your city. But with all of the other generators I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing, it just seemed to go against the ethos I&amp;rsquo;ve been following of &amp;ldquo;make tools that people can use or ignore as they like&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Vendors and Merchants of Fellhold</title>

Today we have another of the specialist NPC types in Fellhold, like the Sages previously presented. Also like the sages, a big, big inspiration for them was Noism/David McGrogan&amp;rsquo;s treatment of fences here. The goal with merchants is twofold: first off, I want to make the people who sell PCs the stuff they frequently buy potentially interesting, and secondly to be contacts in the world of business, providing their own jobs and intrigue and social connections with a different flavor than sages, patrons, or fences.</description>

Noisms/David McGrogan has done some really fantastic stuff with generating player characters&amp;rsquo; social circles in more urban games - most notably in Yoon-Suin, and in development for his new setting/game &amp;ldquo;There is Therefore a Strange Land&amp;rdquo;, as shown in this post. In that post, he provides a table for generating a fence (not a physical barrier around a yard, but a person who buys dubiously acquired merchandise), and I have found it tremendously inspirational for Fellhold.</description>

Ever since I decided that the rebooted Fellhold is a massive dungeon-city/city-dungeon, I have been giving a lot of thought to Urbancrawling rules. This series of posts at the Alexandrian covered the topic in a lot of detail, and helped me to organize my thinking, including the core idea of having a &amp;ldquo;default action&amp;rdquo;. And Paolo&amp;rsquo;s discussion of his game Gangs &amp;amp; Bullshit introduced the idea of structuring how you &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;zoom out&amp;rdquo;, and when I smashed the two ideas together, I felt a tremendous &amp;ldquo;A-ha!</description>

One of the major &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo; of my Fellhold reboot (if that&amp;rsquo;s not too grand a word) is the idea of place being important. Factions have turf, demons have loci they are tied to, and some powers only work in certain places. A frequent hole in the sense of place in D&amp;amp;D games is a place for the characters to live - hence all the murderhoboery. I contend that one contributing reason for this is that most cost of living or lifestyle rules suck and are boring.</description>

Today we continue with some more Fellhold Reboot content - in this case a couple of random encounter tables. There&amp;rsquo;s reference to some district and faction encounters - those are still under developed. The first here is a list of situations you could find your contacts in when you go to find them or bump into them on the street. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a series of rules I&amp;rsquo;m putting together to try to enhance the role contacts play for players in the game.</description>

As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a few previous posts, I am in the process of pretty extensively overhauling my homebrew setting Fellhold. As a part of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been drafting some tables to help with stocking the place, which is an enormous, largely ruined city where the dungeon and the urban run together pretty fluidly. Below are the tables for &amp;ldquo;Places of Interest&amp;rdquo;, which are the handful of places within a district likely worth looking into in more detail, also usable to detail out something that catches the players&amp;rsquo; attention in play.</description>

      <description>So, I like to get into procedures, techniques, and tactics in a lot of aspects of my life: the nitty gritty, detailed ways to exactly do a particular thing. For some gaming related examples, check out these previous posts: creating d100 tables from media, and various procedures in the megadungeon. What I want to talk about today is how to get the most out of mining a book, comic, picture, or whatever for gameable stuff.</description>

      <description>http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/8680/Seattle_Underground.jpg So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on rebooting my homebrew campaign setting for a while now, just letting thoughts percolate, challenging myself to get creative, and I think something clicked when I went on the Seattle Underground tour.
As a sneak peak, here&amp;rsquo;s the new Fellhold in 25 words or less:
Endless forest, Germanic dwarves, falling lich empire, Pacific Northwest, pioneers, crapsack, city, demons, witches, brick, dynamite, warrior lodges, feuds, ratmen, wendigos, tides, totem poles, gods’ bones.</description>

      <title>&#34;Review of The Pale Lady&#34; and &#34;The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man&#34;</title>

      <description>So, a couple of adventures that were add-ons to the Better than Any Man kickstarter have been published in the last few months, and I picked them both up today: The Pale Lady by +Zzarchov Kowolski and The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man by Andre Novoa. Since both are rather brief, and since I got both at the same time, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double feature review, especially since there&amp;rsquo;s some nice compare and contrast items.</description>

      <title>Equipment Tables for Stars Without Number, Dark Heresy, and Warband</title>

One of the things I want to develop for Heresies Without Number is a set of equipment packages by career. So, in other words, if you choose &amp;ldquo;Arbitrator&amp;rdquo; for a career, you get a stack of equipment to go with it that makes sense. These will hopefully be coming soon, but as a step in my process of figuring out what gear to include, I realized I wanted to be able to compare and manipulate my source equipment lists - Stars Without Number, Dark Heresy, and Warband!</description>

      <description>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ57k8grq_Q/VReWYLyKuZI/AAAAAAAAEHg/koeIn53rmSM/s1600/The_Emperor_Revenant.png ## Introduction To kick off my Heresies Without Number game with my home group, I was casting about for an adventure I could run with fairly minimal adaptation. I ended up settling on a D&amp;amp;D adventure that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to run since I got it last year: Forgive Us from Lamentations of the Flame Princess*. *
As I went through, I discovered it took surprisingly little modification to get it ready for 40k, but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up my book for future use as-is, I decided to type up my 40k specific notes.</description>

Introduction Taken together, these rules provide for running NPC factions and for players obtaining what they need from them. The faction rules are largely based on the Factions system in the main Stars Without Number rulebook, with a hearty injection from Gus L’s HMS Apollyon faction rules. The faction characteristics range from negative to positive numbers, with zero as average, to work with the acquisition rules, and the faction action and assets rules have been simplified to suit my own GM style.</description>

Introduction I began down this path working on my Heresies Without Number kitbash of Stars Without Number and Dark Heresy. I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: Darkest Dungeon and Arnold K. The sanity rules are pretty much a reskin of this post by Arnold.</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been slow the last couple of months, and I apologize. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely lucky to be working on a layout project that should turn out to be something pretty cool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to advertise it loudly until it&amp;rsquo;s closer to completion. The downside to this very exciting news is that my own personal hobby projects, like the Adventure Companies one, is going on the back-burner (still thinking about it and working on it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a priority of my gaming hobby time).</description>

Okay, so in my game of Crapsack Goblins where most of the players are still running around in loin cloths, I realized it would be helpful to have some help in thinking up weird and hilarious clothing options for the goblins they encounter. Thus, the following table was born. It is intended so that you can either roll 1d20 and get a reasonably coherent (for a goblin) outfit, or you can roll for as many of the columns as you like.</description>

That link will take you to all the posts in this project so far, and will continue to take you to any more that come up. By way of a general introduction, I should point out that the structure of these rules owe a lot to Fantasy Flight’s Rogue Trader game.</description>

Once again this text is rules. This text is commentary for the blog. ** ** To avoid confusion with the companies sent out from colonies on expeditions, the organization which owns the colony and employs all of its inhabitants is referred to as a corporation. The default assumption is that it literally is a joint stock corporation formed by wealthy investors who elect a board of directors who hire officers to make them profits, but the rules will work just as well for representing a department of government, a thieves guild, or any other sort of organization that might dispatch adventurers to far off places in search of wealth.</description>

Colonies (All money is in LotFP’s “Silver Standard”) Current version of rules text looks like this. Commentary for this blog entry looks like this. ** ** Resources General Description Food (~5sp) - one unit feeds one person for one week Building Materials (~5sp) - Wood, stone, et cetera used to construct buildings Treasure (~40sp) - Gold, loot, art, spices, furs, other trade goods - sent home as profit ** ** The way I’ve worked out the resource values is a crazy scaffolding of assumptions and handwaving.</description>

Commentary So last night I was able to run for the first time the game concept I outlined here. Since writing that, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the set up a little bit and I was able to subject my regular weekly group to the game rather than trying it out on strangers first. The summary version is that it was hilarious and fun and the combination of setting and rules created exactly the kind of mad-cap goblin shennanigans I was hoping for!</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet on this project, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to noodle with it in the background. After I posted that table of contents last time, I did an analysis of what sections depended on other sections and realized that the main core that would affect how just about everything else played out was statting up the &amp;ldquo;adventure company&amp;rdquo; itself. I think that this, plus the colony rules, will be the main contributions of this project (assuming I do a half decent job, anyway).</description>

So, as inspired by some of the random encounters over at Playing D&amp;amp;D with Pornstars, here is a random encounter generator for patrols from the more militant sort of opponents. Specifically, in Fellhold, I&amp;rsquo;m using this for random encounters with hobgoblin and human gang member patrols. My party still tore through one of these with a well-timed sleep spell and judicious application of axes. Now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to decide whether to charm or murder the sleeping hobgoblins and where to go from there, so I&amp;rsquo;d say mission = success.</description>

So, I&amp;rsquo;ve just started a new job, and I just saw someone else on Google+ talking about a new job, and the characters in Fellhold just replaced all of the hirelings who were killed in a horrific exploding wizard accident. All of this has left me wanting to do something quick about hirelings adjusting to the adventuring lifestyle: in other words, &amp;ldquo;onboarding&amp;rdquo; new hirelings. And so I present &amp;ldquo;The First Time a Hireling is Asked to Confront the Unknown, Bizarre, or Completely Screwed Up&amp;rdquo;:</description>

So, a combination of a Google+ post about Dwarves being like the Sumerians (that unfortunately I cannot find to properly attribute) and Ben L.&amp;lsquo;s post on Textual Corruptions has me thinking about dwarves in Fellhold. Specifically, it has come up a lot that the Dwarf character&amp;rsquo;s loosely defined familiarity with Dwarven culture has given him all sorts of benefits in the part of the dungeon built by the dwarves. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of a great way to get around that.</description>

So, work stuff combined with the snowy death weather that has visited itself upon my visit to Atlanta has resulted in me not getting the relationship map stuff finished up. So instead I want to put up a quick post expanding a little more on some thoughts raised by yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Fashion post regarding the reaction roll mechanic.
Now, point one: Courtney Campbell has done a lot of awesome stuff with the reaction roll and modifying it based on history with individuals and groups in his &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;quot;, so first and foremost, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in expanding that mechanic, go there.</description>

So, this post is inspired by some in-game events and then some discussion on Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s recent post about fashion in D&amp;amp;D. Basically, the party in Fellhold got invited a feast at an earl&amp;rsquo;s great hall in the city. They asked about fancy clothes, I looked at LotFP and was like &amp;ldquo;sure, 20 silver&amp;rdquo;, and they were like &amp;ldquo;but it says it can go even higher if we want.&amp;rdquo; And so I ended up with a silly ad hoc system for tracking the fabulousness (or fabulosity, if you prefer) of the clothing for some hardbitten adventurers.</description>

      <title>Rumor Has It</title>

So, in writing the Middenheim series, I really came to love the use of rumors as a way to convey both setting information as well as adventure hooks. Thanks to +Brendan S and +Pearce Shea , I had some further discussion of rumors and why I like them and what they do, and I wanted to expand those thoughts some here.
The first and perhaps most obvious virtue of rumors is their dubious veracity.</description>

[Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the Dungeon Dozen Adventure Contest . Deadline is Friday!] * *Okay, so not really a mystery so much as an adventure, but I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for situational use of song lyrics. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through using some of the Middenheim tools to make an adventure. As a proof of concept, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to run through this &amp;ldquo;by the numbers&amp;rdquo; as much as possible, and limit my editorial changes.</description>

      <description>So, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this Middenheim supplement thing, I&amp;rsquo;ve been skimming some of the &amp;ldquo;Enemy Within&amp;rdquo; adventures, especially &amp;ldquo;Power Behind the Throne&amp;rdquo;. Then I read &amp;ldquo;Small But Vicious Dog&amp;rdquo; and immediately wanted to play it, which got me thinking about the problem I&amp;rsquo;ve had with the Old World setting for RPGs: where do you get started, and what do you do? Fortunately, SBVD has some great advice here, but it&amp;rsquo;s gotten me thinking about the published WFRP adventures I&amp;rsquo;ve read and/or skimmed, and I wanted to talk about that some.</description>

Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve caught up to the present day on the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index, I&amp;rsquo;m all fired up about how awesome all of these d12 tables are. Each one was my new favorite as I read it. I got to thinking about how there&amp;rsquo;s practically a whole game there (aided and abetted in this notion by Patrick Stuart, who really concretized that idea). Certainly I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot there in very small packages.</description>

      <description>. . . for now. I have completed getting the fan index up to date and categorized as far as I am capable of right now. In case you aren&amp;rsquo;t happy with how I&amp;rsquo;ve gone about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve alphabetized all of the links here, but otherwise left them unformatted. I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that I&amp;rsquo;ll update that non-organized list as often as I update the index here on the blog, but it should be one hell of a head start for anyone who wants to go about putting the links together differently.</description>

Super brief post tonight due both to the fact that I had a lot of stuff to do around the house today as well as the fact that I want to try an even leaner format for the district write ups. I&amp;rsquo;ve just given the names of the chief locations in Ulricsmund and put anything interesting in the rumors. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of The Dungeon Dozen (as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post and the new fan index might indicate), and even though I was already using the D12 because I like it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good size for rumors per district, I am now even more convinced of the amount of good stuff you can put just into a D12 table with a good theme.</description>

Dungeon Dozen Fan Index
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, folks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting back to Middenheim soon (possibly even later today, depending on what I can get done). But I wanted to take a minute to talk about a mini-project I&amp;rsquo;m maybe one third to half way through: the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index. First off, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dungeon Dozen, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. Jason Sholtis creates totally amazing D12 tables of just about anything you can imagine: dungeon building, encounters, monster abilities, character backgrounds, and more.</description>

      <description>So, reading some blog entries and some Google+ posts has given me an idea for a game that I&amp;rsquo;d like to run, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if/when I ever will. Basically, I want to combine the &amp;ldquo;dung ages&amp;rdquo; crapsack vibe from +Thomas Fitzgerald &amp;lsquo;s Middenmurk posts, the super-grungy goblin city-crawling of +Arnold K. &amp;lsquo;s Escape from Yoblin Town, and the &amp;ldquo;everything is scavenged, everything is precious&amp;rdquo; vibe of +Jack Mack &amp;lsquo;s Neanderthal post, along with a lot of encumbrance and equipment wear stuff that Arnold K, Jack Mack, +Logan Knight and others have been talking about a lot recently.</description>

Most of the board comes from Thomas Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s excellent Middenmurk tumblr, but I&amp;rsquo;ve supplemented it with stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve found recently and over the years.</description>

      <description>So, I really really like LotFP&amp;rsquo;s summon spell (not exactly an original sentiment, there). I like it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;enough rope to hang yourself&amp;rdquo; approach that makes a potentially super powerful spell available at level 1 with the caveat that it&amp;rsquo;s highly random and unstable. And for LotFP&amp;rsquo;s weird fantasy milieu, I even like the bizarre otherworldly results. But for Fellhold, I wanted something a little more thematically coherent, so I reworked it to work for my game.</description>

      <description>In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post I gave a brief outline of factional goings on off-screen using Courtney Campbell&amp;rsquo;s rules from &amp;ldquo;On the NPC&amp;rdquo; as a starting point. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out one way to handle combat between factions, though it&amp;rsquo;s abstract enough that you could use it to handle non-combat rivalry as well. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to touch briefly on an idea about taking and losing territory. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post was about getting an idea of what the factions think of each other so that when players run into them, there will be rivalries and alliances to learn and manipulate.</description>

      <description>So, I wanted to try a little experiment. I got &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;rdquo; back when it first came out, skimmed it, read some reviews, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t read it fully until the last few days. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about using it for regular encounters and the like, but I was struck with the idea to use it to do off-screen faction interactions, like in a mega-dungeon. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do the experiment here (I&amp;rsquo;m also trying out the &amp;ldquo;After the Break&amp;rdquo; feature, which I just learned how to use).</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m going through the spell lists to try to make them more appropriate for the shape that wizards are starting to take in Fellhold. My good friend (Yllgrad&amp;rsquo;s player, if you follow the play report posts at all) sent me some spell ideas (Troll Form, Create Familiar, Orb of Many Colors, Volsungr&amp;rsquo;s Anvil, and Summon Spiders are all based on his stuff), and that got me started working on the spell descriptions.</description>

      <description>Because I ought to be working on the spell list for the updated magic rules so that the new wizard character can actually do his thing, so of course I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about megadungeons instead.
 Derinkuyu: Real Dungeon. Google it!
So, we&amp;rsquo;ve got node-based megadungeon design and we&amp;rsquo;ve got various dungeon map generators, dating back to the 1st Edition DMG. I think these two extremes of granularity (very little and very much respectively) are missing a sweet spot in a methodology for designing a megadungeon.</description>

      <description>Last night we wrapped up “Season 1” of Fellhold. Not Season 1 in some pre-planned plot arc sense, heavens no! Rather, starting next week we’re switching to the new game I mentioned last time, and it just so happened that a lot of shit hit the fan this session and we ended at a good cliffhanger. Serendipitous! 
So, shit and fan hitting: we returned to Gurgu smashing pillars in his summoning area, most of the party hiding, and Bryni leading Bjergmund and a few priests and initiates down to see the “miracle” of Gurgu summoned, with the hopes of gently guiding them to the worship of Volsungr or some other proper god (but they figured Volsungr would be the best fit).</description>

      <description>Last night’s session was fairly short on game play, but what did happen seemed to go pretty well. The reason gameplay was short was because we spent the first hour or so discussing what game to add to the rotation. Fellhold will continue, but two weeks from today it will go on a hiatus while we play a new game for a while. The thought is to keep anybody (myself included) from getting burned out or losing interest, and to enjoy other roleplaying games, cos why have just one?</description>

The table that opens the book displays its wargame roots to me. Monsters are presented here as a list, rather than as encyclopedia type entries that you see in the Monster Manual and onwards.</description>

      <description>Research, research, research. This session was pretty much entirely the players using the library in the Fyrberg temple to try to find out more about the history of Gurgu, Gurguism, and the complex in the mountain. It dragged a little, as everyone was researching different stuff, and I had to narrate results of their researches to each person individually. Also, describing what you’ve read in ancient texts isn’t always the most interesting experience.</description>

      <description>So, after my enthusiastic blurb the other day, I figured “Better than Any Man” warranted a full review after I finished reading it last night. So, here that review is.

First off, for those that might not know, what is “Better than Any Man” (hereafter referred to as BTAM)? BTAM is a meaty adventure/mini-sandbox written by James Raggi for his Lamentations of the Flame Princess Adventures line and specifically for “Free RPG Day 2013”.</description>

By way of participating in the RPG Blog Carnival for May, I thought I’d jump in with talking about campaigns I’d like to run, and man, are there a lot. Unfortunately, probably a lot more than I’ll ever get to, but that’s just the way of things. So, to impose some structure on my excessive campaign desires, I am going to give an example for each suggested facet of the topic from the introductory post to this Month’s carnival.</description>

      <description>This will be a fairly bare bones recap, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been busier than anticipated this week.
Yllgrad managed to escape the temple, and he even did so without murdering the initiates that he held hostage. Of course, shortly after leaving, they told the high priest what had happened, and the priesthood of Gurgu decided to pursue the crazed dwarf. When the characters who had undergone the initiation into the belief of Gurgu reached the shrine again, they found the priests and initiates looking agitated.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to come add magic runes to the Fellhold campaign for a while now, to get that delicious Viking flavor. I contemplated a cool combinatory system with very modular runes, kinda inspired by sygalldry in Patrick Rothfuss&amp;rsquo;s Kingkiller Chronicle books, but I decided that a) that would be a whole lot of work, and b) it would clash with the overall Vancian magical flavor of D&amp;amp;D the campaign has mostly relied on.</description>

      <description>Last night’s session saw us with about half the usual group due to a confluence of work and finals for three of the players. So, that left us with Caleb, Earn, and Yllgrad in the big city of Mickleheim. Their players were pretty pumped about getting stuff sold and getting to the Volcano, but a) I wanted to flesh out Mickleheim some, b) I wanted to give some of the Vornheim city kit rules and others that I’ve compiled a test drive, and c) I needed some more time to properly prep the volcano adventure, so we ended up zooming in on their errands in the city.</description>

      <description>So, in my ongoing Fellhold campaign, we’ve been using Akratic Wizardry’s rather good “weapon damage by class” rule as a compromise between “all weapons do d6” and “all weapons have their own unique damage”. I think if we weren’t already 6 months into using these rules, I’d probably tweak some of the damage a little bit, and maybe recategorize a few weapons (having short bows, long bows, and crossbows all do “medium weapon” damage, and treating hired swords as level 1 fighting men means that players have access to cheap and plentiful d8 damage – I gotta remember to play up the hirelings as people more).</description>

      <description>So, I’m reading through the excellent analysis of skills in D&amp;amp;D over at Hack &amp;amp; Slash. It touches on what the functions of a resolution mechanic are at all, and especially digs into what 3.x/Pathfinder style skills bring to D&amp;amp;D (and don’t). Considering some of my recent forays away from a pure lack of skill systems at all (using the “Good at” and “Bad at” cues, considering the use of roll under stat checks more often, et cetera), this is striking me as very useful analysis.</description>

      <description>So, for some blog fodder, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to take on the rather ambitious project of going through every version of D&amp;amp;D and comment on the rules. To keep myself sane, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sticking to core books only. I&amp;rsquo;m up in the air on OD&amp;amp;D if it will include the supplements or only the the original three LBB&amp;rsquo;s. The idea is to hit up White Box, Holmes, Moldvay, Mentzer, Rules Cyclopedia, AD&amp;amp;D 1E, AD&amp;amp;D 2E, D&amp;amp;D 3/3.</description>

[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first official Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Appreciation day! Considering Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Whitebox is the ruleset we&amp;rsquo;re using for the Fellhold campaign, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d like to jump in on this. I&amp;rsquo;ve expounded earlier why we went with Whitebox, but basically I found the simplicity attractive as a foundation to add house rules to, rather than trying to cut out pieces of other versions. As play has gone on, it has both taught me to value and enjoy the lack of some rules but also it has pointed out exactly how other rules came to be by experiencing the desire to have them in game.</description>

      <description>Grasping, Avaricious PCs - the best kind
So, long time no recap. As mentioned in my little apology for non-blogging/calling myself to action post, I’m going to completely change up my style for recaps. The whole ‘pulp adventure narrator’ tone was dumb, and I was dumb, but now I’m better, and I’m going to actually talk about player decisions and my decisions and how the session went down and so forth.</description>

      <description>After fleeing from the seemingly endless hordes of large and aggressive trollkin, our adventurers spiked a door behind them and listened with baited breath. Not hearing any sounds of further pursuit, they decided against fleeing blindly, and continued to explore and map carefully. After discovering a secret door and defeating a hideous ooze that dissolved a few weapons, they secured a small clutch of gems, spiked another two doors behind them and decided to rest inside the dungeon.</description>

      <description>We left off with our adventurers deep within the Ashfell, and as we joined them this week, they continued to explore . They returned to the relief mural depiction of the founding of Fellhold and followed the carvings around a large hall, reading a story of dwarves comes to Ashfell, delving into the mountain, and ending with a scene of trade, craft, and fellowship between dwarves and men. Having satisfied themselves that this mural did not contain any further clues about how to proceed, they set off to continue down a wide passageway leading from the imposing statue of a sorceror.</description>

      <description>Our brave adventurers consolidated after cutting down wave after wave of goblin fighters, and decided that the best course of action was to camp outside of the goblin lair they had extensively mapped out. Spending the night in quiet, they proceeded to thoroughly map out every nook and cranny of the goblin delving, and then turned their eyes to the previously explored excavated stairs deeper into the mountain. Following these stairs down, they found a brief encounter with vicious giant rats, a long since abandoned market place, many empty store rooms, and a painful but ultimately unremarkable needle trap.</description>

      <description>Howdy folks. The bulk of this post will be the first actual rules I have written for Fellhold coming out of my reading &amp;ldquo;An Echo, Resounding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dungeon World&amp;rdquo;. I was initially afraid I would simply be using pieces from each with no original material whatsoever, but in the process of figuring out what I really wanted to do, I ended up coming up with something more different than I expected, though the influences are obvious.</description>

      <description>So, for this post I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bit of a departure from the campaign and domain play rules that I&amp;rsquo;ve been kitbashing from Dungeon World and An Echo, Resounding. This is mostly because it&amp;rsquo;s been awhile, and I&amp;rsquo;m having to reconstruct all the stuff I had figured out from what are now opaque notes, and instead of figuring all that out tonight, I went instead for a simpler problem and decided to tackle some planning/layout issues, and then to address equipment tags.</description>

      <description>Our intrepid adventurers, after having destroyed a wolf pack, venture through a secret door into hewn underground passages. Joined this time by Yllgrad and Earn and their cohorts (though still not by Blum) the strengthened party takes a few moments to regroup and take advantage of magical healing before venturing into the underground passages. Finding no sign of the goblins they heard exclaim earlier, they push into to the passages and find a room full of rubble with stairs leading steeply downward.</description>

      <description>Due to various obligations in Silverdelf, Yllgrad, Blum, and Earn remained behind, but along with their hirelings and henchmen, Bryni, Caleb, and Varian set off to explore the heretofore unknown eastern path up the spur to Fellhold. They found that the path petered out in a heavily wooded and gently sloping portion of mountain, with crags and boulders suggesting caves. On further exploration, they found a large cave opening, and an initial scan of the cave revealed a heavy bed of pine needles as well as the grisly remains of creatures large and small, accompanied by a horrible smell.</description>

      <description>After last week&amp;rsquo;s harrowing encounter with arm-hungry statues and pit traps, our daring band of adventurers decided it was time to attend to some matters outside of Fellhold&amp;rsquo;s dark halls. Acca, the hireling who lost his arm, survived his grievous injury, and his family was so grateful for the pension his employer offered him that his son Weorc took service in his place. The party set out on a quiet trip to Mickleheim where they once again strengthened their ties to Clan Dagaeca through the steward Cnud, selling them the splendid necklace of fire opals lifted from Earn the bandit chief and discovering that an exotic beast brought in alive for the midwinter festival would make a fine offering to Hrokr, fine enough that a bounty might be offered.</description>

      <description>Our intrepid band of adventurers finished up their business in Mickleheim, recruiting even more hirelings for renewed expeditions. They returned to Silverdelf without incident and discovered that the captured bandits had been sent off to whatever rough justice awaited them in Mickleheim along with the rescued shipment of whiskey. They also caught wind of an armed group buying supplies and setting off in the direction of Fellhold, but for what purpose?</description>

      <description>Last night, our intrepid band set out on the road to Mickleheim. The first two days of the three day journey passed quietly, but on the third day just after sun up they were set upon by a pack of vicious wolves! Though the only serious injury was to one of Earn&amp;rsquo;s retainers, who was viciously mauled, Earn leapt to his aid and stemmed the bleeding. After the players dispatched one of the wolves, the rest turned tail and ran, losing three more to parting blows and crossbow quarrels.</description>

      <description>Though the title of this post shortchanges the role An Echo, Resounding is playing in my development of the referee rules in my campaign, I figured it was best to stay consistent.
As an example of the role AER is playing, though I&amp;rsquo;m working my way up to the domain rules, rather than down, I am broadly using the categories and concepts from AER&amp;rsquo;s domain play, so that most of the framework for reconciling Dungeon World style GMing tools with the AER domain play should already be there.</description>

      <description>As the party is about to venture forth to Mickleheim, I&amp;rsquo;ve started giving some thought to wilderness/sandbox adventure, which I&amp;rsquo;ve intended from the start to be a facet of the Fellhold campaign. I cheated a little bit up front by asking my players to do me the courtesy of agreeing that their characters had come together with the intent to explore Fellhold, at least initially, and we&amp;rsquo;d go from there. This let me devote my initial focus to having mapped and stocked dungeon locations (as it turns out, far more than I&amp;rsquo;ve needed so far - before play, I overestimated the speed with which the party would explore).</description>

      <description>So, I wanted to separate these thoughts from the recap post, as I intend to keep those almost entirely descriptive of the fiction that works out in the game, rather than the rules and inter-player interactions, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see what works!
After accepting a player&amp;rsquo;s more reasonable interpretation of how Sleep affected a group with mixed hit dice, I was faced with the situation where the party got the drop on a lone, as yet unarmed, surprised 3rd level fighting man with a boat load of hit points (here&amp;rsquo;s me realizing some of the dangers of incorporating unmodified AD&amp;amp;D module encounters into my OD&amp;amp;D game).</description>

      <description>Last night proved to be one of the most successful outings of our brave adventurers yet. Once again venturing under the mountain and into Fellhold, the judicious question of &amp;ldquo;just how many people does the spell Sleep affect?&amp;rdquo; proved to be the defining moment of the session. Finding the remaining bandits at their midday meal, the magic user Blum cast Sleep on the unsuspecting bandits, and immediately placed all but their leader into a magical slumber.</description>

      <description>So, I was inspired by Mr. Maliszewski&amp;rsquo;s post over at Grognardia about homebrew campaign settings to talk a little bit about what&amp;rsquo;s been established regarding Fellhold so far. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a whole lot, because I&amp;rsquo;m trying really hard not to indulge my world building bug and detail out a hugely elaborate setting before things occur in play. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to fix a firm aesthetic in my mind, so that as questions/situations come up in play, I can incorporate recent events and player actions, but still maintain an editorial voice.</description>

      <description>So, the title of this post is more for the sake of continuity than for accuracy. You see, as my referee rule hacking has continued, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using not just Dungeon World, but also An Echo, Resounding and to a lesser extent the Red Tide Campaign Sourcebook. The sandbox material in Red Tide is, as mentioned before, quite excellent, but a good deal of it is superseded by what is included in *An Echo, Resounding.</description>

      <description>After leaving last session with our explorers holding a bandit sergeant hostage, we rejoined the action this evening. A brief parley established that the bandit leader, Gren, didn&amp;rsquo;t value the contributions of his sergeant Dag, and some quick bargaining brought Dag over to the side of the adventurers. They managed to flee, trigger the pressure plate trap to drop a net, and then picked up the net and threw it onto the advancing bandits.</description>

      <description>Let me tell you a little story about the path that led to my starting up an Old School D&amp;amp;D Campaign. While having far too much time on my hands courtesy of the United States Government, I stumbled onto the indie RPG scene online. Amongst other things, I discovered Vincent Baker&amp;rsquo;s games and blog, and started reading and being inspired by both. One post that didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly register at the time, but has since stuck with me was I &amp;lt;3 the OSR, and especially comment number 8.</description>

      <description>In tonight&amp;rsquo;s expedition, our daring adventurers took their first steps into the dank underground of Fellhold. After some accurate mapping and cleverly avoiding a pressure plate trap, the party got the drop on a group of bandits going through their loot. They failed to take full advantage of the surprise and entered into a grinding battle with them. With only the bandits&amp;rsquo; leader and one bandit still standing, a group of bandit reinforcements was spotted about to join the fray, and in a last ditch desperate effort, our adventurers managed to subdue the leader and hope to use his life to parley a way out of this dangerous situation.</description>

      <description>So, as mentioned in my previous post, I think that the GMing rules from Dungeon World/AW are those which can most profitably be ported into an Old School D&amp;amp;D game (Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry WhiteBox in my case). With that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by going through the Dungeon World Agendas, Principles and Moves, as well as the Always Say guidelines, and discuss/tweak to the &amp;lsquo;Old School&amp;rsquo; refing style I am using in my game.</description>

So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the ever-excellent Kevin Crawford&amp;rsquo;s An Echo, Resounding, as well as Sage LaTorra&amp;rsquo;s totally sweet Dungeon World, switching back and forth between the two of them, and I think there&amp;rsquo;s something really powerful to be made between them.</description>

      <description>So, all of my recent posts have been about the Old School Renaissance, and my old school D&amp;amp;D game. If you look to the posts that started this blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that I was quite enamored of indie RPGs and forge theory and the like. At first glance this seems like something of a flip-flop, but it was actually from the indie &amp;ldquo;scene&amp;rdquo; that I discovered the OSR and became fired up to run a D&amp;amp;D game.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to embrace in preparing my Old School campaign has been what Mr. Maliszewski over at Grognardia refers to as &amp;ldquo;The Oracular Power of Dice&amp;rdquo;. I also got the name for my blog from a post by Ben Robbins at Ars Ludi on a similar topic. Basically, the idea is to accept what the dice give you and then craft your plans around them, rather than to have a master plan and only accept results that fit with that plan.</description>

      <title>A Note about Rules</title>

      <description>So, one of the things I took to heart while reading through James Malieszewski&amp;rsquo;s Dwimmermount campaign over at Grognardia was the notion that it is easier to start with sparse rules and then add more subsystems than it is to cut back an existing bigger system. I originally intended to go real-hard core old school and use the original three Little Brown Books as the rules, and add from there. Alas, during character generation I found myself not comfortable enough with them to quickly and efficiently use them as in-game reference material.</description>

      <title>Fellhold Session 1</title>

      <description>So, our brave expedition&amp;rsquo;s first venture up the mountain led to a ruined outpost guarding a gate into the underworld. Blum and Varian were unable to make it on this first expedition, but Yllgrad, Caleb, Bryni, and Earn set their sights on adventure and followed the path out of Silverdelf up the spur of the mountain. While exploring the ruined outpost, Earn and Caleb ventured into a ruined tower and were set upon by a giant spider!</description>

      <description>So, we had to put off our first game session until next week due to a number of scheduling difficulties, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably good, as I will be far more prepared this way. I&amp;rsquo;m having a grand old time swiping stuff from modules and supplements new and old, gleefully combing OD&amp;amp;D, S&amp;amp;W, AD&amp;amp;D 1E, LL, and whatever else comes in handy, while checking facts about ecology online. I haven&amp;rsquo;t designed a dungeon in about 15 years, and back then I was completely focused on providing just the right challenge that players would have a tough time of it, but would win, and they were all &amp;ldquo;lair&amp;rdquo; type dungeons, very much of the &amp;ldquo;something bad is outside of our village, please go deal with it!</description>

      <title>A Wild Campaign Appears!</title>

      <description>Last night saw the character generation session for my new old school campaign, Fellhold. Fellhold is a dungeon built into the living rock of Ashfell made up of ancient dwarven ruins, later additions by a foul cabal of sorcerors and their minions, and who knows what else that has burrowed its way in. The general feel is Germanic swords and sorcery (think if Robert E. Howard wrote Beowulf. Or, you know, the Frost Giant&amp;rsquo;s Daughter works too).</description>

      <title>The Old School is So Cool</title>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Grognardia over the last few days, specifically the posts related to the &amp;ldquo;Dwimmermount&amp;rdquo; Campaign, and it has hit me like a ridiculously specific polearm to the forehead. I had brushed up against the &amp;ldquo;Old School Revolution&amp;rdquo; before, and found some things to like there conceptually, but this series of posts is what really hammered home the ethos and the virtues thereof to me. James Maliszewski&amp;rsquo;s aim was to perform the gaming equivalent of historical re-enactment.</description>
