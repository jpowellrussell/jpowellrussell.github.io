      <title>Money &amp; Equipment in Fellhold</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I find coming up with equipment lists a huge pain in the ass. Coming up with starting equipment packages? Even harder. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I just use one of the perfectly serviceable equipment lists already out there? Because I definitely buy into the thought that equipment lists are a great way to convey implicit setting and approaches to the game. So I bit the bullet and cranked the below out.</description>

[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?</description>

I was pretty skeptical of myself when I set out to write this section. Initially, I just planned on including some guidance that basically said &amp;ldquo;go read the section of Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents about conspiracies and make something up for your city. But with all of the other generators I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing, it just seemed to go against the ethos I&amp;rsquo;ve been following of &amp;ldquo;make tools that people can use or ignore as they like&amp;rdquo;.</description>

These are rules. These are commentary for the blog. ** ** So, a few responses to previous posts have made me realize that not everyone finding these posts realizes they are part of a series. That link will take you to all the posts in this project so far, and will continue to take you to any more that come up. By way of a general introduction, I should point out that the structure of these rules owe a lot to Fantasy Flight’s Rogue Trader game.</description>

Once again this text is rules. This text is commentary for the blog. ** ** To avoid confusion with the companies sent out from colonies on expeditions, the organization which owns the colony and employs all of its inhabitants is referred to as a corporation. The default assumption is that it literally is a joint stock corporation formed by wealthy investors who elect a board of directors who hire officers to make them profits, but the rules will work just as well for representing a department of government, a thieves guild, or any other sort of organization that might dispatch adventurers to far off places in search of wealth.</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet on this project, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to noodle with it in the background. After I posted that table of contents last time, I did an analysis of what sections depended on other sections and realized that the main core that would affect how just about everything else played out was statting up the &amp;ldquo;adventure company&amp;rdquo; itself. I think that this, plus the colony rules, will be the main contributions of this project (assuming I do a half decent job, anyway).</description>

Following up my general thrust post on the adventuring company setting/game thing I’m working on, here’s the working table of contents for what I’m planning to write, with some initial indication of organization. I have a few questions about this that would be helpful to get answers for: ** ** 1. Does this look like something cool? Would anyone besides me get any use out of this? 2. Has too much of this already been done too well to be worth repeating?</description>

So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten Middenheim out the door and received a gratifyingly positive reaction, I&amp;rsquo;ve started thinking about another project idea I had a while back. It was spurred by a blog post I read somewhere (maybe Monsters &amp;amp; Manuals or Hack &amp;amp; Slash?) that talked about the lack of quality OSR innovation in the Campaign Setting arena. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that&amp;rsquo;s still the case, but that thought mixed with some other ideas resulted in the outlines of a thing I want to make.</description>

[Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the Dungeon Dozen Adventure Contest . Deadline is Friday!] * *Okay, so not really a mystery so much as an adventure, but I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for situational use of song lyrics. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through using some of the Middenheim tools to make an adventure. As a proof of concept, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to run through this &amp;ldquo;by the numbers&amp;rdquo; as much as possible, and limit my editorial changes.</description>

Super brief post tonight due both to the fact that I had a lot of stuff to do around the house today as well as the fact that I want to try an even leaner format for the district write ups. I&amp;rsquo;ve just given the names of the chief locations in Ulricsmund and put anything interesting in the rumors. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of The Dungeon Dozen (as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post and the new fan index might indicate), and even though I was already using the D12 because I like it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good size for rumors per district, I am now even more convinced of the amount of good stuff you can put just into a D12 table with a good theme.</description>

Dungeon Dozen Fan Index
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, folks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting back to Middenheim soon (possibly even later today, depending on what I can get done). But I wanted to take a minute to talk about a mini-project I&amp;rsquo;m maybe one third to half way through: the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index. First off, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dungeon Dozen, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. Jason Sholtis creates totally amazing D12 tables of just about anything you can imagine: dungeon building, encounters, monster abilities, character backgrounds, and more.</description>

      <description>Because I ought to be working on the spell list for the updated magic rules so that the new wizard character can actually do his thing, so of course I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about megadungeons instead.
 Derinkuyu: Real Dungeon. Google it!
So, we&amp;rsquo;ve got node-based megadungeon design and we&amp;rsquo;ve got various dungeon map generators, dating back to the 1st Edition DMG. I think these two extremes of granularity (very little and very much respectively) are missing a sweet spot in a methodology for designing a megadungeon.</description>

      <description>So, as I come to the last of the original Little Brown Books, I have to give a bit of background. When I was getting into D&amp;amp;D as an impatient and overconfident adolescent, I initially gave the DMG something of a pass. It was actually the last of the core rulebooks I bought, and if I remember correctly, I ran my first campaign for quite a while without it. I basically figured I knew what was up, and the Player’s Handbook had “the real rules” (a.</description>

      <description>Monsters and Treasures  Okay, so I’ve been writing other stuff for awhile now, and I’ve been neglectful of this little series of naked hubris. So back to it with Monsters and Treasure, Volume 2 of OD&amp;amp;D.
The table that opens the book displays its wargame roots to me. Monsters are presented here as a list, rather than as encyclopedia type entries that you see in the Monster Manual and onwards.</description>

      <description>So, for some blog fodder, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to take on the rather ambitious project of going through every version of D&amp;amp;D and comment on the rules. To keep myself sane, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sticking to core books only. I&amp;rsquo;m up in the air on OD&amp;amp;D if it will include the supplements or only the the original three LBB&amp;rsquo;s. The idea is to hit up White Box, Holmes, Moldvay, Mentzer, Rules Cyclopedia, AD&amp;amp;D 1E, AD&amp;amp;D 2E, D&amp;amp;D 3/3.</description>

      <description>Okay, so, despite the continuing blog silence, I have been thinking very hard about The Book of Threes for the past couple weeks, and doing lots of &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; (in other words, reading RPGs that I&amp;rsquo;d love to get to play, and actually getting some gaming in for once!).
I can tell you right now that the rules as they currently exist are not long for this world. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not true.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how much having a real, face-to-face conversation can do for a design. Despite my lack of discernible activity here on the bloog, the gears they are a-churnin, I&amp;rsquo;m doing thinking and reading and what not that are all informing where I&amp;rsquo;m going.
But! To keep this from being a totally content free &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t go away!&amp;rdquo; sort of post, here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak preview of what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about right now.</description>

      <guid>/gaming/2010-08-18-book-of-threes-best-interests/</guid>
      <description>So, I had a brainwave on how to make &amp;ldquo;Best Interests&amp;rdquo; have a little more teeth (and only after writing it down did I realize it&amp;rsquo;s a solution pretty close to the Burning Wheel system I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting around to reading).
Not only will it give the best interests more mechanical weight, it will (hopefully) increase the tension of choosing between differing interests. Here&amp;rsquo;s my thought: you&amp;rsquo;ve got three best interests (individual, family, and clan) and three resources.</description>

      <description>Okay, sorry this was a bit later than forecasted, but I wanted to collect some thoughts from the first playtest of &amp;ldquo;The Book of Threes&amp;rdquo; done on Google Wave.
First off, it taught me a lot about Google Wave, and while I think it&amp;rsquo;s far superior to a standard forum for RPGs, it still has some shortcomings compared to &amp;lsquo;the real thing&amp;rsquo; of sitting at a table with your friends and talking it out in person.</description>

      <guid>/gaming/2010-06-10-shootin-stuff/</guid>
      <description>So, the first topic I&amp;rsquo;d like to address here with regard to my skirmish rules is of central importance to a modern/sci-fi wargame: shooting stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start out a little theoretical and then move into some practicalities as they relate to those theories.
So, the way I see it, in a skirmish wargame, shooting has two main intentions: to control movement and to remove enemy fighters. The second is fairly obvious, but there are some implications to it I want to discuss, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start with &amp;ldquo;controlling movement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So, as previously mentioned, I got excited about making a Ninja Burger + InSpectres hack, and after noodling around with it, discovered it didn&amp;rsquo;t take much to do at all!
So here it is.
Let me know what you think (this is as yet unplaytested, but considering it comes from two games that work fine and are playtested, I assume it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. I may make changes once I get the chance to play it some).</description>

      <description>So, a recent trend I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about at the cool kid forums is a sort of game where you say &amp;ldquo;need book X to play&amp;rdquo;. Basically people put out more or less detailed conversion notes for using one set of rules with material from another game (whether just the fluff or some of the actual rules). Shadowrun is a popular target, as it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty universally loved world, with a pretty poorly regarded system.</description>

      <description>So, the online playtest has kicked off and been going strong for a little over a week, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give a progress report. We&amp;rsquo;re still in the clan creation phase, but it&amp;rsquo;s working out well. I was afraid that the online format might kill some of the collaborative goodness of the group setting crafting, but so far we&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of that nonetheless, which is really encouraging. Everybody&amp;rsquo;s different ideas are inspiring and spinning off everybody else&amp;rsquo;s, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier so far.</description>

      <guid>/gaming/2010-05-19-a-quick-update/</guid>
      <description>So, the &amp;ldquo;Book of Threes&amp;rdquo; playtest is getting rolling, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about the opportunities Google Wave is offering for online pencil and paper roleplaying. But since it hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten very far yet, no commentary so far on the game, and my energies towards it are more focused on getting this game running than on doing more tweaking until I see where it&amp;rsquo;s going.
That being said, I have still been thinking about this whole starter RPG concept, and right now I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards a core resolution that looks a lot like the &amp;ldquo;Otherkind Dice&amp;rdquo; I talked about a few posts back, with the inclusion of something similar to the &amp;ldquo;Secrets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Keys&amp;rdquo; seen in Lady Blackbird and The Shadow of Yesterday.</description>

      <description>So, with the revised conflict resolution rules settled as a starting point, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to take the leap and start playtesting. But my current environment is barren not only in water, but also gamers.
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to give Google Wave a try for an online playtest of &amp;ldquo;The Book of Threes&amp;rdquo;. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in participating, comment here or email me, and I&amp;rsquo;ll set you up with a Wave account invite.</description>

      <description>Well, after thinking about the issues raised in Conflict Resolution Conflict, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to what I think is a workable starting point for moving forward with the core resolution rules for &amp;ldquo;The Book of Threes&amp;rdquo;.
I decided to go with letting both sides put forward a set number of dice, and for that number to be equal to the leader&amp;rsquo;s current Wealth score. This gives wealth something to do as a static value, and ties it directly into conflict resolution, so now all three resources have something to do in conflict.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s done! I wrote a quick little hack for &amp;ldquo;Agon&amp;rdquo; to play in a Norse flavor called &amp;ldquo;Ragonarok&amp;rdquo; (see what I did there?). The rules changes are available as text here on the blog or as part of a PDF that includes custom character and reference sheets, and a pretty neat little picture of Odin I whipped up. Let me know what you think! Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t played Agon, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear what you think of the layout.</description>

      <description>So, in an earlier post I talked about some sticking points with conflict resolution as it currently stands in &amp;ldquo;The Book of Threes&amp;rdquo;. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m having some more fundamental questions about the system than just the number of dice that should be put forward by participants in a round. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how much the current conflict resolution rules contribute to what I want the game to be and how players will actually, you know, play the game.</description>

So feel free to throw down with any suggestions or to tell me that&amp;rsquo;s crap, but &amp;ldquo;The Book of Threes&amp;rdquo; is the new working title.

      <description>No really, this post is about titles :)
So, as mentioned before, I have no idea what to name this bad boy as yet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been engaging in some correspondence with my friend Tyler who&amp;rsquo;s pointed me in some good directions, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the stuff that&amp;rsquo;s working for me, and see if anyone else can take it in a better direction than I can.
So, my goals for the title are for it to be simple and evocative of the milieu, without locking in any really specific flavor elements (so, while &amp;ldquo;The Crow Father&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rdquo; has a cool ring to it, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lock in the Crow Father as one of the gods your group has to use or assume is real).</description>

      <description>So, I wanted to keep these thoughts separate from the announcement post so that it didn&amp;rsquo;t get overwhelmed with the information here. I just wanted to lay out a few of the thoughts I had while designing the rules, with the hope that this will open up more avenues of approach for improving the rules (like &amp;ldquo;you wanted this rule to do what? You&amp;rsquo;re way off base!).
First off, the ideas that got me going on this game were notions of conflicting loyalties, and the idea of loyalty impairing your ability to act independently.</description>

Why the vague &amp;ldquo;its&amp;rdquo; all over the place? Because I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a good name! I&amp;rsquo;m totally stumped. I keep trying to think of one, trying to put it out of my head hoping an answer will pop up unexpected, trying to steal other people&amp;rsquo;s good names, but none are working so far.</description>

      <description>So, that first draft of the game rules I promised? It&amp;rsquo;s progressing nicely. A little too nicely. What I intended to be a barebones mechanics document is quickly turning into the first draft of the complete rules. I just can&amp;rsquo;t stop writing! So, new ETA for the first draft is May 1st (T minus 5 days).</description>

      <description>Exciting News!
That last game project that I mentioned, with the reading list? I&amp;rsquo;ve been scribbling away notes on the rules, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to begin typing up the very rough, totally beta, untested at all draft. I would prefer to do some personal playtesting before releasing it into the wilds of the internet, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be in a position to do that for awhile, so I will post it for review and solicit recommendations once it&amp;rsquo;s typed.</description>

      <title>A New Direction for Now</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be taking a bit of a break from my starter RPG project for two main reasons. First off, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a wealth of games I&amp;rsquo;d really enjoy to run, some of which I think would make good introductions to what roleplaying is for adult, non-gamer type people. But secondly, I still take the starter RPG notion seriously, but I realized that paradoxically, an RPG designed for beginning players should not be my first full-fledged RPG design.</description>

      <description>Okay, as I said last time, I&amp;rsquo;m now going to take a break from reviews for a while (I&amp;rsquo;m out of games to read, for one) and start talking about my own game. It is still fragmentary and hazy, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a few decisions that will help guide the process from here. First off, I think I have decided that the genre will be &amp;ldquo;sword and sorcery&amp;rdquo; in a setting of my own devising.</description>

      <description>For my last Indie game review for a while, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about &amp;ldquo;Spirit of the Century&amp;rdquo; from Evil Hat Productions. I&amp;rsquo;ve saved this one for last for a couple of reasons. For one, despite some creative and innovative mechanics and approaches, of the games I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s the most traditional: PCs each have a character, they all cooperate in an adventure the GM comes up with and controls, and their characters have skills and stunts and gadgets that work much like any other RPG.</description>

      <description>Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the game that got me excited about this whole Indie RPG business: In a Wicked Age. This is the second game in my survey by D. Vincent Baker, author of &amp;ldquo;Dogs in the Vineyard&amp;rdquo; of a couple posts back. First off, some generalities: IaWA is a wonderfully fluid and story driven game, with an emphasis on low to no preparation for play. It does this in a few innovative ways that I want to discuss as inspiration.</description>

      <description>In this installment, I will continue my reviews of &amp;ldquo;Indie RPGs&amp;rdquo; that have recently made an impression on me. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about &amp;ldquo;Agon&amp;quot;, a game of mythical Greek heroes. First off, &amp;ldquo;Agon&amp;rdquo; is awesome. I absolutely love it, and if I had like minded players around me, I would run a game tomorrow. It is simple but rich, and it captures the feel of Greek mythology and the whole Greek ethos masterfully.</description>

      <description>Okay, long time, no post. I apologize, and will try to make with the regular updates!
For the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m going to set aside my more general and theoretical speculation about RPGs and discuss some concrete examples. Of course, I plan to sneak general applicability into my discussion, but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become acquainted with some games that get me very excited, and I want to talk about why. This is still going to be a part of my &amp;lsquo;starter RPG&amp;rsquo; series, because I approached these rules not only as potentially fun games in and of themselves, but with a critical eye towards innovations and techniques worth steeling, with ease of use by new players as the lens through which I viewed these innovations.</description>

      <title>A Matter of Taste</title>

      <description>So, before we go into how to encourage a particular genre with the rules, there is the question of what genre to shoot for. If my whole contention is that the real draw of RPGs is the non-mechanical aspects, then a good starter RPG needs to have a genre with wide appeal and plenty of material to fire the imagination. I&amp;rsquo;ll run through a brief list of some popular settings/genres and my thoughts on them, but this is an area where personal taste could cloud my judgement extraordinarily easily, so I would very much appreciate comments on what flavors are good choices for players new to roleplaying.</description>

      <title>Setting vs Genre</title>

      <description>Right now I want to talk about a distinction I recently came up with between setting and genre. Both get used pretty interchangeably with respect to RPGs, with setting usually having a slightly narrower focus. And either one is usually considered fairly separate from rules issues. But in a discussion of whether it was better to have specific rules for every game setting, or to have a great set of generic rules to use in whatever setting, I realized something about the interaction of the game rules and the game world that I think warrants a distinction in terms.</description>

      <title>Rules and Roleplaying</title>

      <description>Well, last time I talked about how I want to focus more on roleplay than on game mechanics in my starter RPG. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: I&amp;rsquo;m a huge game mechanics nut. Sometimes I enjoy designing game rules more than I do actually playing them. As a kid, I once stayed up all night designing a wargame for little green army men that we never got to play because we were so excited about coming up with rules for each weapon, each vehicle, and every situation we could imagine.</description>

      <title>The RP in RPG</title>

      <description>In my last post I talked about my own introduction to RPGs through D&amp;amp;D and it&amp;rsquo;s possible shortcomings as a game for new players, and then a game I found particularly suited to the task, Teenagers From Outer Space.
So why set out to create a set of rules specifically for the purpose of introducing players to the hobby? Well, for one I have pragmatic reasons. I&amp;rsquo;m living and working in a place where I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other roleplayers, and so I don&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to indulge in my hobby of choice.</description>

      <description>I have a few ideas on what elements a good &amp;lsquo;starter&amp;rsquo; RPG needs, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through a number of games in order to find more ideas to add to that list. But I&amp;rsquo;ll start with some of my actual play experience with starting new players on RPGs.
To start with the start, my own (and I suspect many others&amp;rsquo;) first RPG was the venerable Dungeons and Dragons. I myself started out with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Second Edition.</description>

      <description>Well, the first project I&amp;rsquo;m going to share progress on is my attempt to create a roleplaying game custom built to introduce new players, with a strong emphasis on quick character creation, one-off or pick up game playability, and ease of learning the rules.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to layout some of my general philosophy behind what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and in later posts I&amp;rsquo;ll get into more specifics and make references to games that have influenced me.</description>
