      <description>Today I want to talk about something I touched upon in my review of the rules of &amp;ldquo;In a Wicked Age&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;social contract&amp;rdquo; of roleplaying games. This is an idea that has come up a lot in my recent reading at anyway and the articles at The Forge. This is a topic that is so obvious that it is usually ignored or taken for granted, like the sky or the ground.</description>

      <description>Is love, dammit.
And love I have in spades. Love of games, love of game design, love of theorizing and pontificating. But it in all seriousness, I worry that I lack a no less crucial secret ingredient for my design plans: actual play. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through the archive at anyway, the blog of D. Vincent Baker, author of &amp;ldquo;Dogs in the Vineyard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;In a Wicked Age&amp;rdquo;, and he points out, correctly I think, that without real game play to ground your theories in, it&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to build sand castles of wonderful intricacy but no lasting substance or usefulness.</description>
