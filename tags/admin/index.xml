      <description>Welcome to my blog! I use this space to share the very best self-improvement material I come across and my own thoughts and insights based on my experiences coaching highly driven top performers. I believe we’d all be better off if more people adopted the kinds of habits, practices, and ways of thought that are featured here - happier, more accomplished, and tackling bigger and harder problems.
The material on this blog will help you to get more work done, feel less stressed, and to take conscious control of where you’re headed with your career.</description>
