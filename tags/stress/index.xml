      <description>We talked last time about a theoretical model of stress, now I want to talk about a few of the best methods for preparing yourself to handle and dissipate stress over the long term. We’ll cover how exercise, diet, sleep, and mental tools can all insulate you against stress and deal with it once it’s there.
As we talked about before, and as you’re no doubt sick of hearing, exercise is the single best thing you can do to improve your ability to deal with stress across the board.</description>

      <description>Stress is something that we all probably experience more often that we’d like and near constantly hear about in books, online, and on popular TV shows, but most of us have a pretty nebulous understanding of just what stress really is. So, today I want to introduce a more specific definition of stress than we usually use, talk about a useful model for thinking about it, break that model down its component parts, and then take a look at how that breakdown can help us more effectively manage and use stress in our lives.</description>

      <description>We’ve discussed what stress is and how to think of it, as well as ways to improve your ability to handle it in a systematic way, but sometimes even the best prepared feel more than the usual amount of stress. Today we’re going to talk about what you can do immediately when you find yourself feeling stressed out.
The very first thing you should do is stop and breathe. Breathing is one of the few interfaces your conscious mind has with your autonomic processes.</description>
