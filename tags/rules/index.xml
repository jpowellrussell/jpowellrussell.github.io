      <description>I made a thing that makes monsters. I&amp;rsquo;m terribly pleased with it right now, but let me know what you think. If the embed below is giving you weird formatting (on a phone or tablet, say), or if you just want to mess with it, check out the sheet here.
I used Brendan&amp;rsquo;s excellent methodology to build it in Google Sheets. Every time you refresh this page, you should get a new result.</description>

      <title>Flexible Reaction Rolls</title>

      <description>Reaction rolls are one of my very favorite set of rules. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and help me to come up with more interesting stuff than I might on my own. I use them as a general purpose social sub-system, though not nearly to the same extent as Courtney Campbell in his excellent On the Non-Player Character. Instead, I use them more as an oracle when I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how the NPCs would react.</description>

      <title>Money &amp; Equipment in Fellhold</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I find coming up with equipment lists a huge pain in the ass. Coming up with starting equipment packages? Even harder. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I just use one of the perfectly serviceable equipment lists already out there? Because I definitely buy into the thought that equipment lists are a great way to convey implicit setting and approaches to the game. So I bit the bullet and cranked the below out.</description>

One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?</description>

      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of posting things as they come up, rather than waiting until something is &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; and taking forever, here&amp;rsquo;s a few rules that came up at the table last night, plus a few more, for Heresies Without Number.
Weapon Characteristics Flame: Flame weapons have the chance to set targets on fire. Damage is rolled as usual, but if the result is in the upper half of the damage die (e.</description>

      <title>Factions, Reputation, and Acquisition for Heresies Without Number</title>

Introduction Taken together, these rules provide for running NPC factions and for players obtaining what they need from them. The faction rules are largely based on the Factions system in the main Stars Without Number rulebook, with a hearty injection from Gus L’s HMS Apollyon faction rules. The faction characteristics range from negative to positive numbers, with zero as average, to work with the acquisition rules, and the faction action and assets rules have been simplified to suit my own GM style.</description>

Introduction I began down this path working on my Heresies Without Number kitbash of Stars Without Number and Dark Heresy. I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: Darkest Dungeon and Arnold K. The sanity rules are pretty much a reskin of this post by Arnold.</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been slow the last couple of months, and I apologize. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely lucky to be working on a layout project that should turn out to be something pretty cool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to advertise it loudly until it&amp;rsquo;s closer to completion. The downside to this very exciting news is that my own personal hobby projects, like the Adventure Companies one, is going on the back-burner (still thinking about it and working on it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a priority of my gaming hobby time).</description>

These are the tables I use for running Crapsack Goblins, so I wanted to have one page I could open during the game and click on links to make things happen. These links were created with Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s totally sweet do it yourself random generator generator.

Okay, so in my game of Crapsack Goblins where most of the players are still running around in loin cloths, I realized it would be helpful to have some help in thinking up weird and hilarious clothing options for the goblins they encounter. Thus, the following table was born. It is intended so that you can either roll 1d20 and get a reasonably coherent (for a goblin) outfit, or you can roll for as many of the columns as you like.</description>

These are rules. These are commentary for the blog. ** ** So, a few responses to previous posts have made me realize that not everyone finding these posts realizes they are part of a series. That link will take you to all the posts in this project so far, and will continue to take you to any more that come up. By way of a general introduction, I should point out that the structure of these rules owe a lot to Fantasy Flight’s Rogue Trader game.</description>

Once again this text is rules. This text is commentary for the blog. ** ** To avoid confusion with the companies sent out from colonies on expeditions, the organization which owns the colony and employs all of its inhabitants is referred to as a corporation. The default assumption is that it literally is a joint stock corporation formed by wealthy investors who elect a board of directors who hire officers to make them profits, but the rules will work just as well for representing a department of government, a thieves guild, or any other sort of organization that might dispatch adventurers to far off places in search of wealth.</description>

Colonies (All money is in LotFP’s “Silver Standard”) Current version of rules text looks like this. Commentary for this blog entry looks like this. ** ** Resources General Description Food (~5sp) - one unit feeds one person for one week Building Materials (~5sp) - Wood, stone, et cetera used to construct buildings Treasure (~40sp) - Gold, loot, art, spices, furs, other trade goods - sent home as profit ** ** The way I’ve worked out the resource values is a crazy scaffolding of assumptions and handwaving.</description>

So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet on this project, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing to noodle with it in the background. After I posted that table of contents last time, I did an analysis of what sections depended on other sections and realized that the main core that would affect how just about everything else played out was statting up the &amp;ldquo;adventure company&amp;rdquo; itself. I think that this, plus the colony rules, will be the main contributions of this project (assuming I do a half decent job, anyway).</description>

Following up my general thrust post on the adventuring company setting/game thing I’m working on, here’s the working table of contents for what I’m planning to write, with some initial indication of organization. I have a few questions about this that would be helpful to get answers for: ** ** 1. Does this look like something cool? Would anyone besides me get any use out of this? 2. Has too much of this already been done too well to be worth repeating?</description>

So, as inspired by some of the random encounters over at Playing D&amp;amp;D with Pornstars, here is a random encounter generator for patrols from the more militant sort of opponents. Specifically, in Fellhold, I&amp;rsquo;m using this for random encounters with hobgoblin and human gang member patrols. My party still tore through one of these with a well-timed sleep spell and judicious application of axes. Now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to decide whether to charm or murder the sleeping hobgoblins and where to go from there, so I&amp;rsquo;d say mission = success.</description>

So, I&amp;rsquo;ve just started a new job, and I just saw someone else on Google+ talking about a new job, and the characters in Fellhold just replaced all of the hirelings who were killed in a horrific exploding wizard accident. All of this has left me wanting to do something quick about hirelings adjusting to the adventuring lifestyle: in other words, &amp;ldquo;onboarding&amp;rdquo; new hirelings. And so I present &amp;ldquo;The First Time a Hireling is Asked to Confront the Unknown, Bizarre, or Completely Screwed Up&amp;rdquo;:</description>

So, work stuff combined with the snowy death weather that has visited itself upon my visit to Atlanta has resulted in me not getting the relationship map stuff finished up. So instead I want to put up a quick post expanding a little more on some thoughts raised by yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Fashion post regarding the reaction roll mechanic.
Now, point one: Courtney Campbell has done a lot of awesome stuff with the reaction roll and modifying it based on history with individuals and groups in his &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;quot;, so first and foremost, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in expanding that mechanic, go there.</description>

So, this post is inspired by some in-game events and then some discussion on Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s recent post about fashion in D&amp;amp;D. Basically, the party in Fellhold got invited a feast at an earl&amp;rsquo;s great hall in the city. They asked about fancy clothes, I looked at LotFP and was like &amp;ldquo;sure, 20 silver&amp;rdquo;, and they were like &amp;ldquo;but it says it can go even higher if we want.&amp;rdquo; And so I ended up with a silly ad hoc system for tracking the fabulousness (or fabulosity, if you prefer) of the clothing for some hardbitten adventurers.</description>

[Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the Dungeon Dozen Adventure Contest . Deadline is Friday!] * *Okay, so not really a mystery so much as an adventure, but I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for situational use of song lyrics. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through using some of the Middenheim tools to make an adventure. As a proof of concept, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to run through this &amp;ldquo;by the numbers&amp;rdquo; as much as possible, and limit my editorial changes.</description>

Super brief post tonight due both to the fact that I had a lot of stuff to do around the house today as well as the fact that I want to try an even leaner format for the district write ups. I&amp;rsquo;ve just given the names of the chief locations in Ulricsmund and put anything interesting in the rumors. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of The Dungeon Dozen (as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post and the new fan index might indicate), and even though I was already using the D12 because I like it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good size for rumors per district, I am now even more convinced of the amount of good stuff you can put just into a D12 table with a good theme.</description>

      <description>So, reading some blog entries and some Google+ posts has given me an idea for a game that I&amp;rsquo;d like to run, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if/when I ever will. Basically, I want to combine the &amp;ldquo;dung ages&amp;rdquo; crapsack vibe from +Thomas Fitzgerald &amp;lsquo;s Middenmurk posts, the super-grungy goblin city-crawling of +Arnold K. &amp;lsquo;s Escape from Yoblin Town, and the &amp;ldquo;everything is scavenged, everything is precious&amp;rdquo; vibe of +Jack Mack &amp;lsquo;s Neanderthal post, along with a lot of encumbrance and equipment wear stuff that Arnold K, Jack Mack, +Logan Knight and others have been talking about a lot recently.</description>

      <description>So, I really really like LotFP&amp;rsquo;s summon spell (not exactly an original sentiment, there). I like it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;enough rope to hang yourself&amp;rdquo; approach that makes a potentially super powerful spell available at level 1 with the caveat that it&amp;rsquo;s highly random and unstable. And for LotFP&amp;rsquo;s weird fantasy milieu, I even like the bizarre otherworldly results. But for Fellhold, I wanted something a little more thematically coherent, so I reworked it to work for my game.</description>

      <description>In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post I gave a brief outline of factional goings on off-screen using Courtney Campbell&amp;rsquo;s rules from &amp;ldquo;On the NPC&amp;rdquo; as a starting point. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out one way to handle combat between factions, though it&amp;rsquo;s abstract enough that you could use it to handle non-combat rivalry as well. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to touch briefly on an idea about taking and losing territory. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post was about getting an idea of what the factions think of each other so that when players run into them, there will be rivalries and alliances to learn and manipulate.</description>

      <description>So, I wanted to try a little experiment. I got &amp;ldquo;On the Non-Player Character&amp;rdquo; back when it first came out, skimmed it, read some reviews, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t read it fully until the last few days. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about using it for regular encounters and the like, but I was struck with the idea to use it to do off-screen faction interactions, like in a mega-dungeon. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do the experiment here (I&amp;rsquo;m also trying out the &amp;ldquo;After the Break&amp;rdquo; feature, which I just learned how to use).</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m going through the spell lists to try to make them more appropriate for the shape that wizards are starting to take in Fellhold. My good friend (Yllgrad&amp;rsquo;s player, if you follow the play report posts at all) sent me some spell ideas (Troll Form, Create Familiar, Orb of Many Colors, Volsungr&amp;rsquo;s Anvil, and Summon Spiders are all based on his stuff), and that got me started working on the spell descriptions.</description>

      <title>High Level Fighters, What&#39;s Going On?</title>

      <description>So, after being shamed by the accurate description at Charles Akin&amp;rsquo;s Great Blog Roll Call of my posting habits (ridiculously infrequent), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put up a quick post with some thoughts from a recent Google+ conversation, and to work on my concision to boot.
I solicited some ideas about how much damage higher-level fighters should do in older types of D&amp;amp;D. In OD&amp;amp;D and the various flavors of Basic-derived D&amp;amp;D, fighters don&amp;rsquo;t really get a bunch of attacks or damage bonuses beyond whatever they start with (okay, except against 1HD foes).</description>

[edit: In my excitement, I was pretty lazy about attributing sources or making explicit how much stuff I got directly from other folks, so I&amp;rsquo;ve edited the post to reflect that. In adding the proper attributions, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty embarrassing how little of this stuff is my own. ] * *This seemed to warrant a blog post. Here are the (mostly) complete rules for Wizard (magic user) magic in the new Fellhold house rules.</description>

      <title>Fellhold Session 34 Recap and Supplemental Optional Library Rules</title>

      <description>Research, research, research. This session was pretty much entirely the players using the library in the Fyrberg temple to try to find out more about the history of Gurgu, Gurguism, and the complex in the mountain. It dragged a little, as everyone was researching different stuff, and I had to narrate results of their researches to each person individually. Also, describing what you’ve read in ancient texts isn’t always the most interesting experience.</description>

      <title>Runic Magic in Fellhold</title>
      <link>/gaming/2013-05-16-runic-magic-in-fellhold/</link>

      <description>*Nota Bene: Pretty much this entire post is rules, but I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained the convention of bold italic type so that it will stand out if you&amp;rsquo;re scrolling up or down the page only looking for the useful stuff. * 
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to come add magic runes to the Fellhold campaign for a while now, to get that delicious Viking flavor. I contemplated a cool combinatory system with very modular runes, kinda inspired by sygalldry in Patrick Rothfuss&amp;rsquo;s Kingkiller Chronicle books, but I decided that a) that would be a whole lot of work, and b) it would clash with the overall Vancian magical flavor of D&amp;amp;D the campaign has mostly relied on.</description>

      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]</description>

      <title>First Fellhold Rules Post</title>

      <description>Howdy folks. The bulk of this post will be the first actual rules I have written for Fellhold coming out of my reading &amp;ldquo;An Echo, Resounding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dungeon World&amp;rdquo;. I was initially afraid I would simply be using pieces from each with no original material whatsoever, but in the process of figuring out what I really wanted to do, I ended up coming up with something more different than I expected, though the influences are obvious.</description>
