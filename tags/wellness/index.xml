      <description>We talked last time about a theoretical model of stress, now I want to talk about a few of the best methods for preparing yourself to handle and dissipate stress over the long term. We’ll cover how exercise, diet, sleep, and mental tools can all insulate you against stress and deal with it once it’s there.
As we talked about before, and as you’re no doubt sick of hearing, exercise is the single best thing you can do to improve your ability to deal with stress across the board.</description>

      <description>Stress is something that we all probably experience more often that we’d like and near constantly hear about in books, online, and on popular TV shows, but most of us have a pretty nebulous understanding of just what stress really is. So, today I want to introduce a more specific definition of stress than we usually use, talk about a useful model for thinking about it, break that model down its component parts, and then take a look at how that breakdown can help us more effectively manage and use stress in our lives.</description>

      <description>As I’m sure you’re sick of hearing, exercise is the single best thing you can do to make every other area of your life better and easier. We all know this, but damn if getting started doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck. Especially if you didn’t take to exercise early in life, it’s hard to motivate yourself to endure such unpleasantness. You end up with the same vague feeling of guilt you feel when you realize you haven’t flossed since right after your last dentist appointment.</description>

      <description>Today I want to talk about something a little different - my first experience with a float tank session. Also known as flotation tanks or sensory deprivation tanks, I first heard about them via Tim Ferriss, and he discusses them in his latest book Tools of Titans, but apparently Joe Rogan is also a huge proponent of them, and has some great stuff to say about using them in a regular practice.</description>

      <description>We’ve discussed what stress is and how to think of it, as well as ways to improve your ability to handle it in a systematic way, but sometimes even the best prepared feel more than the usual amount of stress. Today we’re going to talk about what you can do immediately when you find yourself feeling stressed out.
The very first thing you should do is stop and breathe. Breathing is one of the few interfaces your conscious mind has with your autonomic processes.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Risk with Antifragile</title>

      <description>Risk fundamentally shapes some of our most critical decisions, but most of us don’t think very deeply or clearly about it. Nassim Taleb is not like most of us. he has thought long, hard, and with great rigor about risk and randomness, and he presents that thinking most usefully and straightforwardly in Antifragile. That being said, while his writing and storytelling are superb, it’s not exactly light beach reading. Below we’re going to talk about just one of the many useful concepts presented in the book, which is a fundamentally different way to think about and evaluate risk.</description>
