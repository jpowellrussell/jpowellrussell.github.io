      <description>So, the first topic I&amp;rsquo;d like to address here with regard to my skirmish rules is of central importance to a modern/sci-fi wargame: shooting stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start out a little theoretical and then move into some practicalities as they relate to those theories.
So, the way I see it, in a skirmish wargame, shooting has two main intentions: to control movement and to remove enemy fighters. The second is fairly obvious, but there are some implications to it I want to discuss, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start with &amp;ldquo;controlling movement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So, awhile back I started on the somewhat ambitious project of coming up with some miniature skirmish rules that would be extremely customizable but still balanced for competitive play. I started with the notion of wanting to play &amp;ldquo;Necromunda&amp;rdquo; but with more individuality and perhaps a heavier story focus.
So, a few months back, I went through the Necromunda, Mordheim, and Inquisitor rules and looked for ideas to modify, incorporating ideas from a WWII skirmish game my friend Lance and I developed a few years back (initially based on Games Workshop&amp;rsquo;s Lord of the Rings game, but since modified beyond recognition).</description>
