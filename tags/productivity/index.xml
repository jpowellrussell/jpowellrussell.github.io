      <description>I’ve talked a lot about Tools of Titans here, but today I want to share my favorite trick for using the book. While every “tool&amp;rdquo; in the book is useful individually, I believe some of the material is even more useful when synthesized into a coherent whole. Below, I’m going to share the one that’s been on my mind the most recently, with a concrete example of the super tool in action.</description>

      <description>To paraphrase Billy Ocean a bit, today’s post is all about getting material out of your head and into your task capture system (not as catchy, I know). Writing down what you need to do is the most fundamental building block in a comprehensive productivity framework. It’s a seemingly simple tool, but it really is the 80/20 tool in the framework. Simply keeping everything you need to do in one place that you check regularly will do more for your productivity and peace of mind than any other single behavior change.</description>
