These are the tables I use for running Crapsack Goblins, so I wanted to have one page I could open during the game and click on links to make things happen. These links were created with Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s totally sweet do it yourself random generator generator.

Okay, so in my game of Crapsack Goblins where most of the players are still running around in loin cloths, I realized it would be helpful to have some help in thinking up weird and hilarious clothing options for the goblins they encounter. Thus, the following table was born. It is intended so that you can either roll 1d20 and get a reasonably coherent (for a goblin) outfit, or you can roll for as many of the columns as you like.</description>

Commentary So last night I was able to run for the first time the game concept I outlined here. Since writing that, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the set up a little bit and I was able to subject my regular weekly group to the game rather than trying it out on strangers first. The summary version is that it was hilarious and fun and the combination of setting and rules created exactly the kind of mad-cap goblin shennanigans I was hoping for!</description>

      <title>Crapsack Goblin Game Idea</title>

      <description>So, reading some blog entries and some Google+ posts has given me an idea for a game that I&amp;rsquo;d like to run, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if/when I ever will. Basically, I want to combine the &amp;ldquo;dung ages&amp;rdquo; crapsack vibe from +Thomas Fitzgerald &amp;lsquo;s Middenmurk posts, the super-grungy goblin city-crawling of +Arnold K. &amp;lsquo;s Escape from Yoblin Town, and the &amp;ldquo;everything is scavenged, everything is precious&amp;rdquo; vibe of +Jack Mack &amp;lsquo;s Neanderthal post, along with a lot of encumbrance and equipment wear stuff that Arnold K, Jack Mack, +Logan Knight and others have been talking about a lot recently.</description>
