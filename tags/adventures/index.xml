      <description>So, a couple of adventures that were add-ons to the Better than Any Man kickstarter have been published in the last few months, and I picked them both up today: The Pale Lady by +Zzarchov Kowolski and The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man by Andre Novoa. Since both are rather brief, and since I got both at the same time, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double feature review, especially since there&amp;rsquo;s some nice compare and contrast items.</description>

      <description>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ57k8grq_Q/VReWYLyKuZI/AAAAAAAAEHg/koeIn53rmSM/s1600/The_Emperor_Revenant.png ## Introduction To kick off my Heresies Without Number game with my home group, I was casting about for an adventure I could run with fairly minimal adaptation. I ended up settling on a D&amp;amp;D adventure that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to run since I got it last year: Forgive Us from Lamentations of the Flame Princess*. *
As I went through, I discovered it took surprisingly little modification to get it ready for 40k, but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up my book for future use as-is, I decided to type up my 40k specific notes.</description>

      <title>Lost Mine of Phandelver: Review and Changes</title>

So, for this review, I want to take a page out of Gus&amp;rsquo;s book and provide a general overview, the stuff I liked, the stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and most importantly, what changes I would make to the adventure. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect it will be anywhere near as interesting or creative as Gus&amp;rsquo;s efforts, but hopefully somebody will find something useful here. Oh, and this will be totally spoilery, so please don&amp;rsquo;t continue if you&amp;rsquo;re hoping to play this.</description>

      <title>Situation Based Adventure Design</title>

      <description>So, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this Middenheim supplement thing, I&amp;rsquo;ve been skimming some of the &amp;ldquo;Enemy Within&amp;rdquo; adventures, especially &amp;ldquo;Power Behind the Throne&amp;rdquo;. Then I read &amp;ldquo;Small But Vicious Dog&amp;rdquo; and immediately wanted to play it, which got me thinking about the problem I&amp;rsquo;ve had with the Old World setting for RPGs: where do you get started, and what do you do? Fortunately, SBVD has some great advice here, but it&amp;rsquo;s gotten me thinking about the published WFRP adventures I&amp;rsquo;ve read and/or skimmed, and I wanted to talk about that some.</description>
