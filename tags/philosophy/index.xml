      <description>Today I run the risk of sounding a bit preachy. Let me state for the first (but not last) time that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell you how to live your life or what “being good” means.

It is a clever way to operate within the constraints of existing letters, but if you don’t know the code, you’re gonna say everything wrong.</description>
