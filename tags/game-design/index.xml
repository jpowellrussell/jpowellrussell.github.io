      <description>So, I like to get into procedures, techniques, and tactics in a lot of aspects of my life: the nitty gritty, detailed ways to exactly do a particular thing. For some gaming related examples, check out these previous posts: creating d100 tables from media, and various procedures in the megadungeon. What I want to talk about today is how to get the most out of mining a book, comic, picture, or whatever for gameable stuff.</description>

      <description>Well, the first project I&amp;rsquo;m going to share progress on is my attempt to create a roleplaying game custom built to introduce new players, with a strong emphasis on quick character creation, one-off or pick up game playability, and ease of learning the rules.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to layout some of my general philosophy behind what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and in later posts I&amp;rsquo;ll get into more specifics and make references to games that have influenced me.</description>
