      <description>Howdy folks. If you&amp;rsquo;ve stopped by the front page here from my Dungeon Dozen Fan Index, then you&amp;rsquo;ll notice it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the blog here. Rest assured the index has taken a higher priority as a matter of community service than my own blatherings. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to ramp up a bit again in thinking and writing about RPGs, and if you have seen the Middenheim posts here, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the final .</description>

Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve caught up to the present day on the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index, I&amp;rsquo;m all fired up about how awesome all of these d12 tables are. Each one was my new favorite as I read it. I got to thinking about how there&amp;rsquo;s practically a whole game there (aided and abetted in this notion by Patrick Stuart, who really concretized that idea). Certainly I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot there in very small packages.</description>

      <title>Dungeon Dozen Fan Index Finished</title>

      <description>. . . for now. I have completed getting the fan index up to date and categorized as far as I am capable of right now. In case you aren&amp;rsquo;t happy with how I&amp;rsquo;ve gone about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve alphabetized all of the linksÂ here, but otherwise left them unformatted. I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that I&amp;rsquo;ll update that non-organized list as often as I update the index here on the blog, but it should be one hell of a head start for anyone who wants to go about putting the links together differently.</description>

Dungeon Dozen Fan Index
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, folks, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting back to Middenheim soon (possibly even later today, depending on what I can get done). But I wanted to take a minute to talk about a mini-project I&amp;rsquo;m maybe one third to half way through: the Dungeon Dozen Fan Index. First off, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dungeon Dozen, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. Jason Sholtis creates totally amazing D12 tables of just about anything you can imagine: dungeon building, encounters, monster abilities, character backgrounds, and more.</description>
