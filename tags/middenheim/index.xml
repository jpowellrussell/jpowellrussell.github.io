      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.</description>

[Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the Dungeon Dozen Adventure Contest . Deadline is Friday!] * *Okay, so not really a mystery so much as an adventure, but I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for situational use of song lyrics. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through using some of the Middenheim tools to make an adventure. As a proof of concept, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to run through this &amp;ldquo;by the numbers&amp;rdquo; as much as possible, and limit my editorial changes.</description>

Super brief post tonight due both to the fact that I had a lot of stuff to do around the house today as well as the fact that I want to try an even leaner format for the district write ups. I&amp;rsquo;ve just given the names of the chief locations in Ulricsmund and put anything interesting in the rumors. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of The Dungeon Dozen (as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post and the new fan index might indicate), and even though I was already using the D12 because I like it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good size for rumors per district, I am now even more convinced of the amount of good stuff you can put just into a D12 table with a good theme.</description>
