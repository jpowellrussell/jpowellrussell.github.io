      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection.

[Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the Dungeon Dozen Adventure Contest . Deadline is Friday!] * *Okay, so not really a mystery so much as an adventure, but I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for situational use of song lyrics. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through using some of the Middenheim tools to make an adventure. As a proof of concept, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to run through this &amp;ldquo;by the numbers&amp;rdquo; as much as possible, and limit my editorial changes.</description>

Super brief post tonight due both to the fact that I had a lot of stuff to do around the house today as well as the fact that I want to try an even leaner format for the district write ups. I&amp;rsquo;ve just given the names of the chief locations in Ulricsmund and put anything interesting in the rumors. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of The Dungeon Dozen (as yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post and the new fan index might indicate), and even though I was already using the D12 because I like it and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good size for rumors per district, I am now even more convinced of the amount of good stuff you can put just into a D12 table with a good theme.</description>
