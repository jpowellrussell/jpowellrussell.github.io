      <description>[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see here. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]</description>

      <description>So, a couple of adventures that were add-ons to the Better than Any Man kickstarter have been published in the last few months, and I picked them both up today: The Pale Lady by +Zzarchov Kowolski and The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man by Andre Novoa. Since both are rather brief, and since I got both at the same time, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double feature review, especially since there&amp;rsquo;s some nice compare and contrast items.</description>

      <title>Lost Mine of Phandelver: Review and Changes</title>

So, for this review, I want to take a page out of Gus&amp;rsquo;s book and provide a general overview, the stuff I liked, the stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and most importantly, what changes I would make to the adventure. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect it will be anywhere near as interesting or creative as Gus&amp;rsquo;s efforts, but hopefully somebody will find something useful here. Oh, and this will be totally spoilery, so please don&amp;rsquo;t continue if you&amp;rsquo;re hoping to play this.</description>

      <title>Review of &#34;Better than Any Man&#34; and Mercenary Group Recruitment</title>

      <description>So, after my enthusiastic blurb the other day, I figured “Better than Any Man” warranted a full review after I finished reading it last night. So, here that review is.

First off, for those that might not know, what is “Better than Any Man” (hereafter referred to as BTAM)? BTAM is a meaty adventure/mini-sandbox written by James Raggi for his Lamentations of the Flame Princess Adventures line and specifically for “Free RPG Day 2013”.</description>
