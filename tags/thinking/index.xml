      <description>Intro Today I&amp;rsquo;m kicking off a series on building a Knowledge Handling Set Up (KHS). There are many tools, frameworks, and ways of working out there for learning and holding onto knowledge, and it can be hard to fit them together into a whole that works for you, what I call a KHS.
This series is a bit unlike some of my others, in that I&amp;rsquo;ll be working it it out as I go.</description>

      <description>KHS Series Part 1: Bringing In New Knowledge Opening This is all about input By definition, to learn, you have to find stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t already know. This post is all about that step. Clearly that&amp;rsquo;s not all there is to learning, but it lays the groundwork for the other steps we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about in this series. For me, the main thing to keep in mind for input is &amp;ldquo;Garbage In, Garbage Out&amp;rdquo; - if you don&amp;rsquo;t start with worthwhile stuff, you won&amp;rsquo;t learn deep, meaningful things.</description>
