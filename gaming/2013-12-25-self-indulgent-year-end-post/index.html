                    <p>So, more family stuff for Christmas day means little time to devote to writing up districts or Chaos Cult generators or the like, so I&rsquo;m going to put up a little &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; post here as something quick.  I also figure it&rsquo;s best to put a post few are likely to read on a day few are likely to be checking blogs.</p>

My wife and I bought a house and moved in, and so far it seems pretty great.  Oh, and we got a couple of cats in February, and they&rsquo;ve been nice to have around. I made my first civilian trans-continental trip, going to Singapore and Jakarta for school. </h2>
<p>Gaming-wise Fellhold continued into this year, then we took a break and played &ldquo;Planet of the Lost&rdquo; for a few months, and now we&rsquo;re back to Fellhold with a bevy of new house rules.  I&rsquo;ve been pleased and amazed that the group of friends I got together has continued to meet online almost every Monday night for a few hours, and the fact that we started a new game with a new GM shows that it&rsquo;s not even just about me or my game, which is cool. Fellhold went from being an experiment in running OD&amp;D and addressing things as they came up in play to being a game run along old school principles with rules designed to do what I consciously wanted them to do. </p>
<p>Blog-wise, you can see that I was pretty deficient.  The blogging year started in April, skipped August-October, lightly brushed November, and came back in December with full force.  Since my shift to a focus on Older/DIY D&amp;D, I&rsquo;ve struggled a bit to find the right tone and types of posts.  I think that actual play reports are not worthwhile, even as a record for me.  Instead, I&rsquo;m going to focus on rules and setting material, and especially their interaction.  I&rsquo;ve got a few projects in mind that will hopefully fill out the blog some even when there&rsquo;s not much going on with Fellhold.  And I&rsquo;m going to be wrapping up this Middenheim series within the next week or two, which has been fun and garnered a fair amount of interest.  </p>
<p>At any rate, I&rsquo;ve got a lot to be thankful for, and a lot to look forward to.  Hope everyone&rsquo;s had a good year, and may your new one be happy.</p>
