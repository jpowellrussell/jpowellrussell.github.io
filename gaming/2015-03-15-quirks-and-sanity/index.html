										 Stress and Madness Many of the things acolytes face are not meant to be experienced or understood by humanity, and these are represented by Stress points and negative quirks. ** ** Gaining Stress Points Whenever characters see something terrible or confront an awful truth, they gain stress points. Generally stress points will be between 1 and 4 for a single event. Characters gain 1 fewer point when they’ve encountered something similar before. ** ** Stress points may be gained from prolonged or especially extreme exposure to more mundane stressors like hunger, darkness, or danger. ** ** Testing for Breakdowns Every time characters gain new stress points, they roll 1d20 &#43; willpower modifier. If the result is is equal to or under their new stress point total, they suffer a breakdown. The nature of the freakout may be determined by existing character quirks, but by default assume catatonia or a weeping fit. If the result is higher, they face no negative consequences beyond being slightly shaken or disturbed, but the points remain. ** ** Gaining New Negative Quirks When characters complete their breakdown, they make a willpower test. If successful, they face no further negative consequences, but the stress points remain. If failed, they gain a new negative quirk, which can either be determined randomly, or worked out with the GM to fit the character and the circumstances of the breakdown. ** ** Recovering Stress Points Stress points may be recovered by doing normal, human things - like getting drunk, relaxing, enjoying good meals, visiting family, or the like. The effectiveness of different activities should be based on what the character would find cathartic or relieving. One point may be recovered per week. ** ** Minimum Stress Half the value of a character’s historic high stress point score becomes their new minimum value - their stress can never drop below this, as they have been permanently damaged by their experience.

										 Quirks Gaining Quirks Character Creation At character creation, characters gain three quirks: one from their background, one positive from the starting quirks list, and one negative from the starting quirks list. The default method is to randomly determine all quirks, but at the GM’s discretion they can instead be chosen by the players in order to meet a particular character concept. ** ** Stress and Breakdowns After characters suffer a breakdown, they must test their willpower to see if they gain a new negative quirk from their experience. If they fail their willpower test, they either roll a new random negative quirk form the negative quirks in the In Play Quirks list, or agree on a specific negative quirk with the GM that fits the circumstances and character (such as gaining a Fear of Xenoi after a breakdown causing encounter with a Tyranid). ** ** Levelling Up Every 3rd level (3rd, 6th, 9th, et cetera) a character may gain a new positive quirk from the In Play Quirks list, either randomly, or based on their actions and character since the last positive quirk was gained. The player in question and the GM should come to a mutually agreeable decision on this if it’s not obvious. ** ** Duplicate Quirks If characters gain the same quirk more than once, either increase its severity or re-roll, as makes the most sense in the circumstances. ** ** Losing Quirks At the GM’s discretion, certain quirks may be lost, whether intentionally or not, through the course of play. Generally speaking, the system is meant to reflect slow breakdown in the face of unrelenting horror and stress, but if a more heroic campaign is desired or if circumstances are particularly apt, both positive and negative quirks can be overcome and removed from a character. This is left as an exercise in GM judgement, though players can of course make clear which quirks they may wish to explore in depth and potentially overcome. ** ** Creating New Quirks The quirks lists, both positive and negative, are far from exhaustive, and players should feel free to suggest new quirks to their GMs to fit the things that have happened to their characters, while GMs should create any quirks that better reflect the particular challenges and triumphs of their campaigns. The perks, flaws, or traits rules of other games, especially those dealing with horror and insanity, should be invaluable sources of inspiration. Quirks would also be an excellent way to define a Xenos player character or NPC. ** ** Alternate Approaches If you like the idea of quirks, but not how they are presented, here are some alternate approaches to consider:

										 Introduction I began down this path working on my Heresies Without Number kitbash of Stars Without Number and Dark Heresy. I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: Darkest Dungeon and Arnold K.

										 Stress and Madness Many of the things acolytes face are not meant to be experienced or understood by humanity, and these are represented by Stress points and negative quirks. ** ** Gaining Stress Points Whenever characters see something terrible or confront an awful truth, they gain stress points. Generally stress points will be between 1 and 4 for a single event. Characters gain 1 fewer point when they’ve encountered something similar before. ** ** Stress points may be gained from prolonged or especially extreme exposure to more mundane stressors like hunger, darkness, or danger. ** ** Testing for Breakdowns Every time characters gain new stress points, they roll 1d20 &#43; willpower modifier. If the result is is equal to or under their new stress point total, they suffer a breakdown. The nature of the freakout may be determined by existing character quirks, but by default assume catatonia or a weeping fit. If the result is higher, they face no negative consequences beyond being slightly shaken or disturbed, but the points remain. ** ** Gaining New Negative Quirks When characters complete their breakdown, they make a willpower test. If successful, they face no further negative consequences, but the stress points remain. If failed, they gain a new negative quirk, which can either be determined randomly, or worked out with the GM to fit the character and the circumstances of the breakdown. ** ** Recovering Stress Points Stress points may be recovered by doing normal, human things - like getting drunk, relaxing, enjoying good meals, visiting family, or the like. The effectiveness of different activities should be based on what the character would find cathartic or relieving. One point may be recovered per week. ** ** Minimum Stress Half the value of a character’s historic high stress point score becomes their new minimum value - their stress can never drop below this, as they have been permanently damaged by their experience.

										 Quirks Gaining Quirks Character Creation At character creation, characters gain three quirks: one from their background, one positive from the starting quirks list, and one negative from the starting quirks list. The default method is to randomly determine all quirks, but at the GM’s discretion they can instead be chosen by the players in order to meet a particular character concept. ** ** Stress and Breakdowns After characters suffer a breakdown, they must test their willpower to see if they gain a new negative quirk from their experience. If they fail their willpower test, they either roll a new random negative quirk form the negative quirks in the In Play Quirks list, or agree on a specific negative quirk with the GM that fits the circumstances and character (such as gaining a Fear of Xenoi after a breakdown causing encounter with a Tyranid). ** ** Levelling Up Every 3rd level (3rd, 6th, 9th, et cetera) a character may gain a new positive quirk from the In Play Quirks list, either randomly, or based on their actions and character since the last positive quirk was gained. The player in question and the GM should come to a mutually agreeable decision on this if it’s not obvious. ** ** Duplicate Quirks If characters gain the same quirk more than once, either increase its severity or re-roll, as makes the most sense in the circumstances. ** ** Losing Quirks At the GM’s discretion, certain quirks may be lost, whether intentionally or not, through the course of play. Generally speaking, the system is meant to reflect slow breakdown in the face of unrelenting horror and stress, but if a more heroic campaign is desired or if circumstances are particularly apt, both positive and negative quirks can be overcome and removed from a character. This is left as an exercise in GM judgement, though players can of course make clear which quirks they may wish to explore in depth and potentially overcome. ** ** Creating New Quirks The quirks lists, both positive and negative, are far from exhaustive, and players should feel free to suggest new quirks to their GMs to fit the things that have happened to their characters, while GMs should create any quirks that better reflect the particular challenges and triumphs of their campaigns. The perks, flaws, or traits rules of other games, especially those dealing with horror and insanity, should be invaluable sources of inspiration. Quirks would also be an excellent way to define a Xenos player character or NPC. ** ** Alternate Approaches If you like the idea of quirks, but not how they are presented, here are some alternate approaches to consider:

I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: <a href="http://www.darkestdungeon.com/">Darkest Dungeon</a> and <a href="http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/">Arnold K.</a></h2>
<p>The sanity rules are pretty much a reskin of <a href="http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/05/stark-staring-mad.html">this post</a> by Arnold. I changed the name of &ldquo;insanity points&rdquo; to &ldquo;stress points&rdquo; because I like the inclusive nature of covering everything from cosmic horror to extreme or constant mundane stress.</p>
<p>Quirks are meant to be a simple way to impart unique character to the acolytes, as well as to differentiate them more than merely their skills and careers. Quirks are gained at character creation, at certain levels, and as the result of breakdowns. They have a rules impact so that players and GMs will remember them and pay attention to them, but their primary goal is to be create a sense of character. They should not be used as an attempt to optimize or game the system - there are much better rules systems for that sort of play than this one.</p>
<p>I got a list of Darkest Dungeon quirks from the <a href="http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Quirks">Darkest Dungeon Wiki</a>, many of the quirks are Talents from Dark Heresy, and I supplemented with some traits from <a href="http://www.mouseguard.net/books/role-playing-game/">Mouse Guard</a> and <a href="http://www.torchbearerrpg.com/">Torchbearer</a>, as well as some disorders from Dark Heresy and the D20 version of Call of Cthluhu.</p>
<p>I think quirks and the sanity rules link up reasonably well, and there are some different ways you could use one, the other, or both together.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-this-blog-post--now-of-course-you-can-do-whatever-the-hell-you-want-with-this-blog-post-but-here-is-what-i-see-as-the-most-likely-ways-to-make-use-of-it">How to Use This Blog Post  Now, of course, you can do whatever the hell you want with this blog post, but here is what I see as the most likely ways to make use of it:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use as one piece of the more-or-less complete <em>Heresies Without Number</em> rules I&rsquo;m putting together. This is what I intend to do, and lots of the specific quirk rules refer to rules changes I&rsquo;m using there (like having HP split into &ldquo;blood&rdquo; and &ldquo;guts&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Use as a reasonably drop-in ready set of sanity rules for any D&amp;D-alike game, or really any game with a &ldquo;Willpower&rdquo; equivalent type stat. If using this, please note that the stress points are scaled to a D20 roll and relevant stats - you might want to multiply everything by 5 if you use a D100 system like BRP</li>
<li>Use just Arnold&rsquo;s awesome sanity rules and a more freeform system for the effects</li>
<li>Use just the quirks for more interesting character creation</li>
<li>Use the names of quirks without the rules as a resource for either positive or negative character traits in combination with some other rules (potions, spells, NPCs, whatever)</li>
</ul>

Generally stress points will be between 1 and 4 for a single event. Characters gain 1 fewer point when they’ve encountered something similar before.  **   **    Stress points may be gained from prolonged or especially extreme exposure to more mundane stressors like hunger, darkness, or danger.  **   **    Testing for Breakdowns  Every time characters gain new stress points, they roll 1d20 + willpower modifier. If the result is is equal to or under their new stress point total, they suffer a breakdown. The nature of the freakout may be determined by existing character quirks, but by default assume catatonia or a weeping fit. If the result is higher, they face no negative consequences beyond being slightly shaken or disturbed, but the points remain.  **   **    Gaining New Negative Quirks  When characters complete their breakdown, they make a willpower test. If successful, they face no further negative consequences, but the stress points remain. If failed, they gain a new negative quirk, which can either be determined randomly, or worked out with the GM to fit the character and the circumstances of the breakdown.  **   **    Recovering Stress Points  Stress points may be recovered by doing normal, human things - like getting drunk, relaxing, enjoying good meals, visiting family, or the like. The effectiveness of different activities should be based on what the character would find cathartic or relieving. One point may be recovered per week.   **   **    Minimum Stress  Half the value of a character’s historic high stress point score becomes their new minimum value - their stress can never drop below this, as they have been permanently damaged by their experience.</h2>

The default method is to randomly determine all quirks, but at the GM’s discretion they can instead be chosen by the players in order to meet a particular character concept.  **   **    Stress and Breakdowns  After characters suffer a breakdown, they must test their willpower to see if they gain a new negative quirk from their experience. If they fail their willpower test, they either roll a new random negative quirk form the negative quirks in the In Play Quirks list, or agree on a specific negative quirk with the GM that fits the circumstances and character (such as gaining a Fear of Xenoi after a breakdown causing encounter with a Tyranid).  **   **    Levelling Up  Every 3rd level (3rd, 6th, 9th, et cetera) a character may gain a new positive quirk from the In Play Quirks list, either randomly, or based on their actions and character since the last positive quirk was gained. The player in question and the GM should come to a mutually agreeable decision on this if it’s not obvious.   **   **    Duplicate Quirks  If characters gain the same quirk more than once, either increase its severity or re-roll, as makes the most sense in the circumstances.   **   **    Losing Quirks  At the GM’s discretion, certain quirks may be lost, whether intentionally or not, through the course of play. Generally speaking, the system is meant to reflect slow breakdown in the face of unrelenting horror and stress, but if a more heroic campaign is desired or if circumstances are particularly apt, both positive and negative quirks can be overcome and removed from a character. This is left as an exercise in GM judgement, though players can of course make clear which quirks they may wish to explore in depth and potentially overcome.  **   **    Creating New Quirks  The quirks lists, both positive and negative, are far from exhaustive, and players should feel free to suggest new quirks to their GMs to fit the things that have happened to their characters, while GMs should create any quirks that better reflect the particular challenges and triumphs of their campaigns. The perks, flaws, or traits rules of other games, especially those dealing with horror and insanity, should be invaluable sources of inspiration. Quirks would also be an excellent way to define a Xenos player character or NPC.  **   **    Alternate Approaches  If you like the idea of quirks, but not how they are presented, here are some alternate approaches to consider:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the names of quirks, but not rules. Simply treat them as reminders to player and GM about how that character should be played and might react to situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the names of the quirks, but instead of a specific rule for every quirk, simply grant advantage on related rolls for positive quirks, and disadvantage for negative quirks. This will take some interpretation for the less obviously applicable quirks, and in practice might end up more like the first approach above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine positive and negative quirks into one list, and use one or both methods for gaining new quirks to represent differing reactions to stress or ongoing experience in the dark underbelly of the Imperium. For example, combining lists and only gaining quirks from stress might represent a game where some people respond positively to stress rather than negatively, and differently depending on circumstances, while combining lists and only gaining quirks every 3rd level would show that experience is a double edged sword that provides benefits as well as debilities</p>
