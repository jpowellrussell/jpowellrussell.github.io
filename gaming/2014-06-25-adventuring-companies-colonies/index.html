<p>Colonies  (All money is in LotFP’s “Silver Standard”)  Current version of rules text looks like this.  Commentary for this blog entry looks like this.  **   **    Resources  General Description  Food (~5sp) - one unit feeds one person for one week  Building Materials (~5sp) - Wood, stone, et cetera used to construct buildings  Treasure (~40sp) - Gold, loot, art, spices, furs, other trade goods - sent home as profit  **   **    The way I’ve worked out the resource values is a crazy scaffolding of assumptions and handwaving. Feel free to skip this section if you’re fine with using the values as is, but if you want to weigh in on why any particular assumptions are egregious and terrible, please do.  **   **    First the easy one: food. I decided for mostly gameplay reasons that it made sense for a person to be able to carry his own food for a one week out and one week back trip with no issues, plus one more “thing” if he’s willing to be encumbered. The gameplay logic is an adventurer can march to a dungeon, raid it, then march back with loot. This is how I determined the “3 cargo slots per person” value. To get to a money value, I assumed 1sp per day (LotFP rations), but I rounded 7sp per week down to 5 for easy math - you can probably justify it as bulk company supply of food rather than market prices, if you like.  **   **    Okay, now we’re gonna get a little more complicated. Using this assumption that all three resources need to be broken down into units that equal about half of what a person can carry unencumbered (or ⅓ of what he can carry encumbered) has some implications for building materials. This is probably the hand-waviest portion of the resources, so bear with me.  **   **    I started with ACKS building costs and converted them to the silver standard as a starting point. I’ve read Autarch’s blogs about a “ground up” economy and I dig it, so I use ACKS as my go-to “economically sound” D&amp;D pricing. So, in a colony context, I figured the “default” building material is logs, so I checked the ACKS buildings and found something that is just a long row of logs: the 100’ long 10’ high palisade, which costs 125sp . I assume 1’ wide logs for ease, and divided by 100 to get 12.5sp per log. I figured it would be easiest to assume that one person can carry roughly the one log if he’s encumbered. That’s being generous considering our assumptions are 10’ long 1’ wide logs (short telephone poles), but rather than picturing caber toss, think dragging behind you or something. Anyway, I divided by 3 to get to inventory/cargo units, which comes to 4.167, which I rounded up to 5 to make it easy. Therefore, I decided each each building resource is roughly worth 5sp (you’ll see how I used this value in the building section below).   **   **    A quick note about weight. A somewhat trained fellow can march with ~35 - 50 lbs normally, ~60 lbs for encumbered (you can get much higher with training and proper equipment, but I didn’t want to assume either a completely untrained novice nor an expert sherpa as the default). Divide that by 3 and each unit is assumed to weigh approximately 20 lbs (that’s about 9.1 kg for you godless metric heathens), which is good enough to go on for now.  **   **    So, for treasure we’re going to have to get even more complicated. I initially ballparked 20sp as a rough value for one treasure unit, but then I decided to work through an example and realized it sucked, so instead I ended up with a value of 40sp per unit by the following method:  **   **    I figure one expedition should be roughly equivalent to one adventure (heck, it most likely will be one adventure). I decided that 2-3 adventures should be sufficient to get a level one fighter to level two (you may feel differently on this, feel free to adjust). Using LotFP experience values, that’s 2,000 xp per fighter, and I figured all treasure becomes xp.  **   **    So, I came up with an example to use as a roughly “standard” expedition (based on nothing more than what seems reasonable to me). I assumed an expedition with 4 officers (all level 1 fighters), three groups of mercenaries, three groups of laborers, and one teamster group with 5 mules. They plan for two weeks of exploring.  **   **    That’s a total of 98 cargo slots unencumbered or 142 encumbered. Each person needs 2 rations for two weeks (the mules can forage), so that’s 68 rations, leaving 30 slots unencumbered or 74 encumbered. I assumed these guys load everyone to the eyeballs with treasure and don’t carry any special equipment.   **   **    For the four fighters to get to level 2, they need 8,000 silver. Divide that by 2 expeditions to get 4,000 or divide by 3 to get 2,667. So, using our hypothetical expedition of 34 dudes and their mules with 74 slots, I got an expected treasure per unit value of somewhere between 36 and 54. I decided to keep at the low end and a nice round number, so I arrived at a value of 40sp per treasure unit. If these still seems low to you, I’m trying to capture a mean between something like prepared spices (tiny and extraordinarily valuable) and statuary or relics (huge and unwieldy but extraordinarily valuable).  **   **    Perhaps as part of the modularity I’ll leave a section to determine the sp equivalents for each resource, but that might have a lot of domino implications. I guess we’ll see.  **   **    Gaining Resources  All three resources can be received as part of resupply voyages, collected, or traded for.   **   **    Resupply Voyages  As detailed in the voyage section, the home company can send resupply voyages to the colony with new settlers, mercenaries, and supplies. Early on in a colony’s life, most of its food and much of its building materials will likely come from resupply voyages. It will be rare to receive treasure as a resupply, since the business of the colony is assumed to be extracting treasure.   **   **    Trade  All three resources can be traded with rival adventuring companies, visiting merchants, or locals. Trade between players can consist of any mutually agreed upon terms. For trade with NPCs, the basic assumption is that one unit of treasure can be traded for eight units of food or building materials, but that can be modified by the demand of the particular trading partner (check demand for both resources separately). Trading food for building materials or vice versa is assumed to be on a one for one basis, but it can be modified if the situation requires it.If you have defined different relative values for food, building materials, and treasure, you can use the same distribution for demand and modify the ratios accordingly.  **   **    Number of Resources Tradable for Treasure by Demand</p>

<p>This defenses section is almost entirely speculative in nature, but I wanted to stick with my established theme of using familiar D&amp;D mechanics applied at a different scale, but with rules for interaction between the scales. I haven’t tried this out yet, and I may have failed horribly.</p>
