<p>
Back when I was about to get out of the Army, for a while I thought I was going to become a farmer. One of my good buddies turned me on to Joel Salatin, the founder of <a href="https://polyfacefarms.com/">Polyface Farm</a>, who has worked out a way to raise animals ethically, in a way that helps the environment, and make good money doing it. I was inspired and bought all his books (at the time). Looking back, there was more than a little wishful thinking involved, of course - I grew up in suburbia and have never raised/cared for animals that weren't pets. I ought to have found a way to "test drive" farming - go volunteer somewhere, keep some backyard chickens, that kind of thing. For better or worse, my wife was not so thrilled with the idea, so I found another way. Salatin's whole approach is pretty cool, but I want to share one piece of it here.
</p>

<p>
Salatin manages to keep more cattle per acre than any of the neighboring farms. There's a few things that let him do this - like a commitment to building soil through composting and using the farm for more than just cattle - he raises sheep and pigs in a way that mimics a natural ecosystem, similar to Takao Furuno's approach described in <i>The Power of Duck</i>. The main way, though, is both counter-intuitive and simple: smaller paddocks. In case agricultural vocabulary is not one of your hobbies, a "paddock" is a fenced-in area for the keeping of livestock. When raising cattle, often folks will not just let them loose on their whole land, but will instead rotate them through a few paddocks. Salatin's paddocks at Polyface Farm are much smaller than those on most ranches. The result? More cows per acre.
</p>

<p>
Sounds bad, right? "Cramming cows into smaller paddocks, forcing them to survive on less land! Open pastures!" That's not actually what's happening here, though. Do you know what cows do when given wide-open pastures? They spread way the hell out. Remember above when I mentioned ecosystems? Well, when you look at ruminants in the wild, what do they do? They huddle together while grazing. Why? Protection from predators. For many reasons, Salatin doesn't fill his farm with wolves, but he <i>does</i> want his cows to huddle together. See, it turns out that when cows spread out, they get very picky - they only eat the <i>tastiest</i> grass, and then they wander over, skip over all the iceberg-equivalent grass and go to the next clump of baby spinach. Cows need variety in their diets, though. If you let them eat anything they want from the full buffet, they skip a lot of what's available. On the other hand, when they're squished together with a bunch of other cows, they eat whatever's in reach before their neighbors can get to it. You've likely already guessed where this is going: smaller paddocks force cows to clump together, which makes them eat more of the available grass, so you get better efficiency while the cows eat just as well (actually better: the variety means more vitamins and the like). Not only do the cows eat more of the grass on the same acreage, you know what grass does over the spring and summer? It <i>grows</i>. Which means that you can rotate back to the same paddock after a few weeks. The smaller paddocks then also mean that you can rotate back sooner, which is even <i>more</i> efficiency. You have more cows, that are better fed, and therefore tastier, on the same amount of land, <b>and</b> the cows are even happier about it, than if you'd let them "roam free(ish)" on the entirety of your land.
</p>

<p>
As an exercise for the reader, I encourage you to think about any other mammals that come to mind who are regularly allowed to spread out nearly as much as they like and do as they damn well please, but maybe were better off when circumstances constrained them to huddling together, finding every bit of value in the immediate space they could.

A bit late tonight, as my kids were home for Spring Break and after they got to bed, my wife and I finished watching <i>The Sopranos</i> for the first time (very short thoughts: great show, stupid ending, though not inconsistent thematically). At any rate, I've been meditating on the words for my take on a "Hail Idun" all week, taking into account a lot of thoughts from the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/223141.html?thread=39594405#cmt39594405">feedback I got</a>. I think I'm getting closer, but I'm still not there, so here's three more takes:

</p>

<p>
The first thing I have to say is that I'm not wholly happy with my thoughts below. I've read the book and I'm thinking about it, but I might need to do more to truly soak it in. I started writing this post to get those thoughts in order, and now that I've done so, some of it has come together, but other bits have stayed murky. That's all to say, I may come back to this book, and I don't know how long I'll stand behind what I have to say below - we'll see how things go!
</p>

<p>
This book comes highly recommended in several "How to Heathen" books, like Galina Krasskova's <i>Modern Guide to Heathenry</i>. Written in 1982 by Paul C. Bauschatz, who seems to have been an English professor at the University of Maine and published by the University of Massachusetts press, it's <i>very</i> hard to find a copy to buy these days, but seems to be pretty readily available in large libraries (I checked out a copy from the university where I work). My guess is that it didn't get that big a print run, since it's a fairly niche topic, but then Heathens took to it and bought up all the copies and there's never been a reprint. I'm thinking about writing to the publisher to ask them to consider a reprint, given that if you can find a copy at all (checks <a href="https://www.alibris.com">alibris.com</a> - nope), it goes for (checks Amazon) at least $980. Seems like a market opportunity to me.

<h3 id="org86e04b2">The Main Idea - Pre-Christian Germanish Folk Saw Time Very Unlike Us</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org86e04b2">
<p>
At any rate, why is this book so sought after by today's heathens? It sets out to explore the pre-Christian Germanish worldview, to try to understand what it was like "from the inside." Specifically, Bauschatz argues that the pre-Christian Germans had a <i>very</i> different conception of how time worked and that this is reflected in their myth, cultural practices and artifacts, and language. Since it turns out you can't really talk about fundamental conceptions of time without getting into cosmology, causality, and other pretty big topics, this turns out to have a lot of interesting things to say for folks interested in understanding Germanish beliefs and lore.
</p>

<p>
So what is this very different way of thinking of time? In short, the Western Christian/post-Christian view of time is the familiar linear "past, present, future," and from a theological perspective, that line exists within an enclosing timeless eternity. Bauschatz didn't make this comparison, but I can't help but see the enclosing timelessness as Magian and the linear perception of time nested within it as Faustian, and the attempt to wed them together the outcome of the pseudomorphosis that produced European Christianity. The elder Germans, though, seem to have seen time as being made of "past and not-past," and of these, the past had far more weight. I'm still working my way through all of this, which is part of why I'm writing these thoughts down, but if I understand right, the main idea is that the importance of things can only be seen in hindsight. A lot of stuff happens, but most of it ends up being trivial - nothing that matters comes of it. Some things, though, become the causes for the events that matter.

<h3 id="orgac9071b">The Well and the Tree - Past Happenings and What Grows from Them</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac9071b">
<p>
So, what are the "Well" and the "Tree" in the name of the book? To my readers who know their way around Germanish Lore, this will be clear enough - the Well of Wyrd and the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. In the lore, the Yggdrasil is said to hold all of the world, and to have its roots in one or more wells, but the best known is the Well of Wyrd, or if you would rather have the Old Norse, <i>Urdhrbrunnr</i>. Now, that word <i>brunnr</i> doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean a "well" in the sense of a shaft dug deep into the ground, lined with stone, and with a bucket to draw water from it, as you likely think of when you hear "well." It seems to have been used to mean all of: wells, springs, streams, and catch basins. The heart of the meaning seems to have been "something from which drinking water is drawn." In today's Germanish tongues, it has mostly specialized to one of those meanings, and in English has almost wholly vanished, other than in a few steadnames that end in "-burn" or "-bourne." The three Norns who tend this "well" - <i>Urdhr</i>, <i>Verdhandi</i>, and <i>Skuld</i> in Old Norse (which is attested), or <i>Wyrd</i>, <i>Werthende</i>, and <i>Sculd</i> in Old English (which is a modern reconstruction) - may or may not have been a conscious borrowing of the Greek <i>Moirae</i> or "Fates," but the thought that the world is a Tree that grows out of a nourishing water source tended by (a) wise woman/women might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">very old indeed</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bauschatz argues that these are mythological representations of the way that the elder Germanish folk thought of the world and time. He pulls together archaeological findings, artwork, story motifs, and the use of language to make his case. He does his best to reconstruct what that sense of world and time might have been like, since it seems like it might have been rather unlike how the folks of today see the world, and even more so unlike how we see time. The heart of what these represent to Bauschatz is the <i>containment</i> of the Well and the <i>branching</i> of the Tree. They are linked by a sense of life and growth. The Tree is kept healthy and growing by the water and mud of the Well, and the doings of the Worlds held in/made up by the Tree "fall down" into the Well and renew it. The "now" is the accumulation/fulfillment of everything that has come before, and so the past is at its "fullest" <i>right now</i>. The idea that things started out perfect and have been getting worse, that the world has been deteriorating in a way that will be washed away/renewed by some future event, seems to be wholly outside of how elder Germanish folks saw things.
</p>

<p>
This leads to a few implications: first, the future is not set, but it's not wholly unguessable either. One way to put it might be that the elder Germanish folk would look at a batter hitting the ball and hear the bat hit the ball and see the form of the batter and think "wow, that might be a home run" rather than focusing on the outfielder running to catch the ball and wondering if he'll be at the right place at the right time. Secondly, learning what happened in the past is of great worth, because it's the best way you have of learning about how cause and effect work. Thirdly, doing great deeds lays the needed groundwork for great things to come - you renew the well and feed the tree when you leave great things behind you. These three things seem like a lot of why this book has so strongly struck today's heathens, and I can see why.

<h3 id="org15095be">The Linguistic Evidence - What Future Tense?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org15095be">
<p>
Very likely the source of Bauschatz's theory, and I suspect the bit that he was most interested in, is a grammatical observation about the German language family. Namely, grammatically-speaking, <i>no</i> Germanish tongue expresses the future morphologically. In fact, <i>every</i> Germanish tongue only conjugates its verbs into past and non-past. This part gets pretty technical, enough so that even as someone who took linguistics classes in College, majored in Latin and Greek, and has read a lot about the linguistic evidence for the origin and dispersal of Indo-European languages, I found it hard to follow.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a quick side trip into linguistic concepts and terminology in case the above paragraph read like gobbledygook to you. What do I mean about expressing grammatical concepts "morphologically"? First off, "morphological" is a fancy word for "in the shape of," and when used in linguistics is used to refer to the sounds made in a word, and is most of all used when the sounds of a word <i>change</i> to reflect some change in meaning. For example, "write" is in the present tense, but when I change the vowel to "o", we get "wrote", which is now in the past tense. That's a morphological change. So is making something plural by putting and "-s" on the end - like "kid" and "kids," or weirder changes like "child" and "children." So far, so good?
</p>

<p>
Most Indo-European languages made/make morphological changes to words to convey what they are doing in a sentence grammatically. If you only speak English, this can be tough to get your head around, because we don't do much of that and instead express grammatical function by putting words next to each other - for example, to show who is writing, we put a pronoun next to the word "I write," "you write," and so forth. To show future tense, we add in "will" - "I will write." There's a variety of historical reasons for this that we can get into another time, but one of the contributing factors is what Bauschatz is getting into here, and we'll talk about that in a second.
</p>

<p>
To make the idea of morphological changes to show grammatical function a little clearer, let's take a look at another language that does more than English - Latin. Here, <i>videbo</i> means "I will see" - the <i>vide-</i> bit is the root, meaning "see" and the <i>-bo</i> bit says "I will." If I wanted to say "I will be seen" (passive voice) or "if [something happened], I would see" (subjunctive), you'd make more changes to the verb (<i>videbor</i> and <i>videam</i> respectively). Morphological changes like this seem to have been a big part of how proto-Indo-European worked, which is why all Indo-European languages today make at least some morphological changes to words to convey grammatical meaning. What those changes were in proto-Indo-European is a matter of some debate, and harder to describe than the examples above, but Bauschatz goes into it in the book.
</p>

<p>
The short version is that it seems like proto-Indo-European was doing <i>something</i> similar to tense with morphological changes, but that the various daughter languages evolved in slightly different ways. The Germanish kindred of tongues seems to have evolved to where you had a morphological past and a morphological "not past." Weird as it is to think about, they didn't seem to feel the need to express that something "will happen" in the future until they started being Christian. Take a closer look at how we put something in the future now: "I <i>will</i> write." We don't think about it much, but that "will" is <i>exactly</i> the same word as the will in "willpower." The sense is "I will it to happen," meaning "it is my intention right now to do that thing in the future." Every Germanish tongue has a similar "workaround" for expressing futurity - we slap some kind of helping verb onto a "not past" form of the main verb, and those helping verbs usually mean something like "have in mind" or "intend" or "am obliged to." Fun fact: "shall" as in "I shall do the thing," is etymologically linked with "should," which is the English cognate to the Norn "Skuld."
</p>

Anyhow, Bauschatz argues that Germanish tongues lack a morphological "future tense" because the idea that you can talk about things in the future as if they're certain, established, "real," just in a different conceptual "place" was outlandish to the folks who spoke Proto-Germanic. The best they could do was to say "well, this is what I intend to happen" or "given what's happened, the most likely outcome seems to be this." As the speakers of these tongues Christianized, they had to grapple with a worldview that saw the future as a more definite thing, something that held the dearest hope of the new religion.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67c817e">
<p>
Overall, I rather liked the book and it sparked a lot of thoughts, but it has some downsides. For starters, at times you can tell that this book was written in the 80s by an English professor, because it often (usually?) indulges in post-modern academic jargon when it could just state something plainly. Often enough that it's actually hard to follow at times. I can sympathize that Bauschatz's task is a tough one, trying to understand and describe a different way of understanding time and the world than you and your audience take for granted, but it often feels like he leans too hard into abstract terms and the way of talking about things that his field expected at the time to demonstrate you were a member in good standing. Secondly, Bauschatz is very clearly coming at this stuff from a way of looking at things that takes as given that these stories, these ways of thinking, and so forth are nothing more than stories made up to cope with the world, nor more or less true than anyone else's. When he dives deep, it is into the language used. He doesn't seem to give much weight to the stories as stories, as units of meaning with their own worth. There are pros and cons when a writer is a believer in the field being written about (and when not!), but here, I think Bauschatz's valiant attempts to understand what it was like to see the world as an elder German are undercut by his unwillingness to take seriously "what if some bits of how they saw the world were right? what if those things really are handled by Goddesses?

Overall, I think this book is well worth reading and sheds a lot of light on how time, causality, and "fate" are shown in the Germanish lore. That being said, it doesn't seem to do so in the clearest, most straightforward way it might. There are a lot of times where I found myself going "why don't you just say what you mean?" I had hoped this post might be a start toward re-stating the worthwhile insights in a more straightforward way, but I think there's more work to come on that front.

<h2 id="jordan_peterson_s_framework_for_myth" class="Post">Jordan Peterson's Framework for Myth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-jordan_peterson_s_framework_for_myth">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-March-02
</p>

<p>
Well, after the comments on my <a href="https://jprussell.dreamwidth.org/2951.html">List of Germanish Books with Thoughts</a> went rather long and ended up taking a lengthy detour into discussing Jordan Peterson's way of understanding myths, as laid out in his book <i>Maps of Meaning</i> and in loads of lectures sense, I reckoned it might be helpful to spell out that framework as clearly and straightforwardly as I might, because this is one area where I think Peterson is not at his strongest. So many of his lines of thinking and research are linked in his head and have implications for each other, he often fares far afield in a way that can be hard to follow, especially if you're new to his thinking.
</p>

<p>
That being said, I once told a friend that if you listen to enough of Peterson's lectures, in at least one of them, he will spell out his way of thinking about a key topic from the very most bedrock concepts up to the widest implications, and he'll make every step as firmly supported as he knows how. Unfortunately, in every <i>other</i> lecture, he will just refer back to the higher-level implications and how they relate to the topic at hand. His more recent books <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, and presumably (I've yet to read it) <i>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</i>, do a decent job of laying things out in an order that makes sense and builds on each other, but with a lot less of the depth than <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, which I found a bit disappointing. At any rate, if I might flatter myself a moment, I've long felt like my (rather boring) super power is to be able to listen to questions folks have about a topic an understand what it is they're actually confused by, and therefore what answer would help resolve their confusion. I wouldn't have thought this was much of a super power, but after years being on both sides of a classroom, sitting through corporate meetings, attending military trainings and debriefs, and so forth, I've found that it's <i>really</i> common for folks trying to explain things to get a question, and then answer something way different, often while missing the fairly easy distinction the questioner was actually looking for. And so I set out, modestly, to try to more clearly set out the thinking of someone who has made himself known worldwide and rather wealthy by explaining things.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org595ad2f">
<p>
Okay, so if you dig into <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, a decent chunk of the book will be dedicated to explaining some concepts about neurobiology and animal behavior that Peterson wants to use as the foundation for everything that follows. His goal in laying all of this out is to give as firm a material grounding as he can to all of the symbolic and narrative stuff he talks about later. This section is interesting, impressive, and with what little I know of the field, seems pretty comprehensively argued. That being said, if you are <i>not</i> coming at this from a skeptical standpoint, if you already believe stories and myths include important information about what it means to live and how to do so as well as you might, you can likely skip over this. So that's just what we're going to do here: I'll give the <i>briefest</i> of summaries so that you can decide if you're interested in digging in more, but from this point on, I'll assume that you're okay with the premise "the structures of meaning (symbols, narratives, and so forth) within stories and myths give meaningful insights into how the human mind works and how to live a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">meaningful, worthwhile life.</a>" If you don't agree with that premise, I humbly invite you to read my thoughts on finding meaning in life by following that last link.

<p>
At least in vertebrates (and maybe even in invertebrates, hence Peterson's infamous thing with the Lobsters), animals seem to have two groundmost motivational systems: to move toward good things and away from bad things. Moving toward good things produces a bunch of feel-good reward chemicals, like dopamine, and moving away from bad things seems to relieve a bunch of feel-bad chemicals that cause anxiety and stress, like cortisol. This leads to a world full of known good and bad things, to which we more or less know how to react, but then an even wider world of the unknown, which holds vast amounts of both good and bad things. As such, we can react to "the unknown" with either the "moving toward good things" motivational system, or with "moving toward, not away from, bad things" anti-reward system. For beings with things like symbols and narratives (like us), we can somewhat choose how we conceptualize of the known and unknown in order to get more of what we want and less of what we don't - are we being forced out into the darkness full of monsters ready to eat us by harsh necessity? Or are we striding into a realm of possibility, ready to handle any obstacles along the way? The former will produce a lot of anxiety and little sense of reward/meaning, whereas the latter will feel full of reward/meaning with minimal anxiety.

Got it? Hooray, we just covered roughly the first 13 chapters out of 68 of <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (~84 pages of 469).

<h3 id="orge1e145d">Peterson's Biggest Influences Here are Jung and Nietzsche</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge1e145d">
<p>
The next big thing to get out of the way before we talk about the framework itself is that Peterson is first and foremost a synthesizer. He'll be the first to admit that most of the ideas he shares are outgrowths and remixes of the thinking of folks he admires. He has a <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/">big ol' recommended reading list</a> if you want to delve deeper into where his thinking is coming from.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing to know, though, is that Peterson's method of analyzing myth is about 80-90% Jung, with a good seasoning of Nietszche, and then finished out with his other influences. In other words, I mainly think of "Peterson's" analytical framework for myths as a very helpful introduction/guide to understanding myths from a Jungian standpoint. The framework below relies on Jung's concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">"archetypes"</a>, patterns of behavior, symbolism, and association that appear to be very deeply embedded in human brains and that show up in a variety of forms across many cultures and throughout time. For example, the father in the story of the Prodigal Son, Jupiter of Roman myth, and Mufasa from the Lion King all share characteristics of the "Father" archetype - they act in ways fathers often act, they symbolize things fathers tend to symbolize, and they are associated with things fathers tend to be associated with, and in all three case, those actions, symbols, and associations have a lot in common (controlled/protective aggression, warmth and indulgence to children, enforcer of rules, and so forth). Where I think Peterson is helpful is in giving an underlying conceptual framework for how the different archetypes interact with each other in a more systematic way than Jung was willing or able to do (more on the pros and cons of this in a second).
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche maybe does less to create the shape of the framework or the pieces within it, but his thinking and ethos underlie a lot of the application and interpretation of that framework. You might say that Peterson's whole project here, most of all the bit we skipped over so blithely above, with the biological grounding, is a thoroughly Nietzschean undertaking. Nietzsche rather forcibly pointed out "hey guys, if you don't really believe in God, why are you still doing the stuff he told you to? Maybe we should figure something else out instead." Peterson went "huh, but here we are, more than a century later, still doing that stuff - what's driving that? Even if we don't intellectually believe in God, is there something else going on?" So that's why it's helpful to have Nietzsche in mind, even if most of the book is far more directly influenced by Jung (who was, of course, himself influenced heavily by Nietzsche). To put it briefly, the thesis of the book might be something like "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?"

<h4 id="org2707ddd">A Quick Word about Abstraction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2707ddd">
<p>
Alright, so here we are for the main event. First, a word about abstraction. This model is an example of an abstraction - you might even argue an abstraction of abstractions. What do I mean by abstraction? Here, at least, I mean a general label you generate to explain what several specific instances have in common. So, you read the Prodigal Son, you hear a few myths about Jupiter, and you watch the Lion King. You notice that the father figures in these stories have some things in common. You also think about all of the actual fathers you have known in your life -  your own, your friends', your own experience with your children, and so forth. You notice that some of the things the story-fathers have in common are also shared, mostly, by these real-life fathers. At this point, you have dozens of specific data points, but if you want, you can take the things that all of them (or at least most of them) have in common and call that the "Father abstraction". No one of these individual fathers will 100% match this abstraction, but all of them will match at least a little, and all of them will match the Father abstraction more closely than, say, the Mother abstraction. So far, so good, right?
</p>

<p>
Well, what if what you're interested in is the difference between widowed fathers, and fathers married to natural mothers, and fathers married to step mothers? Now, the unifying "fatherness" between these three categories is maybe helpful, but much less so, because it hides the very distinction you want to pay attention to. Or, what if you're interested in the story of your own father, the actual, individual human being? All of his nuance and idiosyncracy. Well, now what he has in common with other fathers is almost useless, because you want to know precisely about what is unique to him - even if he still exhibits almost all of the traits of the "Father Abstraction".
</p>

<p>
I bring all this up to make clear something about Peterson's approach. There's a general rule with abstractions - the more widely they can be applied, the less accurately the represent any given instance of the abstraction. Let's think about maps. Imagine you have a military-style grid map that covers an area of roughly 500 square kilometers (10 x 5) with a 10 meter contour interval (there are topographical lines on the map showing changes of elevation of 10 meters). This is a fairly detailed map -  you can successfully use it to find your way through the woods pretty well if the changes in elevation are distinct enough, or with the help of a compass. Now imagine we zoom out to a map that is roughly 5,000 square kilometers and shows changes in elevation at 100 meter intervals. This map covers a wider area, which is certainly useful, but you're going to have a much harder time working out if you're in <i>this</i> tiny draw or <i>that</i> one. The zoomed-out map tells you about more places, but it tells you less about all of those places than a more zoomed-in map would tell you about any one of them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> tends to work down to some pretty granular "abstractions" - some of the entries may only cover a handful of specific instances, but they analyze what those have in common in a lot of detail. Peterson, on the other hand, zooms way out to try to arrive at the six(ish) archetypes that explain <i>every story ever told</i>. This insight struck me when I was thinking about why I was so irritated by this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve">condescending review of Peterson and specifically Maps of Meaning from Current Affairs</a>. Setting aside the other unfair things this article does, what's relevant to this post is that it makes fun of the diagrams in <i>Maps of Meaning</i> for being so simplistic as to be meaningless. I would argue, instead, they are at the high end of abstraction in order to apply as widely as possible. The good news is that the framework these diagrams represent can be applied to almost any story. The bad news is that without familiarity with a broad set of instances to which that framework applies, it doesn't do much to help you. Imagine that you had never reflected much about the symbolic role of "fathers" in stories or the kinds of roles "fathers" tend to play in real life. Now, imagine someone says to you "okay, so what we're looking at here is clearly an instance of the Father archetype" - if you haven't ever connected the specific instances you've encountered to that abstraction, it's not going to do you much good at all. I think that's part of why <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (and Peterson's lectures) is so sprawling - he sees the abstraction linking many instances, but he realizes that not everyone he's speaking to does, so he's desperately trying to cram a wide survey of specifics into your mind so that the generality abstracted from them will mean something to you.

<h4 id="orgec533c8">Order, Chaos, and the Mediator</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgec533c8">
<p>
Based on the biological grounding that we so blithely skipped over above, Peterson argues that our perception of the world, at a very fundamental level, is sorted into stuff that we treat as pretty much settled (Order), stuff that hasn't been explored and could be anything (Chaos), and how we feel about those things, right now, and in general (the Mediator). Order is symbolically masculine (if your hackles are hackling, see the aside below), Chaos is symbolically feminine, and the Mediator is <i>almost</i> neuter, as what's most important about the Mediator is usually being the <i>child</i> of a symbolically masculine and symbolically feminine force. That being said, our history being what it is, most stories have been about dudes, so the Mediator is usually depicted as a guy, with some flavoring of symbolic masculinity. The other important thing to keep in mind is that both Order and Chaos tend to be "static" until the Mediator interacts with them. Even if there's a lot of "change" within Chaos, it's not <i>significant</i> change - it's "sound and fury, signifying nothing". Think of a pot of water boiling - lots of movement, no real change. Until you put the pasta in!

<h5 id="org9c2ade7">A Quick Aside on Gender</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9c2ade7">
<p>
Okay, I know gender is a hot topic these days, so I want to make a few things clear about the very simplified presentation here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The symbolic "masculine" and "feminine" here described are <i>not</i> one-to-one with our biological sex, or even the gender we identify with. Everyone has both masculine and feminine elements within them, and folks like Jung and Peterson argue that to be a fully-developed, healthy person, you need to be comfortable with both, and integrate both wholly into your personality. Whether "masculine" symbolic traits have some fundamental link to male biological sex, and if so, to what degree, is not really important to the functioning of this framework, so if it helps, treat it as wholly arbitrary (see 2 below)</li>
<li>What characteristics get considered "masculine" or "feminine" in this framework are largely derived from looking at lots and lots of myths and seeing what kind of characters are depicted as male and which as feminine. There are a few challenges here: a. the corpus of myths drawn on is almost entirely from the Mediterranean and Europe, from Ancient Egypt through early modern times, and so the myths of other cultures around the world might consistently assign <i>different</i> traits to masculine or feminine archetypes, b. even within the cultures ancestral to the modern West, what gets considered "masculine" and "feminine" has some variation - for example, the Egyptians had a Father Earth and Mother Sky, and to the Germanic folks, the Sun was a beautiful lady and the Moon a macho man. All of which is to say, we're talking in broad brushstrokes here, but ones that are the most useful for understanding the myths and stories of the Ancient Near East, Mediterranean, and Europe through the Early Modern period.</li>

<h4 id="orge807d6a">The Good Side and the Bad Side of the Three Basic Categories</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge807d6a">
<p>
Each of the three basic categories (Order, Chaos, and Mediator) has a good side and a bad side. These bring us back to our basic motivational systems that we briefly summarized in the Biological Grounding above (you see why he went to the trouble to make sure you believed him on that stuff?) The good side of each symbol represents what about it draws us toward it and rewards us if we do indeed go there - Good Order provides helpful predictability, Good Chaos provides new possibilities, and the Good Mediator allows for these things to be balanced dynamically, adjusted as needed. The bad side, then, reflects what about these categories causes anxiety if you can't get away with it - Bad Order is controlling and stifling, Bad Chaos is wild and unpredictable, the Bad Mediator is too absorbed in him/herself to balance the others and makes things worse. Putting this Good/Bad valence together with the three basic categories gives us six main archetypes, which Peterson argues represent a fairly complete, coherent view of how the world works and how to find meaning within it.

<h4 id="orgfa9050e">The Good King and the Tyrant - Order, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfa9050e">
<p>
If you've grown up playing D&amp;D like me, and even more so if you've delved into the Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock fiction that inspired its alignment system, you're likely used to thinking of Order as "basically good". Peterson argues this is only half-right. Civilization and society are heavily associated with Order, especially it's good side. The good side of Order is represented by the Good or Just King. Laws basically uphold what is right, good, competent people usually do better than wicked ones, if you need help, there are folks to turn to who can give it, if you have something you need to do, someone can tell you how to do it.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, too much Order, or the wrong sort, or even Order that used to be helpful, but now no longer applies, can all become the bad side of Order, the Tyrant. Laws catch you in a tangled web that makes it impossible to do anything without breaking one of them, folks advance more for knowing which boxes to check and what forms to fill out than from competence, if you need help, only properly licensed, authorized, and monitored officials can help you, and if you have something you need to do, you damn well better do it the way everyone else does, or else. If you have ever navigated an automated customer service menu to try to handle a straightforward request, only to have every choice you try take you back to the same (wrong) answer (or even worse, this happened with a live human slavishly following a script), then you know what Bad Order can look like.

<h4 id="orgbe0763d">The Kind Mother and the Devouring Beast - Chaos, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbe0763d">
<p>
Again, we're facing a bit of bias from the language we use, as we tend to default to "Chaos is bad". The good side of Chaos, the "Kind Mother" archetype, we might instead call "possibility," or "fertility," or even "creativity". The idea is that the only place new things can come from is the unknown, the not-fully-organized, thus, the Chaotic. Good Chaos is also receptive in the good sense - it welcomes you, it responds to your exploration of it, it reveals knowledge and treasures when you ask politely.
</p>

<p>
The bad side of Chaos, the Devouring Beast/Mother, is everything bad about the unknown, the unorganized, the untamed. Beasts in the wilderness, dragons in caves, child-eating witches in gingerbread houses, all of these are manifestations of Bad Chaos. But then, so is the criminal, the outlaw, the raider. Bad Chaos is also receptive in the bad sense - it envelops you, it gives you somewhere to get lost in, it reveals how little you truly know and how insecure your treasures are.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the earth (as in, the ground) plays both of these roles. The earth is where the plants we eat grow out of, where the animals we eat roam, and it holds the water we drink. On the other hand, it's also where forests full of lions, tigers, and bears grow, where outlaws and invaders lurk, and where our bones disappear into when we die. The sea can also play both roles (fish come from it, but you can drown in it).

<h4 id="orgf60daad">The Hero and the Villain - The Mediator, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf60daad">
<p>
Standing between Order and Chaos (whether Good, Bad, or Both) is the individual, the Mediator. This person stands for each of us as we read the story - he makes choices that we can reflect on, undergoes trials that we can sympathize with, and teaches us lessons about achieving goals (or failing to tragically). The Good Mediator is the Hero - an individual who shows wisdom, compassion, generosity, bravery, or any other noble qualities. The Hero recognizes and values the gifts of Good Order and Good Chaos, and bravely confronts the depredations of Bad Order and Bad Chaos. Maybe most importantly, the Hero <i>balances</i> Order and Chaos appropriately - if things have become too rigid, he brings in the rejuvenation of Chaos, if things have become too wild, he brings in the steadying of Order.
</p>

<p>
The Bad Mediator is then, of course, the Villain, the flip side of the same coin. There's a reason for the stereotype of "we're not so different, you and I. . ." - in a good story, the Hero and the Villain <i>do</i> have much in common. Both face an uncertain world full of risks and rewards, both see the interaction of Order and Chaos in their world and try to take some action to put it more to their liking, and both serve to remind us, the reader/listener, <i>what people are like</i>. In many old stories, they are literally brothers. Where the hero displays noble qualities, though, the villain shows some or all of the ignoble: folly, cruelty, selfishness, cowardice, and more. Where the Hero finds balance, the Villain is more likely to tilt things <i>further</i> out of whack, or to swing the pendulum too far the other way. Often, the villain sees only the bad side of one, the other, or both of Order and Chaos. At his worst, the Villain believes that Being itself is wrong and should be undone, the ultimate nihilism.

<h3 id="orgaf7d5c7">A Couple of Examples, to Make this Clear</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaf7d5c7">
<p>
Alright, so, like I said, the trouble with abstractions is that if you don't have specific instances to link them to, they can be so vague as to be unhelpful. So let's go through a couple of examples.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8d3c8fc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8d3c8fc">Story/Mythic Example</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8d3c8fc">
<p>
One of Peterson's favorite examples, and a film I've come to appreciate more thanks to his exegesis of it, is <i>The Lion King</i>. If you somehow haven't seen it, I suppose I should warn you that here be spoilers. Simba is obviously the Hero, the Good Mediator figure. Mufasa is obviously the Good King/Kind Father, and thus the positive side of Order. Scar kind of plays double duty as the Bad Mediator (Villain), as well as embodying the Tyrant, Bad Order. Nala somewhat takes on the role of Good Chaos by being one hell of a surprise to Simba when she finds him, and starting him on his path back to Pride Rock. And the hyenas are then Bad Chaos (though interestingly, put to work on behalf of Bad Order). The landscape also takes on some of these roles. The Elephant Graveyard, the barren desert that Simba first escapes to, the Pride Lands when they've been screwed up under Scar's rule, all of these are Bad Chaos. The Pride Lands at the beginning and end of the story and the lush paradise Timon and Pumba take Simba to are places of Good Chaos. You can also see how the different archetypes manifest in the same character at different times - young Simba is brave and loyal (Good Mediaor), but full of himself and a bit foolish (Bad Mediator). Teenage Simba is kind and protective of his friends (Good Mediator), but he's deeply afraid and avoids responsibility (Bad Mediator). Adult Simba acknowledges his responsibility and admits what he has done wrong to try to save his people (Good Mediator), but lets himself fall for Scar's manipulations (Bad Mediator). He also shows alternation between how much Chaos and how much Order he represents, and whether it's good or bad. As a rambunctious, rule-breaking child, he embodies Bad(ish) Chaos, but as the one who brings the rains back, Good Chaos. In his desire to boss people around and have his ego flattered ("I Just Can't Wait to Be King!"), he shows Bad Order, but by deposing the Tyrant and restoring just rule to the Pride Lands, he shows Good Order.
</p>

<p>
So, you can see how the application of these archetypes in different ways, and the interplay between them, can lead to a fairly rich and nuanced set of insights into a story.

Okay, stories are well and good, but if you're not yet convinced that understanding stories better will help us understand ourselves and how to live our lives better, then an example of how to apply these archetypes to a story like the one above won't do much for you. So, let me run through how we could use these to think about situations in our lives.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you're stuck in a job that makes you miserable. The economy sucks and you're worried about finding another job (Bad Chaos). Your boss is a micromanaging jerk who takes credit for anything good the team does, and passes blame for anything bad (Bad Order). But even worse, the team is a mess - there are no standard procedures to follow, no one knows who is responsible for what, and your boss is constantly dropping surprise last-minute assignments on you (Bad Chaos). You've gotten to the point where you try to avoid as much responsibility as you can and lie about how much work you're doing (Bad Mediator), because trying to do better has just gotten you burned in the past. Your only relief is to spend your weekends either playing video games for hours on end or getting hammered - or both (Bad Mediator).
</p>

<p>
One day, you've had enough, and you decide you're going to put your life back on a track that suits you better (Good Mediator). You realize that one reason you feel stuck is that you don't have the skills you need to get a job somewhere else, so you sign up for a course (Good Mediator). Through the course, you meet some folks who are also looking for work, and you start to hear about opportunities you'd never considered (Good Chaos). You decide that you're going to create a habit of applying to 5 new jobs a week until you find a new one (Good Order). Once you land the new job, you politely, but firmly, tell your boss that you're leaving and it's because this place is terrible (Good Mediator), and you have a very candid exit interview with HR, hoping that maybe the company can be a little better to work for, even if you're gone (Good Order). As you get ready for your first day on the new job, you're a little nervous, but mostly you're excited, because now you know that if it doesn't work out, you can always find something else (Good Chaos).
</p>

<p>
Alright, so that wasn't the most detailed or interesting scenario, but hopefully it gives some idea of how these ideas can play out in your life. More importantly, once you've learned to think that way, you can start analyzing situations in your life through this lens - where do you feel stifled (Bad Order)? Where do you feel overwhelmed by uncertainty (Bad Chaos)? Where do you act like a jerk (Bad Mediator)? Where do you help others out (Good Mediator)? Where do you have helpful routines (Good Order)? Where do you feel excited about unexplored possibilities (Good Chaos)?

<h3 id="org95bf766">Some Shortcomings of Peterson's Way, as I See Them</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org95bf766">
<p>
Having spent all these words laying out why I think Peterson's framework is helpful, you might (rightly) guess that I'm a big fan. Even still, no framework is foolproof, and this one is no exception. For me, the biggest challenge in using this framework is the level of abstraction discussed above - the fact that it can be applied to <i>any</i> story means that it's missing some of the nuance that it might be helpful to highlight. One example: Jung identified the archetype of the Magician/Wise Old Man, and Campbell noticed how very common that figure was in the "Hero's Journey" mythic storyline. Where does the Magician fit in here? Well, he's kinda-sorta Good Chaos, because he deals with the unknown, but he's also kinda-sorta Good Order, because he often provides wisdom and guidance to the young hero, and he's kinda-sorta the mediator because he helps the hero understand and deal with balancing Order and Chaos. The point is, having a "Magician" archetype you can talk about is often helpful, and it doesn't fit as neatly into the higher-level abstraction of Peterson's framework.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps more fundamentally, let's return to the Nietzschean motivation for this whole project in the first place, which we summarized (and somewhat oversimplified) as "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?" This is making a few pretty big assumptions, though: what about the wide swaths of the world that get by just fine with other bases for their morality? What about folks who still have active, meaningful spiritual experiences and don't feel like (the) God(s) is (are) dead at all? In these cases, I think Peterson's analysis still has much to offer, but his need to ground out this analysis in materialistic explanations compatible with a scientific understanding sometimes bleeds through.
</p>

<h3 id="org9a764f7">With These Thoughts, Hopefully You Can More Readily Engage with Peterson's Work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9a764f7">
<p>
So, here we are. Peterson's framework is fairly high-level, fairly abstract, but because of this, it's pretty versatile. It's a bit like a Swiss Army Knife of story/myth interpretation - in the long run, you might get far more out of a myth or story through other ways of looking into it deeply, but this gives you a handy starting place, especially for those stories that otherwise seem opaque. Is there a female character? Maybe she represent Chaos, Good, Bad, or mixed. Can the main character's actions be interpreted as balancing Order and Chaos? What about representatives of Order - are they acting more just and protecting, or more tyrannical and controlling? I like to think of this method as a kind of prybar for getting into the underlying meaning of a story - it might not help you fully unpack it, but it can almost always help you get started.

So, I'm getting close on my "Hail Idun", but I can tell I'm not <i>right</i> there yet.
Divination has suggested that I ought to go with a single stanza of Galdralag
(two four-line half stanzas), and a few of the images/themes I should/shouldn't
include. These poems/prayers are highly personal, but I'm also trying to make
sure they work for other folks, so I'm going to share three variants I'm
thinking over below, and I'd very much welcome your thoughts on what bits work,
what don't, and what I might change. As I've said before, whatever I land on for
this prayer will be the beating heart of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, so I want to get it

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-opening_thoughts_on_beauty">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-February-19
</p>

<p>
This is very much a "start writing to work things out and see where takes you"
kind of post, or even more so, series of posts, I'm sure. The more I think about
and reflect on the role of aesthetic taste in questions of meaning, metaphysics,
and even ethics, the more weighty it seems to be. I know that it's far from an
original thought to be like "whoah, maybe beauty is a transcendental virtue" (as
in, "Plato talked about this, and it wasn't new then" unoriginal). Even still,
it's a line of thinking I'm trying to work out for myself, and I think maybe
talking it over with you will help with that. Hopefully you'll at least bear
with me, and with any luck, I'll share something you find helpful.
</p>

<p>
In my head, this feels like a coherent, even simple idea, but whenever I find
myself trying to explain it, I see that it is actually huge, messy, and touches
nearly everything else. I had been thinking I should read more about this and
wait to write about it until I had digested more folks' thoughts, but one of the
things I'm trying to make myself do with these weekly blog posts is to do more
of my thinking "out loud", both since it lets me get more feedback from others,
but also since it makes me get it down in some more-or-less definite form, which
often makes it clear where my thinking is fuzzy, derivative, or otherwise not
what I'd like it to be. So, here's my attempt at a short version: our sense of
what is aesthetic, what is beautiful, what is pleasing is <i>central</i> to our ability
to sort out what is best and most meaningful in life. It's not the <i>only</i> thing
around that, but it's one of the very weighty things.
</p>

<p>
What do I mean by this, exactly? If you have a philosophy that makes good sense
to you and you can back up logically, but it leaves you cold, it's almost
certainly <i>not</i> your path to a truly meaningful and good life. Likewise, if there
is something that stirs you deeply, but you can't truly say why, you likely
ought to follow it. I suspect, but don't yet have any way to make my case, that
our sense of what "looks right" or "feels right" or "is beautiful" is a very
deep synthesis of many factors, including some that are very important, but very
hard to access consciously. An analogy I can draw on from experience: if you've
ever learned to draw human bodies, then there are certain proportions in a
drawing that you will just expect to see, and if you don't, you'll be like
"something is wrong with this drawing, I don't like it". On the other hand,
there are certain ways real human proportions can be exaggerated or manipulated
for pleasing artistic effect (think the giant eyes that anime borrowed from
Disney cartoons). With enough muscle memory of drawing correctly proportioned
anatomy, getting the proportions wrong just "feels" off, even if you can't say
exactly why. Now, you might argue that such drawing doesn't carry much moral or
spiritual weight, and you're likely right, but it's a very clear cut example of
somewhere that a lot of internalized knowledge due to practice, observation, and
feedback leads to a situation where that internalized knowledge is perceived as
"it just doesn't feel right". I suspect that most aesthetic perception of the
sort "I dunno, I just like it" or "that just sounds off to me" is, in fact, the
same kind of deeply internalized knowledge from repeated exposure and judgment.
</p>

<p>
One nice thing about this way of thinking about aesthetics is that it helps us
get around the always-present and always-thorny problem of "what about sexual
attraction, though?" If you haven't run into this, here's how it goes: "The idea
of 'beauty' is clearly somehow related to the concept of sexual attraction, but
there are beautiful things that have nothing to do with sex, so what gives?"
This is an especially telling point if your primary basis for understanding
aesthetics, or even all of human psychology, is an evolutionary one, where sex
gets the starring role. So how does my proposal above address this? Well, if we
take "aesthetic judgment" to mean something like "the qualitative feeling that
something you observe is suitable or not suitable to the purpose for which
you're evaluating it, whether or not you can articulate the drivers for that
judgment," then all of a sudden the link between sexual attraction and aesthetic
beauty becomes easy to define. If a judgment of something as aesthetically
"beautiful" is the positive feeling you get for something that you're pretty
sure will "work", even if you don't know why, then seeing someone that will
"work" for you sexually, even if you can't articulate why, will present in a
very similar way. Add in the fact that the sex drive is super important to most
folks, and this becomes an area of aesthetic judgment that almost everyone
exercises every day, all the time. So, by this logic, it's not that aesthetic
beauty is some ramification or epiphenomenon of sexual attraction, it's that
your judgment of sexual attractiveness is just your best exercised aesthetic
muscle (if you're anything like most folks).
</p>

<p>
Okay, my thoughts could go a lot of different directions from here, but that
actually got me to a new conclusion (I hadn't worked out that judgment of sexual
attractiveness is a <i>subset</i> of aesthetic judgment, rather than something
foundational or ancestral to it). So, I think I'll wrap things up for now. Some
directions I'd like to go here: what to make of evil aesthetic judgments (it is
<i>pleasing</i> to torture this person)? Can you arrive at ethically defensible
positions without bringing in aesthetics? Can aesthetics lead you astray? What
role have aesthetic judgments played in my own spiritual growth? All these and
more lead me to want to write many more posts, but I have no idea when they'll
come out.

<b>Date</b>:2023-February-12
</p>

<p>
Today is my birthday, so I'm going to go ahead and take one of my "steadholders"
for the year. I had hoped to get a new take on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_hail_idun_prayer">Hail Idun</a> prayer in
Germanish meter, but my first few drafts aren't doing it for me, and since
it will be the beating heart of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I want to get it right.
Instead, a few things I've been thinking about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>38 truly feels a lot closer to 40 than 37, but even that was "not my
'mid-thirties' anymore." I've always sought to not get too hung up on youth
and my age, and to know and accept my own looming death, but it didn't fully
hit me until 2018 when my mother passed away and my first daughter was born
within a couple of months of each other. That was one hell of a shot of
"you're only one step in the ongoing march of life" all at once.</li>
<li>My older daughter is doing her bit to make me feel the full weight of
growing older. Yesterday, she asked me "Daddy, are you an old man?" and I
said "no, not yet, but I'm on my way there." So, she said "will you be an
old man tomorrow?" and again "no, not just yet." "Well, when will you be an
old man?" "Not for a while, honey."</li>
<li>More earnestly, my deepening spiritual work has been a big help with
acknowledging and dealing with my feelings about getting older. I truly
don't know where I'd be had the last few years gone otherwise. These days,
my only regret is that I didn't find this path sooner, but I keep telling
myself it's not a race, there's no prize for "doing more," it's not about
what's at the end of the path, it's all about walking it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With that said, I put forth my blessings to you and hope the coming year treats
you wonderfully.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-thoughts_on_the_way_of_the_rose">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-February-05
</p>

<p>
The very first book that I dug into after my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year with dead writers</a> was <i>The
Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine Feminine Hidden in the Rosary</i> by
Clark Strand and Perdita Finn. Someone had spoken well of it on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/183049.html?thread=29927177#cmt29927177">Magic Monday</a>
over on JMG's dreamwidth journal, and it sounded like it would be
helpful to me in my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> work. Overall, I found the book helpful and
thought-stirring, but below, I share my thoughts in more depth.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the book makes the case that the Rosary is a very helpful tool
for spiritual growth and healing that need not be only for Catholics, or even
Christians. The book is written with one chapter for every bead on a stock
Rosary, and the chapters are grouped by the old mysteries (so no "Luminous
mysteries"). Through these chapters, the writers put forth that the Rosary
represents a very, very old strand of Goddess worship squelched by the church
that nevertheless found its way into folks' daily practice. They give some
slightly changed ways of saying the prayers to make them a bit more welcoming
for those who are not Christians. They also give some thoughts on how to pray,
such as getting together in "Rosary Groups". The bulk of the book speaks of the
writers' own spiritual paths with the Rosary: coming to it through
"coincidences" and visions, deepening connection with it, and some "whoah, this
[stuff] works" moments. Along the way, they talk about how the Rosary came to be
and what has happened with it, of the Church, of religion more broadly, and
their own backgrounds in spiritual seeking. If any of this sounds like it might
be interesting, read on!
</p>

<p>
I said at the start that my goal in reading this book was to deepen my
understanding of the Rosary as a step on the way to crafting my "Heathen
Rosary", and weirdly enough, this book might as well have been written for that
very end. Okay, okay, not <i>wholly</i> that, but their way of talking about the Rosary
was remarkably helpful to me in a few ways. First, the weight they put on the
Rosary as a way of getting a hold of the "Divine Feminine", but matched with
calls to the "Divine Masculine", lined up with one of my gut-feelings about what
makes the Rosary work so well. Next, my way of working has been to "back-craft"
the Rosary, to work on understanding what makes it tick beyond "it's
contemplation while saying the same prayers over and over with beads to keep
track". As such, their use of a <i>almost</i> the stock Rosary, but with a <i>very</i> unalike
theological understanding and goal, meant that a lot of their insights were
worthwhile to me. Lastly, the book highlights the slow, steady insight and
wisdom that comes from ongoing work, even if you don't know why/how/whether it's
working, which matches how spiritual practice has worked out for me so far.
</p>

<p>
To take these as they were named, the first thing was weighty enough to show up in the
under-name (subtitle) of the book: the Rosary is a way of getting in
touch with the "Divine Feminine." While this was one of the main
ways the book was helpful to me, it also touches on one of the book's biggest drawbacks for me, which is that the writers seem to believe something like "all Goddesses are one Goddess". As such, they see worship of
mother Goddesses in the paleolithic caves of France, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and
praying the Rosary all as unalike ways of giving prayer and worship to the same holy Being. This
is what is sometimes called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LSd3iLCUtU">soft polytheism</a>, which I think is
likely an overly shallow take on what's going on in the spiritual world. This hurdle is fairly readily dealt with, but
it's also there throughout the whole book.  Even so,
I think they rightly mark out some threads of what worship for feminine
beings is like and bring those threads out clearly in the Rosary and what it has
to teach. What kind of things do I mean? Things like kindness, forgiveness, open-heartedness, and
wisdom. The book doesn't highlight as much the matching (not to say equal weight)
between the masculine and feminine held in the Rosary. Each decade of ten "Hail Marys" opens
with an "Our Father" and closes with a "Glory Be" (which calls upon the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost) - so you can see that Mary (the feminine) is very
much at the heart of the practice, but with a weighty masculine match. I
think it likely that this is a weighty bit of what makes the Rosary so mighty
spiritually, and I want to have the same overall take for my Heathen Rosary.
</p>

<p>
Next, this book is indeed helpful for my "back-crafting" work, since it takes the Rosary earnestly, but is not bound by Catholic theology or
doctrine. This opens the writers up to insights about how it works and what it's
doing that a Catholic might either not heed or else make match up with the overall shape of their
set of beliefs. For one ready showdeal, the set of prayers for the Rosary given in the book
leaves out the Apostle's Creed at the beginning, because that is a downright
affirmation that "yes, I believe the things Christianity has to teach" and puts
the whole prayer in that framework. A Catholic likely deems that a needful
bit, where Strand and Finn see it as a "lock" put on the gate to keep
out those the Church wouldn't want saying "its" prayer. Likewise, in talking through the
mysteries to be contemplated while praying the Rosary, a Catholic like de
Montford will strongly ground them in the wider framework of Catholic theology, with
a lot of steering on what a right understanding of each mystery might be.
This work, on the other hand, looks at the mysteries as one set of tales showing
wider spiritual truths. You don't have to believe that 2,000 years ago a Rabbi's
dead body woke up and walked out of a cave to find loveliness, meaning, and Truth of
a less straightforward kind in the tale of the rebirth. I'm most of all thankful
that the writers spelled out how both the mysteries and the words of the "Hail Mary" go from life to suffering to death
to rebirth. I may not want my Heathen Rosary to go through the same steps, but I
do want the same kind of deep, framing resonances between the
prayers themselves and the overall practice. To bring in an
overly-leaned-upon forlikening (metaphor): this book has worked like a Rosetta Stone for the Rosary for
me - rather than needing to translate from Catholic to Heathen with nothing in
between, I can see what translating the Rosary into other spiritual "tongues"
looks like, which is helpful.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the book spoke to a way of coming at spiritual growth that I seem to need to work on -
steadfast, bit-by-bit unfolding of wisdom and insight through ongoing work. To
fully share what I mean, I might have to lay out a bit about myself. Growing
up, I was always a "smart kid" - I understood things quickly, soaked up new
knowledge, and otherwise was ready to do things with my mind. I say
this not to brag, as you'll see, but to highlight that I was (and largely still
am) "brainy", maybe to the harm of other ways of knowing and understanding
the world. This was made painfully clear to me in the aftermath of my mother
passing away from cancer.  Mind-wise, I had settled myself with what had
happened, what it meant to me, how I should think and feel about it, and I
thought I was alright. But I was not alright. My wife at last got me to go talk to a
therapist, and through that and some of my own looking back, I had the insight
that I was so wont to being able to think my way through things, to use my mind
to handle stuff in my life, that I thought my feelings would play by the same
rules, to answer to the same ways of doing things. In the same way that as a kid in math class, after doing a few problems I "got" how to bring to bear the principle
and found further going over boring and unneeded, I thought that reading a few
books, thinking about what happened in a few other folks' lives  meant that I "got" grief
and could go about my business with that little hardship cleanly worked out. As will
no doubt be blindingly clear to you, unless you share the same quirk of which
I've been telling, this is not at all how grief or any other weighty feeling
works. You have to, you know, truly <i>feel</i> it, and that takes time and cannot
be bossed around by the words in your head. What does work is daily, plodding
work, over and over again, whether you're "feeling it" this time or not. Whether
prayer, meditation, journaling, or whatever other spiritual practice, every time
I have buckled down and done it no matter what, <i>that</i> is where I have been gifted
with worthwhile spiritual experiences. The book had a lovely quote on coming at
the Rosary in this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Rosary wisdom tends to grow slowly, building gradually over the course of a
lifetime. The rosary isn't a degree program. There are no classes or courses.
There's no diploma at the end. There isn't any end. We never stop accumulating
the wisdom of the rosary. The beads turn, the seasons pass. The experiences of a
lifetime settle within us like fallen leaves and flowers, becoming the top-soil
that nourishes and informs our lives.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Overall, I found this book insightful and helpful, and I'm very glad I read it.
That being said, it won't grab everyone alike. For starters, if the Rosary holds
no spiritual or aesthetic appeal for you, I doubt that this book will change
that. For another, Strand and Clark are coming at this from an openly "feminist"
outlook, which brings along with it ways of framing and understanding things
that you may or may not find helpful. One showdeal is their strong dislike and
wariness of hierarchy, most of all those mostly made up of men, as seen when
they speak rather harshly of "religion" many times in the book. By "religion"
they seem to mean any group with any hierarchy given to spiritual ends. Another
showdeal is that in a few steads they treat masculine ways of understanding or
dealing with the world as childish or mistaken, things that need to be outgrown
or put aside, rather than matched with feminine ways for a healthy whole. For
both of these showdeals, they share things they have lived through that make it
rather understandable how they would come to this way of looking at the world,
including some truly wretched dealings with so-called spiritual teachers, but I
still think they've "learned too much" from those happenings. Lastly, they speak
in rather apocalyptic words about the way the world is going - it's not so much
that I doubt things things are going to go poorly, but rather that I don't
foresee the sudden and utter outcomes held in apocalyptic thinking about what
may come. I think a slow, ragged <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-long-descent-a-user-s-guide-to-the-end-of-the-industrial-age-john-michael-greer/15681939?ean=9781945810282">descent</a> is a far more likely forecast.
</p>

So, if you'd like to learn more about the Rosary from a truly not-Christian
way of looking at the world, or maybe work at understanding some of what folks have
found in praying the Rosary, this book's a great way to do that.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mark_of_the_wells">

<b>Date</b>: 2023-January-29
</p>

<p>
In my ongoing work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I hit upon the thought that I ought to have something much like the Christian "Sign of the Cross" - a quick prayer and bodily token of self-blessing and warding. As with much of this undertaking, I started from the thought that Christian, most of all older kinds of Christian, tradition has much that works well, and maybe it doesn't <i>only</i> work for Christian beliefs. The things that drew me to the Sign of the Cross were 1. it is rather short, 2. in that short length, it calls upon a whole, balanced holiness, and 3. it is linked with energy centers in the subtle body. These hallmarks let the Sign of the Cross be something that Christians use both day-to-day (before and after longer prayers, when coming to the altar, and so forth) and also "as needed", such as coming across something dreadful or grasping that a statement ought to have been a prayer.
</p>

<p>
So, I set about coming up with such a short prayer-with-gesture that works for my own beliefs and worship. What I came up with largely came from intuition, meditation, prayer, and divination. I haven't tested it out much yet, so if anyone else finds this helpful, I'd love to hear from you. Let me break down how I matched up the bits I laid out above:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To make it short, I settled on <i>Galdralag</i> <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">meter</a>. I also tried out some others, such as four lines of <i>Anglo-Saxon Long Lines</i>, but those felt a bit long for what I was looking for.</li>
<li>To get a whole, balanced likeness of the spiritual world, I began with the thought of the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. As I worked on this and meditated, though, it came to me to instead focus mainly on the three wells from which the World Tree's roots drink - in Old Norse, <i>Hvergelmir</i>, <i>Mimisbrunnr</i>, and <i>Urdabrunnr</i> (more on these below when I talk about the words I picked).</li>
<li>For the energy centers, I drew on those marked out in John Michael Greer's Druidic magical systems, such as that laid out in his <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>. These are the "womb center" about an inch below the belly button, the "third eye" between the eyebrows, and the heart center (unsurprisingly, at the heart).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again, I got to much of this in a way I can't wholly spell out in a way I can back up, but it feels pretty strong to me nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
So, what of the prayer itself? As I said, I used <i>Galdralag</i>, and here's what I came up with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
From seething hwer<sup>1</sup>,//
Woden's drink,//
and Wyrd's holy well,//
Mighty tree unmatched.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>1 An Old English word meaning "boiler, cauldron"</i>
</p>

<p>
A few thoughts on the words I picked. First, "hwer" was a bit of an odd one, but I couldn't land on a translation of <i>Hvergelmir</i> I liked much. <i>Hwer</i> is the direct cognate with Old Norse <i>hver</i>, a word for a pot or a kettle. The <i>gelmir</i> bit is cognate with "yelling", but "Yelling Pot" just doesn't have much of a ring to it in English, to say nothing of making the alliteration work. The sense of <i>Hvergelmir</i> seems to be something like churning rapids, or a steaming, boiling hot spring. "Woden's Drink" is a pretty straightforward kenning for Meomer's (<i>Mimir's</i>) Well, the well of wisdom that Woden gave his eye to drink from. Wyrd's holy well is, of course, the Old Norse <i>Urdhabrunnr</i>, Wyrd being a direct cognate for <i>Urdh</i>. The "mighty tree unmatched" is, also of course, the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how I've been doing it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take 2 fingers and put them about an inch below your belly button and say "From seething hwer,"</li>
<li>Move your fingers to the spot between your eyebrows and say "Woden's drink,"</li>
<li>Move your fingers to your heart and say "and Wyrd's holy well, Mighty tree unmatched."</li>
</ol>

<p>
This ought to work for Heathen's who'd like an all-around self-blessing/warding to say before and/or after prayer, when running into wicked things, and so forth. I'll start using it, and I'll let you know what I find out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-January-22

<p>
I very much like when a writer shares not only the books that they read, but also what they think of them - an "annotated bibliography". I may not have a book of my own (yet), but I do have a big ol' list of books I have read or want to read on Germanish belief, and I thought I'd share it. As I get to the books I haven't read on this list, I might come back and add my thoughts on them. If you know of any books you think ought to be on the list, kindly let me know! For now, I'll share my thoughts either from reading the book, or what I know about it that makes me want to read it.
</p>

<p>
Also, it ought to go without saying, but given the times we live in, I'll say it anyhow: my putting a book on the list below does not mean I agree with it in whole or in part - it only means that I think it might have some insights on understanding the field it's about. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org83e791e">Wellsprings of the Lore</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org83e791e">
<p>
These are the elder works that everything else builds upon. Mostly written down by Christians, and mostly written sometime after folks worshiped the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, we are nevertheless lucky to have far more to work with than the beliefs of many other lands. These works show us a tantalizing glimpse of the wider world of Gods, Goddesses, elves, dwarves, and other wights that the folks of Germanish lands lived in before the coming of Christianity.

<b>Thoughts</b>: This is <i>the</i> book to read on Old Norse mythology. If you read nothing else, read this one. Helpfully put-together and makes good sense, maybe <i>too</i> much sometimes, but most of the "summaries of Old Norse Mythology" below are mostly restatements of this. More than one good translation out there, but I like the Jesse Byock one or Jackson Crawford's.

<b>Thoughts</b>: In many ways, this is even more grounded than <i>The Prose Edda</i>, but it's harder to follow if you haven't already read Sturlusson's learned summary. Jackson Crawford's translation is helpfully literal, Lee Hollander's has a delightful Germanish taste thanks to the words he uses, and Maria Kvilhaug's take in her book <i>Seed of Yggdrasil</i> (see below) gives the meaning of the proper names, which is a big help to understanding.

<b>Thoughts</b>: This is the very kind of workhorse book that everyone else is lucky to have when someone goes to the trouble to put it together. It brings together short outcuttings (excerpts) from Classical and Medieval Christian sources on Germanish Heathens (so, pretty much everything other than the Germanish Poetry that we have about the Heathenry of elder times). My one gripe is that it doesn't give the Latin or Greek, only the words wended (translated) into English.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Not <i>only</i> a translation, this tells a coherent version of the story of Sigurd and Gudrun, which are told in multiple places in multiple languages. Tolkien put it together following the rules of Old Norse/Old English poetic meter in modern English, which makes for a lovely read. Mark that it's a bit of a stretch to call this a "wellspring", since Tolkien did much to work together bits that didn't readily fit together, and the words are his own poetry.

There's a fairly large body of work in Old English, much of it poetry, but all written down by Christians.

From what I've read, it seems that it is very much an outgrowth of its time, and holds a lot of the ways of thinking of the late 19th and early 20th century. All that being said, it seems to be a thoroughgoing take on getting at the thoughtworld of pre-Christian Germanish folks, rather than only understanding their tales or folkways.

<b>By</b>: Kathleen Herbert<br />
<b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: Herbert has written tales about heroes from English lore, told again in a way that is meant to draw on what we know about Elder times and that makes sense and reads well to today's readers, rather than the often patchy bits of poetry or mentions in the Chronicle or the like.

<b>Thoughts</b>: This seems to be what it says on the tin: a thoroughgoing look at how trees were written about, crafted, and so forth amongst the Anglo-Saxons. I don't think it homes in on worship or belief most of all, but trees were very weighty in Anglo-Saxon belief, even in Christian times (see "The Dream of the Rood" for a showdeal, which is a poem about the crucifixion the way the tree that became the cross saw it).

<b>Thoughts</b>: Lecouteux is a French thinker who has pulled together much work on "folklore" rather than on the writings of elder times above, which makes him a helpful complement. Many of his books have only been translated into English in the last ten years or so, so I think he hasn't hit the English-speaking world as hard as the amount and worth of his work maybe should. I'm still only dipping my toes into his stuff, but it is wonderful to find someone talking about things I want to learn about, but coming at it from a wholly different grounding than what I already know.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Pollington has become one of my best-loved writers on all things Anglo-Saxon. His work is thorough, with wide-faring citations and careful bringing together of widespread threads. He also strikes a balance between sharing what implications a bit of evidence might have, while being careful to call out what is well-grounded and what is more out-there. This book does a wonderful job of finding the links between the Old English evidence (often scant) and the Nordic lore that is so much more thorough. If your interest in Germanish lore, belief, or worship is at all Anglo-Saxon flavored, this book is well worth your time.

This bit could likely be built out far more, most of all if I ever settle on taking on Old Norse or today's German. For now, this is weighted toward my liking of Old English. Mark also that this bit hold works on Runes as a way of writing rather than as a tool for magic. It's helpful to know that many "serious" folks whose field of learning is the Runes lean toward putting very little weight on their use for magic at all, ever, since they do not wish to be overly linked with folks today who seek to use the runes for magic.

<p>
While not straightforwardly about Germanish belief, these works look into what we might know or guess about the forebearers that Germanish folks shared with other folks of Eurasia. These can be a wellspring of surprising insights, but should also be taken with the right amount of salt, for almost the whole field comes from folks going "this thing calls this other thing to mind", whether that be words that sound alike, tales that go along the same lines, or Gods that took similar worship. Professional men and women of learning work very hard to put these likenesses on the strongest footing they might, but at the end of the day, they make a call on what they deem believable and what not, so be careful taking any of their conclusions without giving them your own thought. Mark that if you start going down this path, then works of lore for <i>every other Indo-European folk</i> might have a bearing on what you can work out, but I've deemed those out of scope for this list, lest it grow to even more laughable length.

<b>By</b>: Mircea Eliade<br />
<b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: A beast of a four-part series, Eliade draws upon a great wealth of stories, belief, and so forth from very unalike folks, lands, and ways of worshiping to try to give an overall look at what belief/worship look like around the world and through time. His biggest problem seems to be wanting to squeeze everything into a sequence of "primitive &#x2013;&gt; better &#x2013;&gt; best".

<p>
<b>By</b>: Mircea Eliade<br />
<b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: One of Eliade's foundational works, but much shorter than his mammoth four part series, I've been meaning to read this for years. Lays out what seems to be common amongst folks of very different lands and ways of worship for what counts as "hallowed" and what as "to do with normal life".

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org678d2ed">
<p>
<b>By</b>: Mircea Eliade<br />
<b>Have I Read It?</b>: About halfway.<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: Eliade uses "shamanism" fairly broadly and looks at what he thinks might have been the common way of working with Gods and spirits before "religions" arose. He has the strength of great knowledge of the breadth and depth of religious practice, but is maybe too ready to fit it into neat conceptual schemes.

<h5 id="org1fbb5f5">The Shaman: Patterns of Siberian and Ojibway Healing</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1fbb5f5">
<p>
<b>By</b>:John A. Grim<br />
<b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: It seems that this book is <i>mostly</i> about the author's anthropological study experience with the Ojibway, and a later edition cuts out all the stuff on the Yakutia and other Siberian tribes, but the similarities are interesting and useful if you think that much of what underlies "shamanic" ways of doing things goes all the way back to the folks from whom sprang the Indo-Europeans as well as Native American Indians, the "Ancient North Eurasians" as they're called in genetic science papers.

These books are written by folks who worship the Germanish Gods and/or do magic founded in Germanish ways. Unlike the Learned Works above, these often lean more heavily on what the writers themselves have seen, thought, felt, or done. For folks who want to work out their own way of worshiping or doing magic, these helpfully fill in the gaps left by the Lore

As I said above, "shamanism" is a word that gets used for many unalike things, but the ways of the folks who live about the North pole gave us the name, and I think it likely those ways left some mark on the ways of the Norse at least, and maybe the wider Germanish world. The books below are all by Raven Kaldera and/or Galina Krasskova, and they have a way of looking at things that is rather unlike other folks, so take with as much salt as seems right to you.

<h3 id="org0a1dba8">The Rules</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a1dba8">
<p>
For all of 2022, I set myself the goal of reading only books by writers who had
died before I began reading it, unless the book was 1. needed for work, 2. about
a hands-on skill that I put to work in 2022, or 3. written by a friend or kin.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad I did it, I think it was good for me, and now I'd like to share a bit
about how it went and what I learned.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf52dd38" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf52dd38">What Went Well</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf52dd38">
<p>
First off, I met my goal, so huzzah! Since I made this boast publicly and told
my friends and family about it, it helped very much whenever I found myself
wanting to bend or break my rules. One of my goals for the year was to read more
old books, and this helped me do so. I also wanted to use it as a spur to read
more "great" or otherwise intimidating books, and it helped me there as well -
among others, I read Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i> (both volumes) and
Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.
</p>

<p>
This also drove me to think more about my reading and where I
might look to answer a question - if I wanted to read about a something, I had
to try to find a book about it by someone who was dead. Brand new field like the
blockchain? Too bad, maybe this isn't the year for cutting edge stuff.
</p>

<p>
When I found myself wanting to read books by living authors, I had to stew on it
for a while. Sometimes I found that my yearning for a book cooled after a few
weeks, but with a handful, I was literally counting the days to the New Year.
I've already read two short books I'd been wanting to get to for months now, and
it felt like a real treat to get to them at last.
</p>

<p>
Another of my main goals was to open myself up to ways of thinking not tangled
up in the trends and prejudices of today. Sure enough, these books were at times
refreshing, shocking, or both.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I think this was great New Year's goal. It could bend to fit my
changing tastes, needs at work, and even having a baby. On the other hand, it
was spelled out well enough to make it easy to know if I was following it or not
and binding enough to get me to act differently than I would have without it. If
any of that grabs you, consider giving a shot sometime.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2b88a15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2b88a15">What Might Have Gone Better</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b88a15">
<p>
While I think the goal was a good one and the year went well, there were a few
less-thrilling things. First off, I read a <i>lot</i> less: 17 books against 46 in
2021 (not including comics). To be fair to my goal, I don't think it's the only,
or even the main, driver of why I read less - I would put that more on a larger
teaching load, long books to read, a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinet/">note-taking system</a>, and most of all,
having a new baby for the last few months of the year. I also got deeper
into my spiritual practice and took up a bit of leatherworking over the summer,
so there were those as well.
</p>

<p>
Also, and this one might be thanks to my goal, it was much harder for me to get
into most of the fiction I chose. When I really love a novel, I'll pick it up
whenever I get a spare moment, whereas if I merely like it, it'll only get 10-15
minutes before bed, if I don't just fall face first into bed. I also missed
comics and graphic novels. It seems my tastes run much more with the times with
fiction than non-fiction. Of course, there are lots of comics whose authors have
died and every kind of fiction imaginable, but for whatever reason, this bit was
less successful for me.
</p>

<p>
I also could have set my rules more clearly for edge cases: does looking up an
entry in a reference book count? How about finding a saying from something I've
already read? Or checking a book's index for a key word? How about the book I'm
getting meditation themes from? Or an art book where I'm looking at the
pictures?
</p>

<p>
I ended up settling on "referencing" not counting as "reading", and a small
amount of skimming to get the gist of a book was okay, as long as I didn't
linger too long on any bits. I counted meditation themes as "learning a hands-on
skill" and looking at art books didn't count as "reading", though it was a good
reminder to go look for older stuff instead of only looking at the latest art.
</p>

<p>
I felt like all of this was in keeping with my why I set the goal, which was
mostly for books I would read cover-to-cover but I would have felt better about
it if I wasn't asking myself if I was "cheating."
</p>

<p>
Likely the closest I came to fudging the goal was spending a <i>lot</i> of time reading
blogs. Maybe too much time. Maybe time that would have been given to books if
not for the goal.
</p>

<p>
For example, I read the whole archive of <i>Unqualified Reservations</i> and <i>Gray
Mirror</i> by Curtis Yarvin, the former of which includes many series that have been
sold as e-books. I ended up counting it as okay so long as I read it "as a
blog" - in my browser, post-by-post, and in the order they were posted, not how
they were put together for publication.
</p>

<p>
This was more a case of sticking to the letter of my goal while bending the
spirit a fair bit - I spent hours and hours reading long-form prose by living
folks, about the same things I would have read books about if not for my goal.
So, as much as the goal was meant to take away distractions so I could read
stuff I might otherwise put off, reading blogs so much went against that.
</p>

<h3 id="org3cd28cf">What I'm Doing This Year</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3cd28cf">
<p>
This year (2023) I settled on a goal for output instead of input: every week I
will put up a blog post. I'd like to post here to my webstead weekly, but in a
crunch, I will count shorter/less polished pieces on my [dreamwidth journal] as
meeting my goal.
</p>

<p>
The thinking here is to get myself used to writing and sharing it with others
often. If anyone bothers to read it, that's gravy.
</p>

<p>
To meet this goal, I'll be treating the "week" as Monday to Sunday, though I'd
like to get to where I'm posting in the middle of the week anyway and the point
will be moot. Since consistency is my goal, "make up" posts are better than
nothing, but more than 5 will be a loss. Likewise, more than 5 posts that are
<i>only</i> placeholders (like one or two sentences that don't say much worth reading)
will be a loss.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully you'll join me for this trek, and we'll both find it worthwhile!

<p>
I've always liked learning about mythology and religion, but most of my tries at prayer or worship left me cold. I gave it a shot for a bit in college, but by a few years ago, I had pretty well settled into a scientific materialistic atheism, or at least a pretty hard-edged agnosticism - I thought there was nothing reasonable you could say about things that weren't available to the five senses, so why speculate. Then, much to my surprise, about a year and a half ago (mid 2021), I had what seems to have been a pretty classic religious experience. Since then, I've been taking a new look at much of how I think about the world, and it's been a wild ride. At this point, I can still remember how the world looked as a materialist, but now I see things differently. Standing astride these two worldviews, I think I might be able to help out anyone looking across that chasm and wondering what's on the other side, and if it's worth finding a way over.

<p>
The reader I have in mind for this post is someone with a pretty firm grounding in how the world works - likely you know a basic outline of history, some understanding of physics and biology, and enough psychology that folks' day-to-day foibles don't surprise you too much. Maybe one of these fields grabs you more, and you've gone deeper there, but basically, you don't look at history, or technology, or politics and feel totally perplexed. Things may not be where you'd like, but they at least make sense. Amongst all of that, though, something's under-developed: a sense of meaning. Very likely you've read some philosophy, some self-help, maybe you've tried out meditation or gratitude journaling or the like. If your mostly-good-enough worldview falls short precisely at the most important questions ("what's it all about?", "what should I do with my life?", and so forth), then I hope this post might help you out.

<h4 id="org2169ea2">By "Spiritual", I Mean Whatever Makes Life Worth Living</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2169ea2">
<p>
Before we go further, I wanted to pin down what I mean by "spiritual," since I'll be talking about it a lot below. Trying to define "spiritual" or "spirituality" is notoriously tough, so I'm going to go with an open-ended definition for this post. When I say "spiritual" (in this post at least), what I mean is whatever beliefs, experiences, and practices that strengthen the feeling that life is fundamentally good and worth living over the long-term. That last bit is important, because otherwise we might rope in a lot of short-term enjoyable experiences, like drugs or casual sex, that few folks would give much weight to as "spiritually significant". Also, I use the word "strengthen", because I don't think many things are well-served by a binary of "spiritual/not-spiritual." Maybe having an enchanting encounter with an attractive member of your preferred sex is "spiritual" if you've been feeling cold and lonely, but it is likely to be less spiritually weighty than building a life-long partnership with someone and raising a family. So, for my definition, "spiritual" is continuous, not categorical.

<h4 id="org508913f">Start From Where You Are</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org508913f">
<p>
The most important thing on the spiritual path is to take your own experience seriously. Questions of meaning and spiritual significance are deeply personal, and your answers are likely to be even more so. First, take stock of why you're even asking these questions - are you feeling bitter, depressed, or angry? Is life going "fine", but it feels like something is missing? Are there niggling little edges of your model of the world that don't quite work? Have you had an experience you can't wholly explain? Wherever you're starting, be honest with yourself. Folks often use "I'm just being honest" as an excuse to be overly harsh, even towards themselves. So don't do that, but also don't try to pretend everything is fine if it isn't. 
</p>

<p>
Wherever you and your beliefs are, though, there are very likely things you can do to move your life toward something you like better. If you just can't take religious claims as anything other than wishful thinking for stupid people, if you try to pray or do rituals, it's going to feel hollow and dumb. So, if that's you, don't start there. Maybe something like reading philosophy and meditating on it could work for you. Maybe even that feels too "woo woo" for you: if so, try looking for some scientifically validated practices like gratitude journaling or getting regular exercise. If you feel like your mental/emotional state could be better, you're almost certainly right, but your path to get there is unlikely to be the same as anyone else's. Down the way, it might take you to some funky places, but for now, you have to start from where you are.

<h4 id="org185d043">Find Credible Folks Rather than Believable Claims</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org185d043">
<p>
Okay, let's imagine that you've taken a good, hard look at your life and what you believe about it, and you're thinking something like "this isn't quite working for me."
</p>

<p>
So, you settle on widening your outlook, and you start reading some folks outside of your comfort zone - self-help gurus, philosophers, religious folks, maybe even occultists. As you do, you run into things that leave you scratching your head at best or scoffing in disbelief at worst. One of the pitfalls of spiritual writers, especially alternative spiritual writers, is a whole lot of "woo". If you're coming from any kind of rationalist background, it's easy to run into stuff that you just can't take seriously at all. They are operating from an <i>utterly</i> different epistemological/metaphysical basis, and they take for granted things about the world that seem obviously wrong to you. You end up finding yourself in a wilderness of wild claims about how the world works and what might make your life better. Let's take a common example: most religious folks believe in the actual, external reality of one or more sentient beings that happen not to have bodies (Gods, angels, spirits, and so forth). If you are coming from a materialist viewpoint, this claim is patently nonsense. Those religious people then claim that talking to some of these non-physical beings can make your life much better. So, how do you handle this recommendation to start praying?
</p>

<p>
Here's my take: look for writers that you find credible about <i>something</i>, and work on holding off judgment on the weirder, woo-woo-ier stuff they talk about. Look for fields where their judgment and reasoning make sense to you. Over time, you might find yourself going "this person is smart, grounded, and reasonable about just about everything, why does he believe this crazy stuff?" With a truly open mind, that's a helpful stead to find yourself in. If you think about it, you pretty much do this all the time -  everyone you know has a quirky set of beliefs about the world, some of which you'll hold with and some you won't. For one easy example, I'm willing to bet you have someone among your friends or kinsfolk that you like and think well of, but with whom you will <i>not</i> talk politics.
</p>

<p>
So, when weighing the worth of spiritual writers, look at those of their beliefs about the world which you <i>can</i> more readily evaluate. Do they talk about history, or politics, or psychology, or literature, or other non-spiritual matters? Do they make sense when they do? The goal here is to ask yourself "does this person seem trustworthy overall?" If they seem nuts about everything, chances are good they're nuts about spiritual matters too. On the other hand, if they seem like calm, thoughtful folks with a clear outlook on the world, and yet they happen to believe something that seems obviously impossible to you, well, now that's interesting, isn't it? These are the folks you'll want to pay attention to.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6d5e803">
<p>
Since the definition we're using for spirituality here grounds out in how you live your life, there's a helpful rule of thumb you can apply to would-be spiritual teachers that comes from one of the best-known spiritual teachers of all time, Jesus: "by their fruits ye shall know them." In other words, look at what kind of outcomes this guy has in his own life. How does he treat others? Is he surrounded by scandal? Is his life a raging dumpster fire? It's always helpful to think through these questions when taking someone's advice, but it's even more weighty for philosophical or spiritual things, since their <i>whole point</i> is making your life better. Look out for folks who seem to make sense, but whose lives are a mess.

<h4 id="orgc53e861">Consciousness is Not Available to the Five Senses</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc53e861">
<p>
One rationalist argument that I always found convincing was that you can't meaningfully reason about things that are not available to the five senses. In other words, if there are things about the world that we can't experience with our senses, we have no way of knowing about them for sure, so we shouldn't bother speculating. Further, since the world can seemingly be explained pretty darn well by those things that <i>are</i> available to the senses, it's very likely extraneous to assume there's anything else. This <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=161">post</a> by Eric S. Raymond is a good example of that kind of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty comfortable with such reasoning until I read <i>A World Full of Gods</i> by John Michael Greer. He made a point that blew a big hole in that comfortable line of reasoning. We <i>do</i> in fact have an important element of experience that is not available to the five senses: the contents of our consciousness. Thoughts, imaginations, emotions. These are obviously important parts of our experience, but they are not accessible to anyone's senses. The typical materialist explanation is that these experiences are just epiphenomena of the matter in our skulls, but that "just" is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting. If there's one hugely important area of our experience that is <i>not</i> amenable to the five senses, then there might be others. One area worth giving some consideration is one that every single human culture we have a record of (except ours recently) has found self-evident: the reality of spiritual beings.

<h5 id="orgdbeb140">Reason is a Helpful Tool, but Some Things are Subjective</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdbeb140">
<p>
What all of the above led me to is that reason is an incredibly helpful tool, but it's not the end-all, be-all for understanding the world and our experience of it. If you begin any kind of spiritual practice, even just journaling or meditating, you will run into a lot of experiences that you can't verify or validate with other folks - they will be wholly subjective to you. Some of those wholly subjective experiences might feel tremendously important, but you won't be able to <i>confirm</i> them empirically or through formal rationality. Does that mean you should ignore them or discount them?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org51a70b2">
<p>
Okay, the above points were about the sources you check out and how you think about them, but this one is for you. From my own experience, what you think is true about the world is <i>much</i> less important than what you do. You might believe that it's great to treat everybody with loving-kindness, but if you keep acting like a dick, that's not worth much. I have some thoughts on what practices might be most helpful, but the core idea is <i>regular practice</i> - pick something you think will be good for you to do, and then do it every day. Meditation is a good choice, but there are others - like a gratitude journal, volunteering, yoga, prayer, and more. The okay thing you will do regularly is way better than the great thing you give up on.

<p>
Some folks say that you should give spiritual practices a shot even if you don't believe they're "really real." Something like "pray even if you don't think anyone is listening." In my case, a few years back, I was convinced that rituals and spiritual practices were a useful way to get in touch with the archetypes of the unconscious, but I thought it was "all in my head." It seems that this works for some folks (see this <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html">post</a> from Eric S. Raymond for one example). So I tried it out - I called on Gods, did rituals, and so forth, but all while believing their "reality" was something wholly metaphorical. I felt silly. I couldn't get past feeling like I was talking to myself, so even though I kept at it for a while, it never stopped feeling like an empty waste of time. All of this is to say, if you can't get yourself to at least thinking "maybe there's somebody/something else out there," you might not have much luck with more explicitly religious practices like prayer, and maybe you should start with something else, like meditation.

As I've stressed above, any grappling with spiritual matters you do will be deeply your own, and thus what works for you won't be what works for others.

<h4 id="org98b4bc7">Existentialism Says to Make Your Own Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org98b4bc7">
<p>
I've listed existentialism first, as it begins with a presupposition wholly in keeping with modern materialism: nothing is meaningful <i>in and of itself</i>. Instead, it is up to you to work out what is meaningful to you and why that matters. It can be a harsh pill to swallow, and it's one that I have since found doesn't meet my own spiritual needs, but existential thinkers tend to approach the problems with meaning with brutal clarity and how to tackle them with admirable courage. The single best work here has got to be <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> by Viktor Frankl. Nothing quite like a holocaust survivor's tale to put life's problems in perspective.

<h4 id="org90b7ecb">Self-Help Shows You How to Get Things Done</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org90b7ecb">
<p>
I spent years <i>very</i> into self-help stuff, mostly stuff by Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, Mark Manson, and so forth. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of helpful ways of dealing with stress, staying healthy, and being productive. Even so, you might say that I wouldn't even be writing this post if I had found the meaning I was looking for in this field. Most self-help seeks to appeal to a wide audience, and so takes few stands on deeper matters of meaning, instead either holding itself to smaller, more pragmatic things ("get in shape!" or "manage your finances!") or else grounds out in vague, woo-woo stuff of the "do what feels right to you!" kind.
</p>

<p>
The other big flaw in a lot of self-help is that it's mostly about solving problems. Don't get me wrong, solving problems is great, but it's not always the right way to come at things. Is grief that your mother died a "problem" to be solved? If every Sunday night you have a gnawing sense of dread, does that mean you should learn the best strategy for getting a promotion, or might it be a token of something deeper? All that being said, I think <i>The War of Art</i> by Steven Pressfield is very worthwhile, and Tim Ferriss's work is still top notch for learning how to get real world stuff done.

<h4 id="org9325b12">Stoic Philosophy Tells You to Take the Reins of Your Feelings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9325b12">
<p>
Unlike Existentialism, Stoic philosophy still pulls a lot of weight in my outlook. It is often pitched as fully in keeping with materialist belief, which it largely is, due to one of its main teachings: you can't control what happens in the world around you, but you can control how you think about it. Put enough work into steering how you <i>think</i> about what happens to you, and you can begin steering how you <i>feel</i> about things. Already, that's pretty worthwhile, and nothing about it goes against a materialist outlook.
</p>

<p>
The other main teaching of the stoics follows from this and is a bit harder to square with materialism, but you can if you wrangle it hard enough: since you can not control the world around you, no outside measures of "a good life" can withstand everything that might happen. Instead, you should steer your thoughts (and feelings) by "virtue". The reason this is harder for a materialist is that it turns out it's <i>really</i> hard, maybe even impossible, to come up with a truly bullet proof definition of "virtue" on purely empirical grounds. You can certainly get to good enough for living your life, but if you're looking for epistemic certainty, it can leave some gnawing doubts. The classical stoics didn't have this problem, because they believed virtue came from a universal divine source.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get started with Stoic philosophy, there are two good options: 1. <i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius and 2. <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> by Seneca. <i>Meditations</i> was the personal diary of a thoughtful and disciplined man, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> was the avuncular advice of a successful mentor helping a younger friend work out his life. You can't really go wrong with either, but <i>Meditations</i> comes off more like maxims and helpful self-talk, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> is more conversational and more understanding of the occasional misstep. Pick whichever of those grabs you more.

<h4 id="org97db2b1">Meaningness Explores the Ambiguity of "Meaning"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org97db2b1">
<p>
This is an online "<a href="https://meaningness.com">book</a>" that tries to tackle the problem of meaning, meaninglessness, and everything in between from a materialist-friendly Buddhist stand point. I think he does about as good a job as you possibly can if you take materialism as a key assumption. The heart of his argument is that most religious approaches put <i>too much</i> meaning on every damn thing, whereas nihilism puts <i>too little</i> meaning on stuff that everyone sees as meaningful unless you stop and think too hard about it. Instead, his take is that "meaning" is something rather ambiguous that all humans experience, partly by creating it and partly by responding to things in the outside world. Thorough, well-argued, and helpfully nuanced, maybe the best thing this book does is to make a telling, materialist-compatible case that nihilism is dumb and rationalism isn't an unassailable metaphysical/epistemological truth.

An adjacent couple of sets of writing I have found helpful is <a href="https://samzdat.com/">sam[]zdat</a> by Lou Keep and <a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/">Hotel Concierge</a>. These blogs begin with the same intellectual and cultural starting places as the wider "Rationalist" community, but wrestle much more with how far scientific evidence and logical reasoning can go when it comes to values and with the sometimes bad outcomes of reasonable courses of action with good intentions. Sadly, neither has posted in a long time.

<h4 id="org3265bd7">Religion Might Take You Some Places You Didn't Know About</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3265bd7">
<p>
Or, maybe you've come a bit farther than I've been thinking, and you're at least open to the thought that all of this "spiritual" stuff is not <i>only</i> metaphorical, not <i>just</i> a pithy way to sum up thorny psychological, sociological, and cultural factors, but instead there might be <i>something</i> outside of yourself that you'd be better off coming to know. Given who I reckon is reading this, it's fairly likely that when I say "religion," what comes to mind is something that looks a lot like Protestant Christianity - either in its Fundamentalist Evangelical flavor or its Progressive Social Justice flavor. Either that, or some kind of westernized Buddhism, as I have heard humorously, but not wrongly, called "Richard Gere Buddhism". Notwithstanding my less-than-kind likenesses, if any of that grabs you, by all means, go forth and delve into that thing!
</p>

<p>
For this post, though, I'm not going to say much on these, since I think you likely wouldn't be here if the ready-to-hand religious options did much for you. Instead, I'd like to draw your awareness to some <i>very</i> unalike choices. You see, religion of some kind is found amongst the folks of all lands, but between those lands, there are wildly unalike ways to deal with the spiritual world, many of which you might not have given much thought to. Here's a handful:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does Christianity hold some weight with you, but the kinds you know don't work for you? Consider poking around "Tradcath" (Traditional Catholic) or Orthodox Christianity. C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton are some worthwhile writers here, and there are loads of writings, podcasts, and so forth to check out online, but it's not a field I've looked deeply into, so I don't know which to steer you toward.</li>
<li>What if you can't get the claims of monotheism to make sense? The afore-said <i>World Full of Gods</i> does a wonderful job of spelling out why polytheism is worth taking earnestly, but if you'd like to give it a try yourself, check out <a href="https://kayeofswords.github.io/soulsinnerstatues/index.html">The Soul's Inner Statues</a> and pair with whatever mythology most speaks to you.</li>
<li>India and Japan have thriving home-grown religions in the shape of Hinduism and Shintoism/Buddhism (they often run together in Japan). Both have a very wide set of practices, prayers, rituals, and so forth, most of which are deeply linked with the neighborhoods from which they spring - so much so that you likely need to go and see them in the flesh to fully get them, but if something grabs you from afar, why not at least read about it?</li>
<li>Or how about the religious thinking and folkways of the sundry indigenous folks around the world? <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr. is a great starter for Native American Indian spirituality, and <i>Sand Talk</i> by Tyson Yunkaporta is one for Australian aboriginal people.</li>
<li>If you're <i>really</i> quirky, you might think about looking into some of the West's alternative spiritual paths of the last few hundred years - Theosophy, Occultism, the Druidry Revival, and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've shared all of the above since I think a lot of folks feel like their lives are lacking spiritually, but the [options] they know about leave them cold. If neither megachurch Christianity nor Yoga-studio Buddhism do it for you, it turns out there's a <i>lot</i> more out there, some of which just might grab you.

<h3 id="org410c518">Heed Your Own Experience</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org410c518">
<p>
Whatever you find on your spiritual journey, remember that it is <i>your</i> journey. If religious or spiritual practices aren't working for you, then hey, they're not what you need right here and right now. On the other hand, if you find them worthwhile, don't let the fact that they seem weird or don't make sense to other people stop you from doing what works for you. It's hard enough to deal with your own doubts and those of your friends and kin if you find yourself drawn to Christianity or Buddhism or other widely-practiced religions, but it's even tougher if you find yourself drawn to something more out there. Praying to multiple Gods? Lighting incense? Putting on funny robes and walking around in circles? You might find yourself feeling a bit self-conscious, or worse. Whatever you do, the whole point of spiritual practice is to make better sense of yourself and your experience, and to enrich your life, so pay attention to how your practice makes you feel and what impact it has on your life, and don't let any hangups get in the way of that.
</p>

<p>
It might turn out to be a long, weird ride, but it's worth it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rules_of_germanish_meter">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-November-20
</p>

<p>
I'm writing this post as much as a reference for me and as a place to point to whenever I make use of traditional Germanish metrical forms as anything else. For all of this, I am greatly indebted to Eirik Westcoat who has written a great deal of poetry in modern English using these forms for Heathen religious purposes, and lays out the rules very clearly in his book <i>Viking Poetry for Heathen Rites</i>. Note that this post has nothing to say about the other great thread in Germanish poetic tradition, which is the use of formal, stylized metaphors known as <i>kennings</i>, like the "whale road" for the sea or "flame of battle" for a sword.

<h3 id="org1cdc56d">Rules Common to All Germanish Meters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cdc56d">
<p>
Once you start learning the meters given below, it becomes clear that they are all variations on a theme. That "theme" was likely an ancestral form of poetry practiced by the speakers of Proto-Germanic that speakers of all of the Germanish languages took with them and changed over time. The most complex forms are all from Old Norse, which retained an unbroken native language poetic tradition until the latest time. I find it easier to remember a few key "lego pieces" that all of the meters are made of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alliteration and syllable counts are the main focus of Germanish meters - other poetic considerations like rhyming, placement of stress, and so forth are sometimes found, but distinctly secondary in importance</li>
<li>Only stressed syllables are counted for alliteration. In today's English, this is <i>usually</i> the first syllable, but not always, and it can be helpful to consult a dictionary, where stress is usually indicated with a "`" or similar symbol before the stressed syllable. Prefixes, like on-, be-, up-, un-, and so forth are often <i>not</i> stressed.</li>
<li>Note that the above allows a lot of flexibility in stress placement, compared to Latin and Greek poetic forms, but you do still get some interesting rhythm from following the rules given below</li>
<li>Consonant clusters that are pronounced as a single sound (th, ch, sk, sp, and so forth) alliterate with each other, rather than with the initial letter used in spelling. For example, "spelling" does not alliterate with "see", but does alliterate with "speak".</li>
<li>All vowels alliterate with each other (or "assonate" with each other if you want to be picky)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="orgc30b907">Rules for Fornyrdhislag - "Old Song Meter"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc30b907">
<p>
This was one of the most common verse forms in Old Norse, and given its similarity to attested Anglo-Saxon and continental Germanish verse forms, it's likely pretty close to the Proto-Germanic kind of poetry from which all of these kinds sprang. Most of the other verse forms can be told of as changes to this one.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Usually written in eight-line stanzas</li>
<li>The main unit of composition is the short line/half line, which must have 2 stressed syllables and usually has 4+ total syllables</li>
<li>The alliteration is between pairs of these short lines (A and B), where the <b>first</b> stressed syllable of the second short line (B1) alliterates with <b>either or both</b> of the first or second stressed syllable of the first short line (A1 or A2)</li>
<li>The second stressed syllable of the second short line (B2) <b>must not</b> alliterate with the first stressed syllable in that short line (B1), but it <i>may</i> optionally alliterate with either of the stressed syllables in the first short line (A1 OR A2). Due to the above rule, this means that if B2 alliterates, it may only alliterate with whichever A syllable B1 <b>does not</b> alliterate with</li>

So far, this is the meter I have the most experience with, as it is fairly straightforward and bendsome, as well as coming from the same background as the Gods and Lore that I draw on the most. Almost the same as Fornyrdhislag, but with these changes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Usually, two "half lines" are written/printed together to form the single "long line" of the verse name. These follow the same alliteration rules as the pairs of short lines in fornyrdhislag</li>
<li>Half lines <i>must</i> have 4+ syllables each</li>
<li>Write as many lines as needed to tell what you're trying to say - they are not broken into stanzas</li>

<h2 id="why_a_heathen_rosary" class="Post">Why a Heathen Rosary?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-25
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned last time, I thought I had put forth what I was up to coming up with a "Heathen Rosary", but it turns out I hadn't, so I thought "why not now?"
</p>

<p>
First off, it might be helpful to say what I mean by a "Heathen Rosary", since that could mean rather a few unalike things. In <i>Pagan Prayer Beads</i> by John Michael Greer and 'Clare Vaughn' (his wife's pen name for this work), they use "rosary" for any set of prayers tied to a set of prayer beads. Galina Krasskova <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/05/retooling-the-rosary/">"retooled" the rosary</a> with a set of prayers meant to be said on a set of beads made for the Christian Rosary and with the intent of keeping much of the rhythm of the Christian prayer, because she grew up around it and it was a foundational part of her early exposure to religious practice. My own take is somewhere in between these. I have never been Catholic, and the Rosary has never been a part of my spiritual practice. That being said, through prayer, meditation, and divination, I got the impression that I ought to come up with a prayer that takes advantage of much of what works well for the Christian Rosary, while still being customized for my own beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I got the idea I ought to work out a prayer that is "like the rosary", and to make that happen, I decided I ought to learn more about the Christian Rosary. As such, I've been reading through the prayers of Rosary and some works about it. From this reading, the thing that has struck me most strongly is the Rosary's alternation between familiarity/repetition and novelty. Also, the Christian Rosary has a strong alternation of praying to the masculine and feminine aspects of the Catholic religion. So, I've been trying to work out how to get the best of these traits in a regular prayer without calling upon Christian religious figures.
</p>

<p>
So, what I've come to is the <a href="#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Framework for a Heathen Rosary</a>. I'm still working out what the saying of intent and closing of each "group" of "Hail Iduns" should be, along with what the equivalent of the mysteries might be. My end goal is to have a set of prayers that share the Christian Rosary's balance between repetition and novelty, depth of theological ground covered, and alternation between masculine and feminine holy Beings, but that are said to the Gods and Goddesses I worship. On the contemplation side, I think that I will use Germanic myths, one myth in place of each "mystery", but I don't yet know how to group them. Divination has led me to make my beads with four sets of nine, and the main thread tying together the prayers, myth, and symbolism is the World Tree, Yggdrasil, but I'm still not entirely sure how to put all of that together. I'm also not sure how many groups of myths/mysteries to have, but I'm thinking maybe one for each of the Wyrds, or one for each day of the week, or one for each of the nine worlds, or something. I might have to start grouping myths together into groups of four and see how many meaningful categories I can infer.
</p>

<p>
Once I'm through all of this, I'd like to have a set of prayers I can say daily with associated contemplative material that will stand as a fairly compact, but also fairly complete, devotional practice. I'll share more here as I actually work it out!
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-18
</p>

<p>
I started writing this post thinking that I had already introduced my goal of coming up with a "Heathen Rosary," but looking back, it seems I only briefly mentioned it in my <a href="#the_hail_idun_prayer">"Hail Idun"</a> post. So here's the short version: the Rosary is a longstanding contemplative prayer that has been spiritually valuable to a lot of folks all around the world and for a very long time. As such, it seems like a good model for coming up with a contemplative prayer in keeping with my own beliefs. Through prayer, meditation, and just plain thinking about it, I've come to a rough idea of what that prayer might look like, but I've still got a lot of work to do.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to be further along in working this set of prayers out by this point, but since I'm not, I thought I'd share what I do have so far. I haven't written out any of the prayers other than the "Hail Idun" Prayer, but I've gotten some idea of the shape those prayers will take.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A Saying of Intent</li>
<li>Open each group of prayers with a prayer to Woden</li>
<li>Say Nine "Hail Iduns"</li>
<li>Close each group with a prayer that again affirms relatedness with the beings of the world</li>
<li>Repeat for four groups</li>
<li>Close with another saying of striving to live well</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you know the Christian Rosary, this pretty closely follows the framework there. That collection of prayers opens with the Apostle's Creed, has 5 groups of prayers (Decades), each of which begins with an "Our Father" and is made up of 10 repetitions of the "Hail Mary", and closes with a "Glory Be." At the end of the whole prayer is a closing prayer. The big difference in my group of prayers, other than praying to different spiritual beings, is that the opening and closing are less statements of <i>belief</i>, and more a statement of <i>intent</i>. For Christianity, stating what you believe to be true about the world is an important foundation of religious practice. Germanish religion, on the other hand, like most many-Godded beliefs, puts far more weight on what you <i>do</i> and how you relate to the Gods. As such, rather than a "creed", I plan to open with a statement of intention to live well and do right by the Gods, and for the closing prayer to reiterate this idea.
</p>

<p>
Having nine "Hail Iduns" was a pretty obvious choice, given the prominence of 9 as a holy number in Germanish belief, but it was harder to figure out how many groups of prayers to say. I've come down on four groups for now, mostly because it is pretty close to the 5 groups of the Christian Rosary, but there are more instances of "fours" in Germanish myth than "fives". I haven't yet worked out how many groups of themes for contemplation (the "Mysteries" in the Christian tradition) to use, but I'm leaning toward using myths as the themes, and possibly grouping into three groups, such as the "Wyrd Mysteries, Werthende Mysteries, and the Schuld Mysteries."
</p>

<p>
Another element that I think is quietly implicit in the Christian Rosary but that I intend to emphasize pretty heavily is the alternation between prayers to a masculine power and to a feminine power. In Christianity, that's Jesus and Mary, and for me, that will mainly be Woden and Idun. I think that this interplay of masculine and feminine is essential to how this particular set of prayers works, but it might also be influenced by Christianity being otherwise so heavily oriented toward the masculine. The other complicating factor is that the Christian theological world is comparatively simple compared to most polytheistic understandings of the world - you cover pretty much all of your theological bases by affirming the Trinity and then praying to God the Father in the way Jesus taught, and by affirming Jesus's role even in the prayers to Mary.
</p>

<p>
For a polytheist, getting the same sense of praying to "everything overall" is much harder (and perhaps not needed?). In my case, I am seeing the unifying factor as the Tree of Life, Yggdrassil, and the relationships between the Gods, spirits, and other beings that it represents as what to call upon for "the whole holy world". I might also bring the Wyrds (Norns) into either the replacement for the "Glory Be" and/or the closing prayer. While specific divine beings, they are also embodiments of the workings of the universe and are connected with the Tree.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm planning on writing prayers for each of these pieces following a traditional Germanish meter (likely "Anglo-Saxon Long Lines"), and I'll share them here as I get them written. As always, any thoughts or feedback are welcome.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-looking_into_the_our_father">

<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-21
</p>

<p>
After my <a href="#lessons_learned_on_prayer_from_the_council_of_trent">earlier post</a> on the Catechism of the Council of Trent about the section "On Prayer", I went ahead and read through the rest of the section, which is a line-by-line treatment of the "Our Father". The catechism uses this prayer as an example of a single, sufficient prayer for Christian practice. While I am not a Christian, I find the thought of having one prayer that is a wholly sufficient baseline an especially interesting one, and I thought that it would be helpful to look in detail at what the Council of Trent had to say about the "Our Father". 
</p>

<p>
Since I'm not a Christian, my main interest is in thinking through what crafting such a prayer for another faith might mean. Of course, I'm especially interested in coming up with such a prayer for my own faith, but to try to make this helpful for others, I'd like to generalize as much as possible.  Lastly, though much of the prayer is particularly Christian, there is much within the prayer that is inspiring and beautiful for any spiritual path, and might be worth thinking through how to emulate in other faiths, and I'd like to highlight that as well.
</p>

<h3 id="org6922a99">The Progression of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6922a99">
<p>
The Council of Trent broke down the prayer line-by-line and talked about what each line meant on its own, but also as a logical progression. The heart of it seems to be that you start universal, end universal, and have more particular asks sandwiched in-between. Each thing asked for also works both as a "plain" request for something obvious, and as a more sophisticated spiritual statement.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="org918737d">Our Father, Who Art in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org918737d">
<p>
The prayer begins by calling upon a loving father, not a harsh or distant lord. By specifying "our" father, the prayer also acknowledges that all men are brothers, and God is the father of all. Since Christians believe God to be everywhere, "Who art in Heaven" at first doesn't make much sense, but it serves to draw attention to the noblest part of visible nature, the sky, and asks those praying to compare that with God. More personally, by placing the highly personal figure of a "father" in the highly spiritual locale of "heaven", the prayer immediately establishes a link between personal practice and the transcendental goods sought through spiritual practice.

<h4 id="org975d7a3">Hallowed Be Thy Name</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org975d7a3">
<p>
The Council of Trent recognizes that God's name can be nothing but hallowed in an abstract sense, but instead frames this bit of the prayer as a recognition, and a plea by the one praying to treat the name of God as holy. More subtly, the Council argues that all things that are good and hallowed are encompassed by God's name, and that this part of the prayer recognizes that. It also serves as a reminder to those praying to try to bring holiness to God's name through their actions outside of prayer, which will serve as an encouragement to any folks whose belief might be wavering.

<h4 id="org7e7c04e">Thy Kingdom Come</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7e7c04e">
<p>
The Council of Trent puts this forward as the highest possible good and says that it holds all other goods that might possibly be asked for - anything that might be truly good is actually a part of the Kingdom of God, and anything not a part of the Kingdom of God only seems good, but isn't truly so. This part of the prayer is meant to remind believers to notice how much better the goods of the Kingdom of Heaven are than the goods of this world, but also as an encouragement to bring as much of the Kingdom of God into the world as possible.

<h4 id="orgb1af48e">Thy Will Be Done</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb1af48e">
<p>
This is one that is seemingly at first the most strongly associated with purely Christian theology, yet that maybe has useful lessons for other faiths as well. The core idea is that the one praying ought to acknowledge that what he thinks he wants might actually not be such a great idea, and instead that he should gladly accept what the God prayed to believes to be best. Christians justify this position with original sin - because you are fundamentally flawed and cut off from the Divine, whatever you will to happen is tainted, and so you should instead seek the will of the higher power, who is untainted. Even without original sin, though, you can pretty readily get to the idea that what we think is best might not have all the needed information. The world is a big, complicated place, and we are just some moderately clever social apes - why on earth would we think that we know what's best for us? If you believe in the idea of a God or Gods at all, you should trust that they know a bit better than we do, from our highly limited material points of view.

<h4 id="orgd97e024">On Earth as It Is in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd97e024">
<p>
This bit was especially interesting to me, as I learned something I hadn't ever considered before: the Council of Trent says that "On Earth as It Is in Heaven" applies equally to "Hallowed be Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," and "Thy will be done." I had always only read it as an extension of "Thy will be done" and nothing else. On the one hand, this clause acknowledges the contrast between that which is spiritual and that which is worldly, but on the other, it also works as a thanksgiving, to the degree that God's name is hallowed, His kingdom has come, and His will is done in this world. More broadly, it acknowledges the perfection of Heaven and the lack of perfection in the material world and expresses longing for the material world becoming more like the perfect spiritual world.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org61e7738" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org61e7738">Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org61e7738">
<p>
Here we at last come to the asking for day-to-day, bodily things. One of the points the Council of Trent makes is exactly that the asking for bodily things comes only after asking for the highest and most spiritual things. I also appreciate the amount of meaning they find in the few words in this line. Asking for "our" daily bread acknowledges that you have to work, but you also rely on God's help for anything good that comes into your life. Asking for "daily" bread acknowledges that you're asking for what you need everyday - necessities, not luxuries. "This day" acknowledges that what you had yesterday might not come automatically today - you can't take these things for granted and should keep on being thankful so long as you have what you need. Lastly, "Give us" rather than "give me" encourages the one praying to think not only of himself, but of the needs of all of his fellow men.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not Christian, this is an impressive amount of religious meaning to pack into one line! I think it's maybe significant that we're really getting to the richest lines of the prayer when we turn from asking for high-level spiritual goods to normal, earthly needs.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcfb919f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcfb919f">Forgive Us Our Trespasses as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfb919f">
<p>
This might be considered the heart of the Christian belief system, and might be the part of the prayer least easily adapted to other beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I think that forgiveness is an important part of many religious beliefs, but in Christianity, it is <i>the</i> belief, and so the line in the most common Christian prayer that most directly deals with forgiveness deserves a bit of attention. Once again, the plural subject ("forgive <b>us our</b> trespasses as <b>we</b> forgive those who trespass against <b>us</b>") does a lot of heavy lifting - this is not only asking for help with one's own forgiveness, but for all of mankind to get better at this very hard skill. Like other parts of the prayer, this one acknowledges the work done by both the one praying and God, in partnership. Lastly, one thought I found especially helpful from the Catechism was that folks might avoid saying the whole prayer, or at least this bit, if they had folks they couldn't yet forgive. In other words, if someone had someone against whom they were still nursing a grudge, they might hold off saying the "Our Father", or at least the line about forgiving trespasses. The Council of Trent very strongly came down on the belief that this was a mistake. More broadly, I think the idea that we ought to pray for the things we <i>wish</i> were true about us, even if we currently fall short, is a useful one.

<div id="outline-container-orgb6f932a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb6f932a">And Lead Us Not Into Temptation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb6f932a">
<p>
This is another bit where the Council of Trent makes some rather Christian assumptions - that "temptation" is something the Devil does and that is an unquestionable feature of existence. That being said, I think anyone who has been alive past childhood has experienced the draw of thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors that some part of them more readily dismisses. What I thought was most helpful in the Council of Trent's analysis was the notion that temptation is an intrinsic part of being alive, and so no amount of prayer will get you to a life "without temptation" - instead, the goal is no more temptation than you can handle with God's help. This seems both a. much  more do-able, and b. more consistent with other theological interpretations. For example, Christian theology might have it that making love to a bunch of strangers is lustful and therefore bad. On the other hand, if you belong to a belief that has looser beliefs about sex, you might still believe that having sex with strangers might be bad if a. you've pledged yourself to someone else, or b. it gets in the way of forming a more serious relationship with one person. In this case, the "temptation" to have sex with multiple new folks might still be very strong, but the Christian and non-Christian beliefs about why it should be avoided would be different, even if they came up with the same recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I appreciate the reminder that this part of the prayer is useful both for dealing with "avoiding temptation" in the abstract, or in general, and also in the moment to resist specific temptations. Whatever negative stuff you want to avoid, you should likely pray for daily, as well as whenever you find yourself needing help in the moment.

<div id="outline-container-orgb523631" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb523631">But Deliver Us From Evil</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb523631">
<p>
Much as "Thy Kingdom Come" holds all of the good you might ask for in any prayer, so "deliver us from evil" holds the wish to have everything not good taken away. In some sense, everything asked for above is held within this - as all of the good things asked for are, in fact, the lack of evil. One nice thing about this bit of the prayer is that folks tend to pray to get rid of what's wrong anyway, even if not especially religious ("no atheists in foxholes" and so forth). All that being said, this bit of the prayer is at the end, because asking for spiritual goods is more important overall. Also, some seeming "evils" might actually be good for our souls. Lastly, this says "from <b>Evil</b>", rather than "from <b>evils</b>", as Christianity sees all evil as coming from one source (the devil), and acknowledges that some material circumstances might seem evil, while actually being good for you - this way of praying allows for experiencing things that seem crappy in the moment, but might be for the best in the long run.

<div id="outline-container-orgaf2aa10" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgaf2aa10">Amen</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaf2aa10">
<p>
The prayer ends with a word rich with weight from scripture. Most importantly, "amen" works as a "seal" to mark the prayer as done, but with a feeling of gladness. In Catholic ceremonies, the congregation does not say "amen", but instead the priest says "amen" back to them, which they treat as a sign that the prayer has been heard and will be acted upon. According to the Council, even when praying alone, "amen" can work as a glad celebration of coming closer to God, a reminder of what the prayer just finished was truly for.

<div id="outline-container-orge04fd65" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge04fd65">The Theology of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge04fd65">
<p>
Now, one thing I kept running into while reading the Council's analysis was that their arguments were cogent, coherent, and self-consistent - <i>if you accept Christian theology</i>. If your beliefs differ, it's a bit less helpful. Even so, I think that identifying the main strands of theological belief will be helpful in coming up with what others might get out of an analysis of the "Our Father".
</p>

<p>
First off, the prayer is assumed to be directed to the single source of all goodness, God. If you are coming from a non-monotheistic standpoint, you might see the value in having a single source of all goodness, but you might not attribute it to a single "God". Regardless of what this source of all goodness is, the prayer opens by addressing it joyfully, follows up by wishing for it to be realized in the world as much as possible, and then acknowledges that all day-to-day material goods also come from this source of all goodness, and closes by acknowledging that we all fall short of what we would like, and asking for help in doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, since this is, in fact, a Christian prayer, we have to deal with concept of original sin. Original sin is implicit in much of the prayer, and explored in more depth by the Council's analysis. The entire prayer basically assumes that the one praying is in a fallen state and needs redemption, and that this prayer is one of the chief tools in seeking and achieving that end. Obviously this comes out most clearly in the lines about forgiving trespasses, leading not into temptation, and delivering from evil. As I'll get into below, this strikes me as likely one of the biggest theological differences another faith would have to work around if looking for inspiration from this prayer. Related to this is the single source of all Evil mentioned above, which has a certain tidiness to it, but again, doesn't jive with everyone's view of the world.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, much of the prayer expects those praying to do their share of the work, which I find quite interesting, and likely useful to apply outside of a Christian context. Though God is acknowledged as all powerful and the author of all good things, at least according to the Council of Trent, the one praying still has to do work and pray and believe and otherwise live consistently with what's being asked for, rather than just sitting back and waiting for God to handle everything. That might be the element of the Council's analysis that I found most interesting - it consistently stressed the active, engaged role folks need to take to get the most of prayer specifically and their spiritual life more broadly.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78f6898" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78f6898">What Can We Learn for Other Faiths?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78f6898">
<p>
Despite the challenges of generalizing from a strongly Christian starting point, I think that there are some helpful lessons for crafting prayers for other faiths. Structurally speaking, I rather like the progression of the "Our Father" - as mentioned above, it begins by naming to Whom the prayer is addressed, asks for/affirms faith in the highest good things that Being can give, goes into more earthly requests, and closes with another universal, but this time "flipped" (deliver us from Evil rather than grant us the Kingdom of Heaven). So, I think that following the structure for prayers in other faiths would not present too much of a challenge, and could even be followed pretty closely, if wanted, by substituting in things appropriate to the Being prayed to. My <a href="#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of Fallhall's Prayer</a> is pretty close to that.
</p>

<p>
What gives a bit more of a challenge is looking at the prayer's theology and thinking through how to craft a prayer that fulfills a <i>functional</i> role similar to what the "Our Father" does for Christianity, even if it's actual structure is different - ideally, one that also functions as a "single, sufficient prayer" for a different system of belief. Drawing on the theological threads we stepped through above, the three core things we identified the prayer doing functionally are 1. acknowledging/celebrating the source of all Goodness, 2. seeking redemption as a sinful being in a fallen world, and 3. calling upon the one praying to show his faith and belief by living a life consistent with what is asked for in the prayer. 
</p>

<p>
These are highly specific to the Christian faith, and if we want to write a prayer for another faith, we'll have to express some different things. So, I've taken the three threads above and generalized them further: 1. is either the highest good, its source, or both, 2. is whatever this faith most seeks, what "problem it solves", and 3. is an affirmation to live consistent with your beliefs. For example, for Druidry, 1. might be the concept Awen, 2. might be knowledge, power, and peace, and 3. might be asking to live in harmony with nature. This might be harder for religions that don't have something as clear cut that they seek as Christianity is about seeking forgiveness for sins, or a more multi-faceted concept about what the highest good is or where it comes from.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I haven't worked out a prayer for my own beliefs following these recommendations yet, but I am glad I went through this exercise, I think it's been a helpful step, and I look forward to coming up with something.

<h2 id="the_hail_idun_prayer" class="Post">The "Hail Idun" Prayer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_hail_idun_prayer">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-14
</p>

<p>
Keeping on with taking Christian prayers and writing a Heathen prayer as close to their shapes as I can, I've taken the "Hail Mary" and written the "Hail Idun". Idun is very important to me and my spiritual practice, and I think it likely that once I get to my goal of a full "Heathen Rosary", some kind of "Hail Idun" (whether this, or in Germanic metre or something else) will likely be the heart of the practice.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org75b12fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org75b12fd">Hail Idun</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75b12fd">

<p>
Hail Idun<br />
Full of love<br />
Brego* is with Thee.<br />

<p>
<i>*Brego is possibly an Old English form of Bragi, God of Poetry and Idun's husband, who may or may not be a hypostasis of Odin/Woden. I picked it because it sounded better than "Bragi" to me.
**Wen is one take on the plural of *Wan, the hypothetical Old English form of the Old Norse Vanr, Vanir. Others suggest "Wanes", though there's no direct textual evidence for the word either way in Old English, and some folks question whether the Anglo-Saxons believed in the same two tribes of Gods as the Old Norse did.</i>

<p>
After asking for some resources on prayer on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/190418.html?thread=32258258#cmt32258258">past Magic Monday</a>, samchevre pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_catechism_of_the_Council_of_Trent/Part_4">The Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>. Sure enough, despite its explicit Catholic Christian focus, I found a lot of good thinking on prayer as a practice, and I'd like to share what I thought were the most helpful takeaways for folks of any faith.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc38af56" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc38af56">1. Kinds of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc38af56">
<p>
<b>Asking for Things</b>: Maybe the most common kind of prayer, the Council of Trent held that it was right and proper to ask God in prayer for anything it was right for folks to have. While it is certainly possible to ask for the wrong kind of things in prayer, and it takes some practice to ask for the right kind of things (more on both below), the evidence we have from just about every spiritual tradition that has recorded prayers shows folks asking the Gods for things that they want. If done right, this is not just a "gimme, gimme!" or a business transaction, but instead a way of acknowledging that you can't do <i>anything</i> in the world without your wider context and the help of the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thanksgiving</b>: Even if you are uncomfortable with asking for things in prayer, I think it's hard, if not impossible, to find anything wrong with prayers of thanksgiving. Even materialists <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-happiness-research/">acknowledge how worthwhile being consciously thankful is</a>. Even more so than asking for things in prayer, giving thanks for what you have in this life is a good way to acknowledge that you are dependent on wider and higher things.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf430ee4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf430ee4">2. Outcomes of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf430ee4">
<p>
<b>Bringing You Closer to the Holy</b>: I think the biggest thing prayer does for you is to bring you closer to the Holy and open you up to its influence. However you pray, it's a way to take some time to think about and reach out to whatever you think of as Holy, and hopefully to listen for some kind of answer. Many spiritual practices can do this, but prayer has the strengths of being ready to do whenever and wherever you are, and being changeable to whatever your needs are right now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acknowledging Something Greater than Yourself</b>: I talked about this in both kinds of prayer above, but most any kind of prayer leads you to acknowledge that you need the wider world and its God(s). Even for things you did "by yourself", you still have your parents, teachers, employers, and culture to thank, to say nothing of any Gods or Goddesses. While humility can go too far into abasing yourself or groveling, most of us can use a timely reminder that we are not an island and that the world has given us a great many gifts that we ought to be thankful for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Giving a Gift</b>: Prayer can also be a gift to the Gods, the same as incense or a candle or mead. The more care and thought you put into the prayer, and the better it is said, the better it works as such. This is the most helpful when you lack the means to give something else, but is still worthwhile even if you have all of the offerings you might wish for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Helping the Dead</b>: Most faiths believe that the dead can use some help in the afterlife, and that prayer is one way of offering that help. For Christians, you pray for souls in Purgatory, other faiths might pray for souls to learn the lessons of their past life as smoothly as they might so they can move on to another life, and so forth. Whatever you believe about the afterlife (well, I guess, unless you don't believe in one), it seems that prayer is helpful to those in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1cf2fd6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1cf2fd6">3. How to Pray</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cf2fd6">
<p>
<b>Prayer Works Best as a Habit</b>: The Catechism talks about prayer as a "duty", not something nice-to-have or optional. I don't know if that way of thinking is true for all faiths, but I think it is very much true that prayer works best as a habit, something you do at least every day. Much of the good of prayer only seems to come when you have done it for awhile with unalike things going on in your life. From what I have seen, it seems best to find many little ways to bring prayer into your life - something to say when you wake up, when you go to sleep, before you eat, when you put on a worn holy symbol, and so forth, as well as a "main" prayer set aside as its own thing. Of course, all of this doesn't have to be piled on at once, as that's not how good habit-building works, but over time, adding such things helps to make prayer a given, rather than something that takes will and forethought.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pray in the Right Frame of Mind with the Right Feeling</b>: For Christians, the Council of Trent recommends that Christians go into prayer with 1. utmost humility, 2. sorrow or regret for sins done, 3. a lack of unworthy feelings like wrath or pride, and 4. faith in God. Once praying, the prayer should be heartfelt, with the ideal being that you "pour out" what is in your heart and soul with great warmth. I feel like the strong weight put on humility and sinfulness may not fit with every other faith, but the heart of the thought, that you should put yourself in a frame of mind in keeping with what is best to your Gods and then pray earnestly and with true feeling, seems like a good one to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ask for the Right Things</b>: The Catechism gave what struck me as a remarkably good rede about asking for things in prayer. First, get in the habit of asking God(s) for all things that you want in your life. Second, practice only asking for things that bring you closer to God(s). This is a really good way to build habits - you start by harnessing your natural yearning to have stuff to get you to pray often. Hopefully, as you do this, you start thinking about and acknowledging the role of the Holy in bringing good things into your life. Having gotten used to thinking about God(s) shaping what comes into your life, you can more readily think about what kinds of things God(s) might most want you to do in the world, and you can start asking for that. Through this change, you learn to ask for the right things, which makes even your prayers asking for stuff into a way to come closer to the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Prayer Becoming a Way to Do Unworthy Things</b>: For all the good that prayer can and does do, it can also become hollow, or even worse, truly harmful. If you only say the words or go through the motions, not only won't you get much out of prayer, you might sour on it or even on the Holy. There's some place for "fake it till you make it" in any kind of habit building, but if prayer feels hollow for a long time, it's likely not doing you any good, and you might need to work out a new way of doing things. Still worse is if you let prayer become a tool for your pride - showing off, making a big fuss about how strong your belief is, or the like. The Council refers to Jesus's well-known rede to pray indoors, out of the public eye. I think there's a role for public prayer, but a good rule of thumb seems to be that if you <i>only</i> pray when others are watching, you're likely doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Lone Sufficient Prayer Can Be Helpful to Have</b>: The Catechism puts forth the "Our Father" as a wholly sufficient prayer by itself. In other words, as a Christian, if you only pray the Our Father, you're doing everything you need to do with prayer. Other prayers are helpful and do a lot of good, of course, but they say that you only really <i>need</i> this one prayer. I found this a highly interesting thought. I think it would be very helpful to look at your faith and ask yourself "if I could only say one prayer for the rest of this life, and I wanted to get at everything that is most important in my faith, what would that prayer be?" I think that most faiths likely don't have a ready-to-go answer the way Christianity does (perhaps the "Bond Among Druids" for Revival Druidry), but that writing it would be a worthy goal to strive for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some Hands-On Tips</b>: The Council also gave a handful of more hands-on tips that I thought were helpful: 1. "Mental Prayer" (praying without speaking out loud) not only works, but is often best suited to sharing strong, deep feelings. That being said, praying out loud helps you stay focused and can be a spur to feelings of devotion. 2. Food and drink can make it harder to have the right mindset or feeling for prayer, so it might be best to pray without having eaten or had drinks besides water for some time. Fasting can also bring on an even stronger feeling for prayer. 3. Try to make your deeds outside of prayer line up with what you ask for in prayer. If you ask for help, but give no help to others, you shouldn't think that will work out well for you.

<p>
This started out as at least half a joke, but as I worked through it, I was like "huh, maybe this isn't all bad". The Lord's Prayer is one of the few pieces of my lukewarm Christian upbringing that really stuck in my mind, and I've always appreciated its cadence, so I tried to keep that as much as possible here while making the concepts fitting for a prayer to Woden. That being said, I'm <i>really</i> new at this prayer/poetry thing, so I'm sure I'll look back at this in a bit and cringe.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Allfather, who art in Fallhall,<br />
Awesome be Thy name.<br />
Thy walkyries come, Thy will be done,<br />
On fields choosing the winners.<br />
Teach us this day our daily lore,<br />
And welcome us as wayfarers,<br />
As we welcome those who wayfare amongst us.<br />
Lead us not into shamefulness,<br />
And unshackle us from fetters.<br />
For Thine is the wisdom,<br />
and the greatness, and the lordship,<br />
As long as this age shall last.<br />

Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.
</p>

<p>
It is the thrown-out plastic water bottle in an otherwise spotless stream. It is the streaming comedy that rings brittle and hollow. It is the buzzing of a notification for a social media app. It is the sneering look of cynical contempt that curdles a young face.
</p>

<p>
Call it ennui. Call it anomie. Call it nihilism. Call it by whichever French philosophical word you like. It is an <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">Immoral Maze</a>. It is <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk</a>. It is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.
</p>

<p>
So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-destinations_and_journeys">

<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-22
</p>

<p>
The other day, I read <a href="https://open-space.dreamwidth.org/8001.html">this post</a> the other day by an online acquaintance, which reinforced the old-but-good maxim that it is not the destination that matters, but rather the journey. I agree with this, but in responding to the post, I had a few thoughts on it that I thought I'd get down and post here.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2cd3914" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cd3914">The Destination is not the <i>Goal</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cd3914">
<p>
So, you've likely heard some variation of this fortune-cookie-style wisdom before, that the journey is what matters, not where you're going. As I said above, I think this is mostly true and worth keeping in mind, since our psychology and society often push us into laser-focusing on the destination with remarkable tunnel vision. It's helpful to be reminded that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo">"life moves pretty fast - if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."</a> Also, every single successful person you ever talk to will tell you that the experience of achieving what they were after was nowhere near as engaging and interesting as the pursuit. Also, paradoxically, if you start out overly focused on outcomes and end points, you might just miss out on developing what you need to develop to even reach them at all. Often, focusing on the process instead of the goal is <i>how</i> you get to the goal at all. But notice in all of these examples, we're still talking about goals and destinations, they're still assumed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org862b6aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org862b6aa">Destinations are <i>Excuses</i> for Journeys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org862b6aa">
<p>
Okay, so journeys = good and destinations = bad, right? We should just stop setting goals or having specific places to go, right? Well, maybe not so much. There's a difference between a journey and wandering - the destination. So, we have a bit of a paradox. We want to value destinations less than journeys, but we need destinations to have journeys. What I realized in responding to my friend's post is that destinations are <i>excuses</i> for journeys - necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for what we're looking for. I keep having this insight over and over again playing with my daughter - I'll get frustrated that she's being slow to take her turn on Candy Land, or that she gets distracted by a stick while kicking her soccer ball into a goal. On my better days, though, I'll catch myself and realize "oh, right, achieving the 'goal' of this activity isn't actually why we're doing this, it's so that she can have fun and spend time with me and learn things". Another helpful example for me is playing games. Within the game itself, sure, you're playing to win, but you're <i>really</i> playing the game to have fun with your friends, so you likely shouldn't act like a dick to try to win. So how do we recognize that we need destinations so that we'll take journeys, while not attaching too much importance to them?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga49e706" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga49e706">How Do you Balance these?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga49e706">
<p>
I like to think about it as something similar to the advice to have "strong opinions, loosely held" that you'll run into in the startup world. It's helpful to have specific goals or destinations, maybe even ambitious ones, but not to focus on them so hard that you lose sight of what's around you on the way. One thing I think helps do this is to be suspicious of "efficiency", when that means "get to the outcome as fast as possible". Sure, sometimes efficiency is worthwhile, but only when it is compatible with whatever other goals or values the journey might be meant to support. If you purposely chose to take the scenic route for the sights and stops, it's foolish to speed once you get on it. If you asked your kid to help clean up so she learns to be helpful and responsible, then it's dumb to do things for her because she's slow about it. If you started a company to have freedom and autonomy, it's foolish to take a deal that puts you in someone else's pocket. So, to properly value the journey, we have to think about not where we're going, but why we chose that end point in the first place, and be ready to adjust along the way.

<h2 id="reading_goal_for_2022" class="Post">Reading Goal for 2022</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reading_goal_for_2022">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-05
</p>

<p>
This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:
</p>

<p>
<i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i>
</p>

<p>
I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?
</p>

<p>
A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="https://fs.blog/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/#2-the-lindy-effect">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.
</p>

<p>
So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

</p>

<p>
For now, I'm lucky enough to get to share my thoughts with students every semester. That being said, there's a lot of stuff that I think is really helpful that I can't justify sharing in my course, as it's not so much about "business" or "communication". So, I reckoned I'd gather up that kind of thing here. Mostly, it's stuff I wish I had known when I was younger, so it ought to be very helpful to young folks. On the other hand, I wasn't all that young when I learned a lot of this, so you might still find something helpful here even if you're not so young.
</p>

<p>
Given that this is the internet, and that I teach at a university, I feel like I have to say clearly that these are my own views, and not those of my employer. I've posted them here to help maintain some of that distance. If you see anything here that upsets you, I'd like to hear from you so we can talk it over, especially if you're one of my students.

<h4 id="org6df6d3d">Learn and Use Mental Models</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6df6d3d">
<p>
My good friend Jonathan introduced me to "mental models", which are perhaps best explained by the blog <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a>, but here's the short version: different fields have their own ways of thinking about the world, and many of these ways can be applied outside of their home field. Naming these ways of thinking as more-or-less contained "models" makes it easier to remember and apply them in a variety of situations. The other reason it's helpful to think of them as separate "models" is that it reminds you that they are just that: useful abstractions that help you understand the world, not the raw, objective truth.

<h4 id="org7734135">Learn How to Read a Book</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7734135">
<p>
Anyone who wants to read books for more than fun needs to read <i>How to Read a Book</i> by Adler and Van Doren. If you haven't read it, your education has a serious gap. They break down reading into four levels: 1. Elementary, 2. Inspectional, 3. Analytical, 4. Syntopic. 1. <i>Elementary reading</i> is what you learned in grade school: marks on a page form meaningful words - that's all most folks know how to do. 2. <i>Inspectional reading</i> could be called "intelligent skimming" - you shoot to get the most out of a book in a fixed amount of time. 3. <i>Analytical reading</i> is where things get interesting. This is when you want to get the most out of a book, <i>period</i>. You take all the time you need to grok it in fullness. 4. <i>Syntopic reading</i> is when you want to understand a concept or field of study and so you read a lot of works by different authors and make sense of them all together. Even if you don't follow the exact scheme of this book or the techniques it outlines, I think it is very useful to have an idea of different levels of reading depending on what you're trying to do, and to apply them intentionally.

<div id="outline-container-org24f31f5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org24f31f5">Use Divergence and Convergence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org24f31f5">
<p>
I was introduced to this pair of concepts by my former boss Tony, who learned them by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Basadur">Dr. Min Basadur</a> and becoming certified in his creative problem solving approach (which is currently called <a href="https://www.basadur.com/simplexity/">"Simplexity"</a>). In creative thinking, you have two processes which are both necessary, but are better done separately: "diverging" and "converging". <i>Diverging</i> is where you try to generate as many options as possible. <i>Convergence</i> is when you evaluate the options generated and try to pick the best ones based on whatever criteria is relevant. These two ways of thinking use very different mental processes, and they interfere with each other. This approach applies in a surprisingly broad number of fields: in writing, you want to write a crappy first draft and edit, if you're figuring out where to go to dinner with your friends, throw out any options you can think of without worrying about if any of them are 'good', and only <i>then</i> pick something from that list. So, any time you're trying to solve a problem, first come up with as many options as you can, pause, and then look at those options and ask which ones work. Repeat as needed.

<h4 id="org4374b81">Seek Out Old, Weird Things</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4374b81">
<p>
Don't waste your time trying to fit in. Not because fitting in isn't important - it is. But that shit will take care of itself. Even the weirdest, most against-the-grain bastard you can think of is still a product of his time and culture. So, unless you are already a hermit living deep in the woods, cultivate an interest in the obscure, the far off, and the long ago. Even though there are certain charms to eccentricity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYpsdBJlBcU">in and of itself</a>, that's not what I'm pushing here. In a big, highly-linked world, your best hope for being valuable is to bring a combination of talents and knowledge to the table that <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/navals-writing">no one else has</a>, not by doing what everyone around you is doing. The two best heuristics I know of for making this happen are to go after what is weird and what is old. When you start poking around weird/old things, you're going to run into a lot of mularkey, but this is actually a feature, not a bug - you get to practice evaluating sources and how they fit in with what else you know. If everything you encounter fits into a neat, coherent system without this work, you are missing or distorting large chunks of reality, because reality is messy. What do I mean by "weird"? Anything that would get a snooty look at a cocktail party is a good start - cryptids, UFOs, alternate versions of history, magic, conspiracies, and so forth. Am I saying you should <i>believe</i> all of this stuff? Of course not. The idea is to expose yourself to ways of thinking that are very different from what you'll usually encounter - sometimes, when used carefully, some of those ways of thinking are useful. And that leaves "old", this one is simpler - if it was written before you were born, chances are pretty good that it contains some ways of looking at the world that seem pretty alien to you, which again, is the point of the exercise.

<h4 id="org9017f75">Learn and Recognize the Three Economies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9017f75">
<p>
I encountered this model in John Michael Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition/9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</a>, which itself draws heavily on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E.F. Schumacher</a>. The book was helpful for a variety of reasons, but the best bit was a mental model (see above). Greer breaks down "the economy" into three separate economies that work very differently: the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Economies. I'll start in the middle with the most familiar: the <i>Secondary Economy</i> is the economy of goods and services. I cut up meat to sell to the baker and use the proceeds to buy the products of the candlestick maker. Economics as a field is very good at analyzing the Secondary Economy, but tends not to think much about the <i>Primary Economy</i>, which is everything the natural world does to allow human economic activity to happen at all. When a farmer buys seed and a tractor and works his tuchus off cultivating and harvesting his crops, that's all Secondary Economy work. The fact that plants evolved little starch pods called grain, that the microbes in the soil allow plants to grow in it, that bees pollinate the plants, and that the sun shines down free energy for photosynthesis is all the Primary Economy. Lastly, we have the <i>Tertiary Economy</i>, which is the economy of financial instruments like money, loans, and stocks. Theoretically, everything in the Tertiary Economy is a representation of something in the Primary or Secondary Economy: I have a piece of paper called a "Title" that says I own a chunk of land, but the bank has a piece of paper saying they get the land if I don't pay back the loan they gave me to buy the title, and so on. So long as the Tertiary Economy remains pretty lightly linked with the Primary and Secondary economies, it's incredibly useful - using money to settle transactions and measure wealth has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">lots of benefits</a>, and other financial instruments help to start bigger, more complex businesses that can be valuable to everybody. Unfortunately, the Tertiary Economy has a tendency to become unmoored from underlying economic reality and to eat up more and more of the total share of economic activity in the form of speculative bubbles. The more emphasis on the Tertiary Economy, the more bubbles like this happen. Our current economy is something like 75% in the Tertiary by notional dollar value, which is definitely something to think about.

<h4 id="org8c690b1">Work Out Your Relationship to Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c690b1">
<p>
This is the bit of this post I had the hardest time writing. It's big, weighty, and feelings run very strong around it. So I'll just try to dive in. At one time or another, all of us grapple with questions like "what's the point of all this?" or "how do I know what to really care about?" Some of us find answers that work for us in the teachings of a religion or a philosophy. Others of us look to what science and reason can tell us. And some of us try to bring our eyes down to the here and now and focus on what's right in front of us and set aside such big, maybe unanswerable questions. Perhaps the most common response is to distract ourselves from the questions so that we don't have to think about them. Television, booze, sex, jobs, gadgets, jewelry - whatever our own vice might be, we find something that lets us ignore those questions for a while. This is a bad long-term strategy, for at some point, <i>something</i> will happen that will show you the distractions for what they are - empty, meaningless, a waste of your precious time and attention. Sometimes this can hit like a ton of bricks: maybe someone you love dies, or maybe the relationship you've built your life around ends, or you find out you've only got a few months to live. If you wait for these heavy moments to think seriously about meaning, you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">gonna have a bad time</a>. Instead, start now. I won't tell you what traditions to explore, and I certainly won't tell you what conclusions to come to. This kind of thing is irreducibly personal, and what works for me is unlikely to work for you. If you're at a loss on where to start, there's an online book called <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> that I think does a pretty good job of outlining many of the reasons this is a thorny problem, approaches that have historically been tried and some of the problems with them, and so forth. You could also do worse than to read some ancient philosophy. If there's a religious tradition that's familiar or appeals to you, you might see what it has to offer. Wherever you start, don't expect this to be a quick project, something you sort out over the summer and never think about again. Wrestling with meaning is a life-long challenge, but one that can make everything else far more worthwhile.

<h4 id="orgf5a53c3">Meditate Discursively</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf5a53c3">
<p>
Lots of folks these days take seriously the idea of taking a bit of time every day to get your mind right, which is great. On the other hand, almost all of them practice forms of "mind-emptying" techniques that seek to still conscious thought, which is a bit less great. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with such techniques in and of themselves, but they have some little talked-about downsides. First off, very many folks find them tough to get started with or keep up. Secondly, even for folks who make a habit of it, many don't get that much out of them. Thirdly, and most seriously, a small number of people have very strong negative psychological reactions (most often if they jump straight into something like a week-long silent retreat with no prior training). Luckily, there's another method of meditation called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/68294.html">"Discursive Meditation"</a>, which I learned from John Michael Greer. This method has a long history, tremendous benefits, and pretty much perfect safety.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to do it: sit up straight in a chair, breathe deeply, and spend several minutes thinking about a specific theme of spiritual/philosophical significance. That's it! If you'd like more detail, check out the link above for a series of posts that lay it out step by step. You get all the good of training your attention not to wander, breathing deeply, and paying attention to your posture, while also giving your thinking mind a good workout as well. I've tried a wide variety of <a href="https://courses.liveanddare.com/limitless-life-meditation">meditation techniques</a>, and this one has been by far the most rewarding for me. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but think over giving it a shot. It's easy, safe, and works equally well whatever your spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) may be.

<h4 id="org183b21b">Express Romantic Interest First, Friendliness Later</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org183b21b">
<p>
Given the expectations and norms of our current culture, this one might be most useful for heterosexual males, but I hope it's helpful to whoever might need it. Many young folks, when they find themselves romantically interested in someone take an approach of "let's get to be friends, and then I'll ask her/him out later". This sounds reasonable, but is actually a terrible plan born of cowardice. Yes, I know, harsh, but that harshness comes from my own bitter experience of trying to follow this plan back in the day. Basically, asking someone out is scary, and we scramble to  mitigate that fear any way we can. It seems like asking someone out will be less scary if we know the other person already likes us as a friend. Plausible, but crap. Being friends is not the same as being lovers, they're different relationships with different dynamics and different needs. Of course, there is <i>some</i> overlap, but it's actually easier to go from "we went on a date and there wasn't any chemistry" to "so let's just be friends" than it is to go from "we feel comfortable together as friends" to "so do you want to risk ruining that with awkwardness by going on a date?" So, if there's someone you think you might want to date, ask them out instead of trying to be friends first.

So yes, kids aren't for everyone, and you definitely shouldn't have a kid if you aren't ready or don't really want one, but overall, kids are pretty great. I wanted to state this explicitly, because from the outside, it's easy to see what sucks about having kids: they take your time, they're expensive, they throw fits, they cover you in snot and get you sick, and so on. The thing is, from the outside, it's also harder to see what is great about having kids: watching a human gradually come online, seeing your own facial expressions mirrored back to you, having someone who feels emotions more intensely than you even know how to run up, throw their arms around you, and bury their face in your shoulder. There is absolutely nothing like it.

<h4 id="org7462fe6">Learn from the Stoics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7462fe6">
<p>
There's a lot of great stuff in ancient philosophy, but if I had to pick one thing that's most helpful, it would be the core insight of Stoicism: "you can't control what happens to you, but you <i>can</i> control how you react to it". Simple to state, hard to live. Someone cuts you off in traffic? You didn't make that happen, but you have full control over whether you get mad, how mad you get, and what you do because you're mad. Again, I know, easier said that done. And the Stoics acknowledged that you might not be able to stop that initial flare of anger from appearing, but <i>you are not your emotions</i>. They are something that happen to you, and you can choose to engage with them or distance yourself from them. Sometimes anger is useful, because it motivates you to right wrongs. Other times it just stresses you out for no reason. Learning to get inside your own cognitive processes like this is enormously helpful. Instead of being jerked around by whatever emotion happens to flare up due to circumstances, you can decide to steer your life based on whatever values you find truly important.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org93ede19">
<p>
Most folks say that time is your most valuable resource, but I'd tweak that to say that <i>attention</i> is your most valuable resource. We've all had hours or days or weeks where we didn't do much and felt vaguely crappy afterwards. We've also all had experiences of intense, focused attention, maybe only for a few minutes, that have stuck with us as peak moments. Time may be the quantitative measure of your finitude in this existence, but attention is the qualitative. Where I'm going with all this high-flying philosophy is that you should be utterly ruthless in guarding your attention from anyone and anything that tries to grab it without your express, willed intent. Ever had a pleasant evening spoiled when you got an text from someone wanting you to deal with some problem for them? Ever been right in the middle of straightening out a complicated argument in your head when an email alert has popped up and you lose that almost-there insight? Ever been at dinner with a date, you're really getting into the conversation, and then they check their phone? Notifications destroy the quality of whatever they interrupt, even if you don't do anything else with them right away. It's even worse when the notifications try to further hijack your attention - taking you to a social media post that is at the top of a rabbit hole you go down for hours or to a news story that freaks you out and ruins your mood for a whole weekend. Notifications are evil. Turn as many of them off as you can possibly get away with. Put your attention where <i>you</i> want it to go, and keep it there for as long as <i>you</i> decide.

<h4 id="org3403aea">Spend Some Time Outside</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3403aea">
<p>
This one really is this simple: every day if you can, but at least once a week, go spend some time sitting or walking outdoors. If you can get somewhere with plants and animals, go there. If not, consider moving somewhere less hellish, but in the meantime, sun or moon and sky will do just fine. Most of us spend most of our lives in large boxes looking at smaller, brighter boxes, focusing on an abstract world of words, images, and thoughts. As such, we have very little connection to the actual, physical world that keeps us alive. So, go outside. This shouldn't be some doleful chore (though, on some days in the summer in Texas, it can feel that way). Go feel the warm sun on your face, watch squirrels get frisky, check out good-looking guys or gals. Fifteen or twenty minutes is great if you can get it, but even just a handful of minutes can do wonders.

<h4 id="org6d04776">Don't "Follow Your Passion"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d04776">
<p>
This is the core idea in Cal Newport's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love-9781455509126/9781455509126">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. "Follow your passion" was a rallying cry for Baby Boomers who had followed the overly-conservative career advice of parents who lived through the Great Depression, and it was useful for getting folks used to the idea that maybe you shouldn't be miserable at your job if you can help it. Unfortunately, it was going too far to suggest that everyone has some deep, inborn passion that they just need to discover and their whole life will fall into place. Sure, some folks have these life-defining passions, but most of them figure that out pretty young. You ever met someone who can't help but draw, no matter what? That guy's got a passion, he doesn't need the advice to find it. Most of us don't have that. Instead, most of us <i>become</i> passionate about whatever we get <i>good at</i>. So, Newport recommends you find some skills that are both rare and valuable and then get good at them. Rare so that you're not a dime a dozen, and valuable so that other people will actually pay for it. Some examples: crafting ships in bottles is rare, but not so valuable. Being a decent, but not great, computer programmer is fairly valuable, but not that rare. So, if you want a challenging, meaningful career, find something hard to get good at that's in demand, and then get good at that. Once you do, you'll have more control over what you do, who you work for, and what you achieve.

<h4 id="org092d865">Learn a Craft</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org092d865">
<p>
Learn how to make something with your hands - scarves, bread, motorcycle engines, whatever grabs you. If you don't know what you might like making, try a wide variety of crafts (remember Divergence and Convergence?). Pay attention to what seems interesting even when you're not good at it (for me, that's woodcarving). Then take some classes, watch some videos, find a club, or whatever works - learn the skills you need and then make the time to do it. Getting really good might take a lot of work, but you can get to "just fine" in many things with very little practice: for example, I bet you could go from "bread comes from a shelf in the store" to baking tasty loaves in 2 or 3 tries, tops. The goal here is not to become an artisan and quit your job to do glassblowing full time (though, if you can make that work, more power to you). The point is to concentrate deeply and engage with something outside of yourself in the real world. You'll find there's a big difference between imagining what it takes to turn water, flour, and yeast into dough versus feeling a sticky substance and smooshing it around until it feels right. Not only is it helpful to ground yourself like this, it is <i>hugely</i> enjoyable! If you've never "lost yourself" in something you cared about, then you are truly missing out. Of the most meaningful things in my life, almost all of them involved this kind of focused attention.

<h4 id="orgf7af6ae">Make the Right Thing Easier</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf7af6ae">
<p>
I learned this from the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-house-that-cleans-itself/9780736949873">The House that Cleans Itself</a>  by Mindy Starns Clark. If you have tried something multiple times with the best of intentions, but for some reason it won't stick,  "I'll do it again, but this time I'll just try harder" is most likely a losing strategy. Instead, find a way to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, mail used to pile up on the credenza by the door. So, my wife and I put a two-drawer inbox on the credenza and a recycling bin next to it. Now, it's easy to sort what's mine or hers, and any junk mail goes right in the recycling. Apparently, it was too hard to walk the 15 feet to the main recycling bin, but it's not too hard to drop it within arm's reach. Go figure. Seriously, sometimes the tweaks that make something doable will be downright embarrassing. You can apply this concept in lots of areas of your life: set up automatic savings, don't have junk food in the house, put your alarm where you have to get out of bed to turn it off, have charging cables everywhere you might need to charge your phone, and so forth. There <i>are</i> some things where the answer is training your willpower, but more often than you might think, you can find a way to make it easier to win.

<h4 id="orgcfc584b">Fake It Till You Make It</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfc584b">
<p>
This advice has become much more widespread of late, but allow me to reiterate: you will not be good at something when you start. You get good at it by doing it. Humans are imitative animals, so if you want to be good at something, act as much like someone who is good at it as you can, and then keep at it. Eventually, the act will become the reality (likely far before you believe it). Don't put anybody at risk, of course, but it is almost always much safer to risk failing than you're afraid it is.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge446567">
<p>
If you're anything like me, you might have grown up drinking too much other liquid (like Dr. Pepper) and not enough water. Luckily, the Army beat this out of me, so I now take hydration very seriously. If you don't drink much water, you will be <i>shocked</i> at how much better you feel if you get enough. Here's how to do it: buy a 1 quart bottle that you will find convenient to carry around pretty much everywhere. Set a goal of drinking 2 of these a day (more if you do something that makes you sweat much). Set specific times/events by which to empty the bottle - for example "I'll drink one by lunch time and the next one by the end of the work day". If you find yourself getting light-headed, add a <i>tiny</i> pinch of salt to one or both bottles. If you are thirsty, add a 3rd or 4th bottle. If you drink any alcohol, consider going for that 3rd or 4th bottle just in case, and make sure you get some salt either in food or added to your water. Seriously, if you haven't been getting enough water, you have no idea how much it helps: headaches, tiredness, muscle growth, weight loss - all better with water.

<p>
Most of us far more time sitting than our bodies are built for (see the point about How to Stand/Sit), which leaves us stiff. So get some stretching in your life. You can experiment, but here are a few good options to try out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AakYeM23sI">Sun Salutations</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_bY6REpIPE">Five Rites</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHnN0pBKM4n4x7wI90zg-Od0hSOKawwJ">Daily Dozen</a> , <a href="https://coursetolife.com/courses/gymnasticbodies-fundamentals-f1-pro-bundle/">Gymnastic Strength Training Daily Limber</a>. Whatever you pick, pay special attention to your back, since that's where a lot of the bad effects of sitting show up, but it's all linked up, so find a whole body routine. If you have a more intensive stretching practice, like Yoga or Gymnastic training or the like, then that's awesome, but even if you are otherwise a couch potato, do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes stretching every day.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb5dde42">
<p>
Okay, this one is best done by demonstration, but it's important enough that I didn't want to leave it out here. As folks who spend far too much time sitting, we are all bad at standing, which paradoxically also makes us bad at sitting. We stand and sit in ways that damage our skeletons and circulatory systems, so it'd be great to fix that. If you want to go <i>real</i> deep, check out <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deskbound-1-standing-up-to-a-sitting-world/9781628600582">Deskbound: Standing Up to a Sitting World</a> by Dr. Kelly Starrett, which is where I got this checklist for proper standing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Feet</i>: Plant your feet, toes straight forward (not out to the side or pointed inward) about hip-width apart.</li>
<li><i>Knees</i>: Very slightly tense your muscles as if trying to turn your toes outward while keeping your heels planted, but don't let your toes actually move. You should feel this as a slight tension in your knees, which this movement stabilizes.</li>
<li><i>Hips</i>: Tense your butt cheeks to do a humping motion with your hips, moving your tail bone down and forward. For a less crude metaphor, imagine that your hips are a cup and that you don't want to pour any liquid out the front. This stabilizes your hips.</li>
<li><i>Lower Back</i>: Gently tense your abs, about 1/3 of full tension, pulling them back toward your spine</li>
<li><i>Upper Back</i>: Rotate your arms in your shoulder sockets. To do this, with your hands at your sides, rotate them until your thumbs face forward.</li>
<li><i>Head</i>: Move your head a bit forward and backward and feel for the spot where it's sitting right on top of the stable pillar you just made from the ground up.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations, you are now standing the way your body was designed for! Keeping your body in this position every waking hour is a bit much, but I use this process as a handy check-in to "reset" when I notice myself slouching.
</p>

<p>
To sit, just do steps 4-6, but you'll notice it's much harder. Your legs, and especially your hips, are doing a lot of the work of maintaining good posture when you stand, and when you sit, you basically don't have them to help.

<p>
The very same things are what excited me and disappointed me the most in this book. It presents intuition as a very no-nonsense ability that is critical for effective decision making, and gives advice on how to train to be better at it. Exactly what I wanted! On the other hand, it describes "intuition" as simply the ability to learn to detect patterns and apply past experiences to current situations, without consciously realizing  you've made that match - which is rather less romantic than I might hope for something as big and spooky as "intuition" to be. Once I set aside my childish disappointment, though, I found this book to be full of gems, and more importantly, to include detailed instructions on how to practice and train your team on these skills. I was expecting some help on decision making and ended up walking away with great techniques for leadership and creativity as well.

<p>
While book clubs are great for getting everybody on the same page (har har), a <i>Bizarro</i> Book Club is a way to inject more diversity into your intellectual life. I’ve talked before about the importance of high quality <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#maximize_the_value_of_your_inputs">inputs</a> to your creativity, and this is my favorite new method for finding stuff that I would never have on my own. It combines the traditional social benefits of a book club with a much more exciting way of engaging with books, and it’s just as easy to do.  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org70ffde0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org70ffde0">Everyday Book Clubs: the Good and the Bad</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org70ffde0">
<p>
With your everyday book club, the best bit is that everyone gets to share a common experience. For many, book clubs are little more than an excuse for a regular get together where everyone has something to talk about. How many times have you heard folks admit they don’t talk much about the book and instead gossip the whole time? Don’t get me wrong - that sounds like a great time! Even when they are basically just low key parties, traditional book clubs are great for building and maintaining friendships. What’s more, if your friends really <i>do</i> care about the books, you can get some real depth from differing points of view on the same work. The discussion allows everyone to realize things they hadn’t and to leave with a better appreciation for what they got out of the book. So there’s a hell of a lot to recommend book clubs. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, book clubs can have some shortcomings. For one thing, unless your group forms around shared tastes, someone is likely not to enjoy any given book picked by the group, which makes them less likely to have a good time or to bring worthwhile insights to the group. For another, any time you get folks together to talk about the same thing, they can all too easily fall prey to groupthink - somebody says something that sounds reasonable, and there’s no more discussion or debate. If you start a book club to broaden your mind, these weaknesses can bring on two different failures. First, if you form a group with shared tastes, you’re likely only going to read stuff that you were likely to find on your own, and your fellow members are more likely to think like you do, leading to groupthink. Secondly, if your group is made up of friends or neighbors, you’re more likely to run into books that you don’t like and to have a boring discussions about them.

<h3 id="org656a096">My Answer: the Bizarro Book Club</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org656a096">
<p>
Altogether, these risks are not a big deal if your goal is to drink some wine and hang out. When it comes to reading, though, I am something of a crazy person. I want more from my recurring book-focused events than booze and chit chat. So I had an idea: create a book club to <i>my</i> specifications, and rope my friends into it. Drawn by the innocuous name of “book club”, little would they realize how cunningly I had led them into my selfish trap. 
</p>

<p>
Here’s what I came up with: gather my most interesting reader friends, with rather different tastes, and each read a <i>different</i> book. Then, share what we got out of the book and discuss. I know these folks well enough to know they are careful readers and the ways our views differ, so their summaries are both high quality and reliable. When I discuss my own book, they make connections to other works that I’ve never heard of. Even better, the books they bring are those I <i>never</i> would have heard of on my own. Imagine if you could go on Goodreads and get a summary of a book that was guaranteed to be interesting, useful, and relevant to <i>you</i> - what a deal! Or if you whenever you made a note while reading, a little link appeared to a something that you (and the author) had never heard of before? This “Bizarro Book Club” was a way to hit the sweet spot between exposure to new thoughts and enough context for those thoughts to be meaningful.
</p>

<h3 id="orgb037efa">Your Challenge: Try It Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb037efa">
<p>
So, my challenge to you: try out a Bizarro Book Club for yourself! 
</p>

<p>
Here are the details on how to make one work:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find at least two friends who love to read (preferably with varied tastes)</li>
<li>Set up a regular get together, every month or so, that works for most of the group most of the time (we’re all over the country, so we use Google Hangouts, and Calendly)</li>
<li>Tell everybody to come ready to talk about a different book (they can share what they’re planning to avoid overlap and get excited)</li>
<li>If at least two people show up, that’s a quorum (try to make sure <i>something</i> happens every time you’re scheduled - that kind of consistency is important to keep something like this going)</li>
<li>Talk about your books! (Maybe set a time limit for each person/book to get to everybody)</li>
<li>If anyone gets so excited by a book discussed that they want to read it too, that’s okay, but they have to bring at least one new insight</li>
<li>BONUS: To be your group’s hero, take notes to share (especially appreciated by those who couldn’t make it)</li>
<li>DOUBLE DARE BONUS: Allow members to dare each other to read specific books (basically each member gives someone else a homework assignment)</li>
</ol>

<p>
We’ve met a few times so far, and it has worked beautifully - even better than I could have hoped for. I’ve learned so much new stuff and walked away with deeper insights and connections for my own books. Everybody else has had the same reaction. It gladdens my heart that it has exceeded all of my high expectations, and I can’t wait to keep making it even better. If you love to read, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, you won’t be disappointed.

<p>
This book provides a great overview of the tradition of Western philosophy. Besides providing useful summaries of some of the major thinkers and what their philosophy can do for you in your life, it shows the the connecting threads between thinkers that might seem totally unrelated at first glance. Each chapter gives a brief thumbnail of the biography and thinking of a major philosopher, which is great, but what's really useful about this book is that every chapter addresses a specific concern that everyone faces - such as unpopularity, money, and frustration. Alain's style is warm and gentle, with a hint of detached humor that makes for enjoyable reading. If you've ever thought "I wish I knew more about philosophy", this is the place to start.

Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my "operating manuals" for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality.

<b>By Julia Cameron</b>
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that if I picked this book up sight unseen and flipped through it, I would likely have put it back on the shelf - it has a lot of markers for being a bit too "woo woo" or "touchy feely" for my usual tastes. Fortunately, it came highly recommended by a bunch of well-grounded people that I respect, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. The basic premise is that everyone can be creative, but most of us have developed the idea that we're not allowed to or have otherwise blocked our access to our creative selves. To counteract this, it provides a twelve week guided program to lead to greater creativity. I'm not very far into the program, but already I am seeing the benefit of its two core habits: <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> and <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/">Artist Dates</a>. If you are already convinced that you could be more creative with some help and don't need as much back up, consider going straight to the workbook.

<p>
Man oh man am I loving this book. It puts out a comprehensive record of thinking about the concept of strategy in western thought from the Bible and Homer all the way to modern theorists. Along the way, Freedman provides analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various formulations and their applications. Despite what might turn into a dry, intellectual subject, the book is quite clear and readable, moving briskly through trends and eras of thought. For me, it's greatest value is highlighting the connections and influences between figures as disparate as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and John Boyd. I suspect that I will be coming back to my notes on this and its bibliography for years to come.

Besides being a phenomenal "learn to cook from nothing" cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn anything. Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn't done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it's rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in The 4 Hour Workweek and The 4 Hour Body, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other "how to learn" frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you're already a master cook, check this book out for it's advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.

I mentioned this book in my post on <a href="#storytelling_part_5-resources_for_digging_deeper">Storytelling Resources</a>, but I thought it deserved its own call out. An incredibly slim book, you can read and understand it in an evening, but will likely return to it again and again. This book clearly lays out the rules of modern American usage and style, favoring concise, vigorous prose. Even if you enjoy waxing more eloquent, this provides a great starting place from which to depart. It's also admirably organized, with a detailed table of contents and clear headings for the rules it propounds, making it ideal as a reference work (which it will be for the vast majority of its usefulness, since it will only take an hour or two to read it the first time). If you write at all for your living or for pleasure, you should have this book in easy reach at all times.

<b>By Walter Isaacson</b>

<p>
I have long irrationally avoided biographies, despite encountering a few excellent ones like Team of Rivals, so I decided I needed to remedy that to read one about a personal hero of mine. Leonardo stands as the archetypal "Renaissance Man", with achievements in art, architecture, science and more all under his belt. His brilliant and beautiful notebooks make any journaler feel inadequate. And yet, one of the most reassuring parts of this book is that it seems unlikely that Leonardo was as set apart intellectually as an Einstein or a Newton, nor as naturally artistically gifted as a Michaelangelo. Instead, Leonardo learned everything through a combination of insatiable curiosity and determined attention and focus. He was also able to turn his varied interests and propensity for abandoning projects into a firm set of multidisciplinary knowledge that spurred creative insight across fields. So he's something of a role model for those of us who worry we didn't win the genetic lottery or feel a lack of focus. This book is fantastic and humanizing while still highlighting the key takeaways from his life that we can enjoy in our own.

<p>
I’ve done my best to share a fantastic beginner’s guide to storytelling with this series, but there is a lot of depth to all of the topics that I’ve touched on. Below, I provide my recommendations on resources for digging into Story Structure, Effective Practice, Public Speaking, Oral Storytelling, Writing, and Visual Storytelling. In each section, I’ve provided a handful of my favorite “how to” resources, whether books, blogs, videos, or courses along with a section of illustrative examples applying the lessons you’ll learn from the how to books. These lists are by no means exhaustive, and if I’ve missed any of your favorite works on storytelling, please let me know, as I am always hungry for new insights on the topic.

<p>
The Story Grid by Shawn Coyne
</p>

<p>
If you want to dive deep into structure and how to put together a story that works, you could do a lot worse than to read The Story Grid. Shawn Coyne takes an editor’s approach to figuring out the nuts and bolts of what “works” in a story or not. The book focuses mostly on fiction, but he has regular blog posts and further material at the website that apply it to all sorts of other examples.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3221e18" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org3221e18">The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3221e18">
<p>
I dare you to time how long you can read about story structure without Joseph Campbell coming up. This book is where he lays out the fundamental structure shared by almost every enduring mythological tale across the world. Something about this sort of story speaks to the fundamental human experience, and has been for at least thousands of years. If you’ve ever heard of a “hero’s journey” or the “monomyth”, this book is where that comes from.

<div id="outline-container-org3713637" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org3713637">Save the Cat by Blake Snyder</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3713637">
<p>
Blake Snyder devotes his book to the end-to-end process of writing a screenplay, and so contains a lot of material not directly related to structure, but it has a rock-solid basic approach to thinking about structure, and even better, hands-on details about how to actually do that. My personal favorite thing from the book is “The Board” - a board you put up on the wall that shows the breakdown into acts, on which you place index cards for each scene, and for each scene you track the change in emotional charge and what the conflict is. The Story Grid covers a lot of the same ground, but they are useful to compare and cherry pick from.

<h5 id="org71f5c7a">On the Shapes of Stories by Kurt Vonnegut</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org71f5c7a">
<p>
This delightful (and short) video shares both Vonnegut’s clear understanding of story structure as well as his wit. I recommend watching it a few times: the first time to enjoy it as an entertaining presentation, and then again to realize “oh wait, there’s actually something there.”

<h5 id="org2ec5cb0">Mythology by Edith Hamilton</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2ec5cb0">
<p>
If you want to see the basic myths that Campbell was talking about, there are fewer better presentations than Edith Hamilton’s collection of Greek myths. Academically rigorous but easy to read, this is the “one book” on classical mythology.

<h5 id="org49775ec">Tootsie</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org49775ec">
<p>
Screenwriting classes love to use Tootsie as an example, because it’s just a good, solid story with a structure that works. Every scene moves the story forward, every scene has a shift in emotional charge, every scene has conflict, and the character grows exactly the way we want to see him do so.

<h5 id="org24d2eb0">A Christmas Story</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org24d2eb0">
<p>
I am especially tickled to point to this example because it is framed as a narrator telling a story - aren’t we all so meta. Every anecdote in the seemingly scattered remembrances of the narrator actually contributes to the overall story, following that Red Rider BB gun. It’s extremely tight and on point the whole time, which helps to explain why people happily re-watch every year.

<h5 id="org8ba131d">Pulp Fiction</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8ba131d">
<p>
Another favorite of film nerds, Pulp Fiction serves as a great example of how structure does not equal chronology. Tartantino chooses to show us scenes based on what he wants us to know about the character at the time, which means that he can’t rely on normal causality to carry the plot along if he gets the sequencing wrong. We’re left with a movie where we buy into the plight of a lot of pretty bad dudes and enjoy struggling along with them.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b01873" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org9b01873">The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9b01873">
<p>
Okay, this one is by the far the nerdiest thing I’m recommending, but hear me out. Each one of these novels works as a tightly structured hard boiled detective story - all the obligatory scenes and genre conventions are there in ways that are both satisfyingly familiar and intriguingly new. At the same time, each book builds the overall character arc of its titular protagonist, Harry Dresden (spoiler alert) and calls back to previous novels in both expected and unexpected ways. The quality certainly improves over the course of the series, but even the first few books are enjoyable stand alone detective stories.

<p>
What does cooking have to do with Storytelling? Not much, but the first section of this book breaks down Tim’s recipe for deconstructing a new skill to learn and how to maximize the value of your practice. I like to think I’ve done a lot of the deconstructing and sequencing work for you on Storytelling with this series, but it’s a meta-skill worth learning. As an added bonus, if you don’t already know how to cook, this is the best learn-to-cook cookbook ever written.

<p>
Short and to the point, Coyle distills the lessons he has learned from neuroscientists, coaches, and performers for building world-class talent into short tips. The book is helpfully organized into sections focused on getting started, building skills effectively, and maintaining motivation when it gets hard. Intended as a quick reference to be carried around and looked at again and again, this book won’t convince you that deliberate practice is the way to get great if you don’t already believe it, but it will help you immensely in actually doing the work.

<p>
Josh Waitzkin is terrifyingly brilliant and has an amazing ability to learn new fields to highest levels of mastery. His book is one of my personal operating manuals, and every time I return to it, I realize that I didn’t understand it as well as I thought before. His section on “Making Smaller Circles” is especially relevant for how to approach practice once you’ve already identified the skill or had the basic insight you need to work on.

Scott is a fantastic resource on all things learning related, and he relentlessly looks for ways to make his learning more effective.

<p>
While there are lots of works on improving your memory and even on memory competition, I chose to highlight Joshua Foer’s because it focuses on his own journey going from having no idea such as a thing as “mental athletics” existed to himself competing and succeeding as one. It provides a really impressive example of what you can achieve by learning the right way to practice and following through.

Dramatized, of course, but the true story of someone with some pretty serious challenges to telling stories working his butt off to get it right.

We’ve talked about this book before, but it is the best “one stop shop” on how to go from zero to giving great presentations I’ve seen. It discusses, structure, practice, and delivery in ways that will be familiar to you from this series, and has a great recommended reading list at the end, with some of the same titles you’ll see here. I especially appreciate its emphasis on tying together the spoken message and whatever visuals you are presenting, and how they can reinforce each other to create a stronger whole.

There are a lot of different courses offered by Dale Carnegie Training these days, some focused more specifically on public speaking than others, but the underlying principle for all of them is to better understand and empathize with other people as human beings.

Another recommendation that I have to provide on the strength of what I’ve heard, this is the best known way to make sure you get a lot more chances to speak in public and learn by doing. They have clubs all over the world and create a supportive environment for people to build their skills as a speaker and get meaningful feedback. If you don’t have a job that requires a lot of presentations (or if you do and are hungry for even more), this is a great way to get your reps in.

<p>
This article provides a nice overview of how to approach improving your public speaking, and goes into more specifics than we’ve covered in this general series on storytelling. The thing I like the most about it are the links - each section provides a basic overview, but there are a lot of links to dive deeper on specific topics as needed. That’s not all - the article linked is part of a series on giving presentations, which itself is part of a series on Communication skills. Mindtools has a pretty smart nesting and linking of related skills and makes a great resource for a motivated learner.

Otherwise known as “Fake it ’til you become it, this is one of my favorite TED talks of all time, and is applicable to much more than just public speaking. It talks about the feedback loop created by our body language, the mental states they create, and what we believe about ourselves. Does public speaking terrify you? If so, the cure is to adopt the posture and body language of someone triumphant and powerful to counteract your natural scared body language. It sounds nuts, but it works.

The famous Chicago-based group invented comedy improv as we know it, and has codified how to succeed when improvising. If you don’t happen to live in Chicago, there are improv groups just about everywhere. What does improv have to do with storytelling? It gets you used to finding relevant connections with other people and spinning them into a story, and also teaches you to read what’s working for your audience and what’s not. Plus, you’ll bomb a few times, which feels terrible, but then you keep going and you realize it’s not a big deal, which is crucial to build the confidence to tell entertaining stories with enough verve.

Podcasts are another favorite form of verbal storytelling for me, because they have to be good enough to work without visuals of any kind. Carlin does a remarkable job of calling up vivid images in your mind of the events he describes and invites you to empathize with the actual lived experience of the human beings that were there. Really good stuff, but be forewarned: most episodes are better named “audiobooks” and run several hours long. Perfect for long drives, not so great for bite sized enjoyment.

My wife turned me on to this one, where Mahnke recounts historically attested tales of weird and creepy stuff. Most of the stories are not (and cannot be) verified as actually happening, but all of them are things that people at least said actually happened - you know, folklore. Even though Mahnke’s cadence includes the occasional hilariously inexplicable pause, he effectively holds your interest and builds tension to creepy climax of each episode. Unlike Hardcore History, these are usually just the right length for listening while doing chores or making a commute.

My one complaint is that it’s structure as a collection of disconnected memories leaves something to be desired in the referencing things later department - but perhaps that’s the point, you have to digest it to get the good stuff out of it

<h5 id="orgd25b960">Words that Work by Frank Luntz</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd25b960">
<p>
A wonderfully pragmatic book that focuses on the importance of how you say it when most of are laser focused on what it is we want to say. While the thrust of the book is on persuasion, as Luntz has worked as a marketer and political speechwriter, the advice to choose your words based on the impact they will have on your audience applies to anything that relies on words. I find it especially useful to compare and contrast with The Elements of Style, which is predominantly focused on aesthetics rather than persuasion.

<h5 id="org5a700a2">Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t by Steven Pressfield</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5a700a2">
<p>
In this brief work, Pressfield takes the lessons he’s learned writing in different fields - advertising, screenplays, fiction, non-fiction, and self help - and how he applies them across the board. The title reveals the most important lesson: people are busy and don’t want to read anything unless there’s a reason it is compellingly interesting to them - which means you need to develop some serious empathy to get anywhere as a writer. Funny how that keeps popping up about storytelling, right?

This is a much more “literary” book than I usually read and enjoy, but it’s dream-like descriptions of bizarre cities are extremely vivid and compelling. There’s a “twist” at the end that most people know before they come to the book, but honestly, I just enjoyed it for imagining the impossible cities as real fantastic places, and enjoying the near-poetic language used to bring them to life.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd6d5899">
<p>
Most of my examples here of good writing are fiction, because most non-fiction writers must split their effort between getting good at writing and getting good at whatever they’re writing about, whereas fiction authors can focus almost entirely on the craft of making good prose. Steven Johnson’s early works show the signs of that division of labor - Emergence covers absolutely fascinating material and makes extremely valuable connections, but it gets a big clunky to follow at times. His more recent works, however, expertly weave together the disparate facts and insights he shares with you. Honestly, I could have picked from several books, but I like Where Good Ideas Come From the best.

Steven Pressfield may not be a Proust or a Hemingway, but I enjoy his books a lot more. Gates of Fire does a great job of describing action in an exciting way while simultaneously exploring the nature of fear, bravery, and loyalty.

Again, most folks would not point to Neal Stephenson as a prose stylist, but this book is the perfect example of nailing  the execution of a techno-political thriller. As I’ve mentioned before, Stephenson is one of my favorite authors, and I’ve read all of his books, so this one especially stood out by being different in style to his others. The long, information-rich digressions that I so love from Snow Crash and The Baroque Cycle are completely missing here, because this book is all about creating tension and then ratcheting it up relentlessly. Other than Breaking Bad, I have never seen such an expert display of continually increasing stakes: imagine an infinite sequence of falling out of frying pans into fires into frying pans and so on.

<p>
For those of you not familiar with comics, Will Eisner is the guy after whom their biggest award is named - he started writing comics in New York in the 30’s when his high school buddy Bob Kane (creator of Batman) suggested he give it a go, coined the term “graphic novel”, and worked hard to argue and prove that comics could tell  serious stories and were a legitimate literary form. This book takes what he learned from his decades of experience creating and teaching sequential art and distills it into a guide to make sure the visuals are always in service to the story - and not the other way around. Beautifully illustrated (duh) and cogently written, this book is useful for anyone who needs to convey messages with a combination of words and images, not just artists and flimmakers.

<h5 id="orge0e2eea">Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge0e2eea">
<p>
This is another meta-work: a comic book about comic books. Why am I harping on comics so much here? Well besides being a big nerd and enjoying them quite a lot, they provide an excellent comparison point to writing (nothing but words) and movies (moving pictures combined with spoken words) that allows examination of what is the same and what is different - and McCloud does exactly that. The central conceptual point of the work is that comic readers are active participants in the creation of the story, because they have to fill in the gaps between every frame. Writers and filmmakers can pull off that trick if they try, but with comics it is absolutely essential and pervasive. That creates a medium with a unique form of engagement worth exploring.

I found this video when I was looking for examples of composition and pacing done well for the post on Delivery and was immediately hooked. As my previous posts have made no effort to hide, I’m a big fan of everything Genndy Tartakovsky does, and this explained how he does it with remarkable clarity and great examples. I’ve since watched several episodes of Samurai Jack and keep noticing the three techniques identified here. As with comics, I like analyses of animation as a way of learning about film, because the lack of human actors and overt stylization allows you to focus on form and composition and such like very purely.

While this book is not about storytelling exactly, it is about learning to understand and use “visual language”, which can greatly improve communication and understanding, particularly of abstract concepts. This book addresses many of the challenges with learning and using visual language, from people not even stopping to consider it all the way to insecurity over artistic or creative ability hindering visual output. It provides a lot of very concrete guidance on how and when to use visual language in business and personal settings, all without being good at art. Pairs extremely well with Show and Tell above and Gamestorming.

I love Samurai Jack, but these shorts combine Tartakovsky’s stylistic elements described in the video linked above with my lifelong love of Star Wars. Taken as a whole, I “joke” that these are my favorite prequel. Originally aired as 3 minute (later expanded to 15 minute) shorts between programs on Cartoon Network, these are incredibly tight little self contained stories that nonetheless build into an overall picture of the Clone War, seamlessly linking the end of Attack of the Clones with the beginning of The Revenge of the Sith. Even if you are not a fan of Star Wars, check out the expert use of environments, composition, and carefully choreographed fight scenes.

<p>
As the only Zack Snyder film I completely enjoy, I give full credit to Frank Miller for the original, which Snyder very directly adapted. Yes, this is the second time Thermopylae has come up in the examples here, but that is to be expected from a classicist infantryman. The graphic novel showcases Miller’s high-contrast style and impressive composition, but also uses size and placement of frames/panels to expertly pull you through the story. It is also just as much a story about storytelling as less gory titles like The Sandman - about the story Western Europe tells itself about its past, the stories a culture tells itself about its values, and the stories we tell ourselves to link our past with our present.

This movie is visually stunning. It came out in 1964 and I first saw it in 2017, and more than 50 years later, it still looks fantastic.  Not “good for its time” but “good for all movies ever made” in a way that is unfortunately rare. It treats us to not one, but four separate expertly told traditional Japanese ghost stories. It’s not an especially scary movie, but it is riveting and beautiful. I recommend it as an example of visual storytelling because for those of us who are American, it removes familiar cultural and artistic conventions and stands on the strength of its craft as a film alone.

<b>By Will Eisner</b>

<p>
Written by a giant of the sequential art field, this book covers the insights from decades of creating and teaching about the use of comics to tell stories. Eisner defends and establishes the usefulness and seriousness of the form as a literary medium, capable of addressing themes and issues that matter. The central tenet of the book is that the visuals must be shaped by the needs of the story and not the other way around - otherwise you get lured into meaningless set pieces that serve no purpose but to show off something that looks good. It covers a lot of the same ground as the other works we've discussed on Storytelling, but does so with beautiful illustrations (duh) and a very different focus than works addressed primarily to crafters of prose.

Tim Ferriss recommended this book for writers of all kinds, despite its focus on screenwriting. I came to it in order to get a variety of perspectives on storytelling (speaking, writing fiction, writing screenplays, and so forth). Despite the fact that I often watch movies and think "I could have written something better than that!", I have no particular ambition to become a screenwriter, but I have nonetheless found this little book quite helpful. It's advice to get really clear about what your story is about applies across the board, and I appreciate its brass tacks focus on the fact that for anybody to ever experience your fantastic art, you have to sell it, which means people have to want to buy it. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a quick, fun read on how to write punchy things that get people's attention.

We've talked before about War of Art and it's discussion of Resistance, the force within us that stops us from creating and achieving what we might. Well, Turning Pro is Pressfield's "how to" on overcoming that force, and it mostly comes down to doggedly showing up to do the work every day, regardless of how inspired you're feeling. While I find War of Art more inspirational overall, this work is a great companion that gives you concrete steps of what to do when you commit to following the advice in WoA.

This book has been on my list for a long time, but I only just now got around to reading it, and man was I missing out! It breaks down the mysterious art of writing a story that "works" into comprehensible and testable steps. That's what I think is most remarkable about this book: not that it tells you the components of a story that works (we've been getting that since Aristotle), but that it gives you tools to tighten up the feedback loop on your stories - you can evaluate your success or failure and make adjustments using these tools. You still have to put in the work and get inspired by the Muse, but all of the guesswork is removed. It has a really strong emphasis on writing fiction, but the lessons are applicable to any sort of storytelling.

I've been using the approach outlined in this book for years now, thanks to some fantastic mentors at work, but I only just got around to reading it. I don't know what took me so long to get to it - it was great, and it only took me a little over two hours to read even taking a lot of notes. The basic premise of the book is that you should tell the truth, you should tell it as a story, and you should present the story with pictures as much as possible. It goes into more detail on how to make all of that happen of course, but if you're only ever going to read one book on how tell a story that people will care about, read this one. The four presentation Storylines (Presentation Underlying Message Architectures, or PUMAs) are worth the price of admission alone.

This book identifies six types of "simple rules" that offer enough guidance to be useful but enough flexibility to respond to complexity. More exciting than that, it walks through how to create your own simple rules for work and life. Unless you're my kind of geek, it's not the sexiest topic in the world, but for one thing, it's shockingly useful, and for another, the authors use a conversational tone that makes for pleasant reading. Whether you're looking to make better decisions about investing, dating, or your company's strategy, this book has you covered.

<b>By Steven Johnson</b>

<p>
I worry a bit that this is becoming the Steven Johnson fan club, but I am really enjoying his books recently. This one takes a look at history through the lens of what was made possible through the development of some key technologies, like glass and sanitation. Besides providing a plethora of fun trivia, like the fact that in the mid nineteenth century it was more practical to raise the entire city 10 feet than to tunnel under it to install a sewer system, or that chlorinating water reduced infant mortality by ~40%, the book provides a fascinating reframe of how we normally process history. Instead of looking at decisions made by individuals or trends embodied in governments and cultures, it asks "what couldn't have happened without this technology that did happen after it was invented?" Maybe not as immediately useful as Where Good Ideas Come From, but it's possibly a more approachable and enjoyable introduction to Johnson's style. Definitely check it out.

<b>By Carl Gustav Jung, translated by H.F.C. Hull</b>

<p>
If you're like me, you probably have a vague idea of Jung from high school English classes, and something about archetypes. Maybe you heard he was an important influence on Lucas when he made Star Wars. If you studied psychology, you may have gotten a brief discussion about how he was important psychologist for a while, but we've moved past his outdated theories. Well, I'm here to tell you that Jung is both weirder and smarter than you probably think, and that makes it worth reading his stuff for yourself. Synchronicity is a perfect introduction because it is short and enjoyably mind-bending. Jung basically argues that disparate events can be meaningfully linked in ways besides causality. If nothing else, it is an enjoyable mental exercise to wrestle with such an alien concept, and who knows, you might gain a richer understanding of your own experience of the world.

I just couldn't resist a book about where the voice in your head comes from when today's post is about imagining other people's voices. I have no idea at how well regarded this book is currently as a credible explanation of where consciousness came from, but it makes a fantastic tool for imagining <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4893">what if the world really were that way? What would it mean?</a> The book argues that "consciousness" - an almost unending voice in your head that narrates your thoughts and what's going on and is perceived as "yourself" is actually a rather recent phenomenon. Jaynes says that the Old Testament documents a culture going through the transition, and that you see similar evidence in Mesopotamian history as well. There's nothing immediately practical here, but it's enjoyably mind-blowing. Plus, season one of Westworld will make a lot more sense, so there's also that.

I've mentioned this book before as one of my <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life">Operating Manuals</a>, but today I want to emphasize its advice on cultivating a commitment to quality and building in structures of ebb and flow, stress and relaxation, into your life. On first read through, this book comes off as a bit esoteric and hard to apply, but that is because it provides principles important enough to span multiple disciplines, and you will have to figure out how to apply them to your areas of concern. When you do, though, the payoff is pretty great. Read this book if you are especially interested in deeply mastering a field or if you want to improve your ability both to "turn it on" and "turn it off".

We covered this in detail in a <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/9/1/two-creativity-frameworks-creativity-part-4">previous post</a> in this series, but it really is worth including again. Of all the books in this section, this one is the most straightforwardly actionable - it provides a step by step framework to use. The scope of the framework, though, is broad enough that I think it appropriately fits into the realm of the strategic. Read this book if you need advice on how to structure your work when presented with a problem that calls for creativity.

I have wanted to talk about this book in this series so many times, but all I've been able to swing is a mention here and there. It is a fascinating and entertaining look at the commonalities between innovators in fields as diverse as biology, literature, and air conditioning invention. From a practical standpoint, it gives guidance on how to cultivate those commonalities in your life - such as living and interacting with "liquid networks", taking notes in a way that lets you develop "slow hunches", and allowing "fuzzy connection making". Read this book if you want structure your life in a way that maximizes your potential to innovate.

<p>
Though it focuses on building a start up, the core thesis of this book is that start ups are near perfect vehicles for world-changing innovation, but to make that happen, you have to think about the world in certain ways. The most provocative way this book recommends is to seek out "secrets" - things that you know or suspect and the rest of the world either doesn't know or thinks is ridiculous - and then use those secrets to build a monopoly in a field.  To find such secrets, Thiel suggests that you ask yourself "what are things that I believe that everyone else thinks are ridiculous?" Read this book if you are trying to figure out why creativity matters or how you can change the world with it.

This delightfully irreverent book focuses on using playfulness and the unexpected to generate novel solutions. My favorite suggestion from the book is its recommendation to use "oracles" - something that provides arbitrary responses which you have to apply to your current situation.

I first read this book years ago in college, and I absolutely love it. The author's stated intent is to help you be more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat">mentat</a>, which is just fine with me. It covers a diversity of topics from improving memory to mental clarity to, yes, creativity. This book served as my exposure to topics that would later become deeply important to me like meditation, breathing exercises, and the link between physical and mental fitness. Published by <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> it has the easy referenceability of a well-executed technical manual. I also discovered while working on this post that the author has a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mindhacker-Tips-Tricks-Games-Level-ebook/dp/B005LGUMKQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505445702&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mind+performance+hacks">new book</a> out on similar topics that I am eager to check out.

Okay, last Operating Manual, I promise. This book has so much high quality stuff, but most of what will be directly relevant to creativity will be in the Wealthy and Wise sections.

I can vouch for Eilzabeth Gilbert's <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius">talk</a>. She talks about how useful it is for writers (and other creatives) to view inspiration as an external force coming from a muse outside of their control - because it removes the pressure of trying to be great. Instead, you just have to show up and do the work, and when the muse wants to visit, she does. It does a lot of the same work as War of Art above.

Finally, creativity is all about practice and one of the best investments you can make is in a course. We've covered a chunk of the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity process</a>, but a day long course will be literally life-changing. Unless you practice, you can't really internalize a rigorous step-by-step approach to problem solving, and we all make mistakes when learning. A course solves that problem by including a skilled facilitator who knows where people are most likely to fall back on old habits and how to step in and address them. Also, you'll get to explore your <a href="https://www.basadurprofile.com/default.aspx">problem solving profile</a>, which will blow you away when you start seeing how relevant it is in the workplace.

This one is not explicitly about creativity, but I think you'll find it more helpful in that respect than you might think at first glance. Written by a pair of Navy SEAL officers who served together in Ramadi, Iraq when it was at its worst, this book lays out deceptively simple principles for effective leadership. I say deceptive because simple does not mean easy. Following the straightforward advice is much harder than understanding it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-maximize_the_value_of_your_creative_inputs">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-September-08
</p>

<p>
In the previous posts on creativity, I’ve mentioned “inputs” pretty frequently, but I haven’t gone into much detail about them. Today, I’ll talk about what I mean by inputs, why they’re important, and share some rules for maximizing their usefulness. I’m very excited to be sharing this with you, because I think it’s an often overlooked aspect of creativity that can have huge effects on your work with very little effort.
</p>

<p>
First off, let’s get on the same page about what I mean by inputs. I am using this fairly vague term to mean anything that you read, watch, listen to, view, or otherwise interact with in the hopes that it will contribute directly or indirectly to your creative process. That’s a pretty broad, abstract definition, let’s go for some examples. A novel you read for pleasure is probably an input, but one you read to get in the right frame of mind for writing your own story is definitely one. Music you listen to while you drive to work might be an indirect input, but music you analyze for technical skills you might incorporate into your own performance definitely is. The bill you get in the mail almost definitely is not an input, but hey, it just might inspire you. What these distinctions point to is that “input” is not really a category with discrete edges, but rather a radial based on intent: some things are dead center, others are so far away that they almost definitely won’t function as creative inputs. One of the reasons we have to talk probabilistically rather than deterministically is the role the subconscious plays in creativity: a relevant connection to that story you read three years ago might suddenly pop into your head, even if you were reading it with no particular purpose at the time. As such, while the rules I recommend below will serve you well with any sort of material you engage with, you don’t have to become a total hardass about everything you interact with - apply these more rigorously in areas you are specifically targeting for your creative work (unless you really want to). So without further ado, here’s Jeff’s rules for creative inputs:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4528c69" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4528c69">1- Privilege Long Form over Short</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4528c69">
<p>
As much as possible, pick a book over a blog post, a blog post over a tweet, a tweet over a comment. Seek out longer, more involved renditions of whatever you need, and actively avoid shorter versions where possible. There are a couple of reasons for this - first off, the longer something is, the more likely that the creator <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/28/how-to-build-a-large-audience-from-scratch-and-more/">put some real thought into it</a> and genuinely cared about it. This isn’t an ironclad rule, but it’s a reasonably useful heuristic. This can be hard to swallow in a world obsessed with speed, efficiency, and convenience - but remember, our goal here isn’t to go through as much stuff as possible, it’s to get genuine, long-lasting benefit from high quality stuff. Secondly, even if the longer form content isn’t actually any better than shorter stuff, engaging with it lets you <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">exercise your attention span</a>. As many of us have noticed in the age of the smartphone and constant availability, you can lose your ability to focus on just one thing at a time when every day is full of constant task switching. Fortunately, it works the other way too - you can practice focusing on one thing at a time for extended periods and <a href="https://calnewport.com/neil-gaimans-advice-to-writers-get-bored/">get comfortable with the boredom</a> you will almost certainly feel at some point. So longer stuff gives you a double whammy for improving creativity - higher quality material that simultaneously improves your ability to focus.

<div id="outline-container-org39fde34" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org39fde34">2 - Go for Depth over Breadth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org39fde34">
<p>
As with the advice in a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#two_creativity_frameworks">previous post</a>, to alternate rest and effort, this one also comes from <a href="https://joshwaitzkin.com">Josh Waitzkin</a>. We are living in a world of nearly infinite information at our fingertips, so you are unlikely to be challenged by a lack of exposure to neat stuff. Rather, you are at a much greater risk of never truly diving deep into something and finding the beautiful insights only available to someone who truly masters it. I’ve got to admit, following my own advice on this rule is incredibly hard - I am a hardcore serial dabbler. Breadth can be fantastic for creating truly novel connections between disparate material, but paradoxically, pursuing depth is required for truly getting the value out of breadth. If you have only a shallow understanding of two topics, you will only know what makes them different, or only perceive the similarities that are so obvious as to be worthless. Only a deep understanding of a topic will allow you to see its principles embodied in unexpected places.

<p>
At this point, you may have noticed a distinct lack of the terms "consume” and “content” - this has been entirely intentional. Consumption passively implies the material does all the real work, but creativity requires action. Likewise, content has a certain connotation of things produced to fill space or support some other aim, rather than for its intrinsic beauty or worth. So, I have emphasized interaction and engagement because you have to make material your own before you can use it in your creative process: probe it, question it, internalize it. 
</p>

<p>
The best way I know how to actually do this is by creating some version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>. Ryan Holiday <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">explains</a> the method he learned from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190714230235/http://powerseductionandwar.com/">Robert Greene</a>, which involves index cards in a box. I am strongly tempted to give this method a shot due to my love of all things analog, but thus far I have been seduced by the various conveniences of digital, and so use Evernote. My very favorite feature is the Evernote Web Clipper plugin for my browser. This allows me to easily store blog posts, articles, even entire web pages right alongside quotes, .pdfs, and my own notes. Further, I can sort and tag all of this stuff so that I can identify connections and themes when I review. The other feature that makes Evernote especially conducive to creativity is Context, which points to notes, websites, and other material that might be relevant to what you're currently viewing. Now, Context doesn’t always get it right, but the beauty is that this kind of <a href="https://www.alibris.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-from-The-Natural-History-of-Innovation-Steven-Johnson/book/12949732?matches=171">"fuzzy" connection-making introduces just enough errors to spur you to creative insights</a>, while usually helping you find things that you’re looking for. 
</p>

<p>
Whatever method you choose to use for engaging with your inputs, make sure you do not simply passively read, listen, or view: grab your inputs and shake them until their lunch money falls out.
</p>

<p>
To close, I'll repeat a no-doubt familiar refrain: there is so much more we could cover here, and I look forward to digging into it with you in the future. For now you've got a great set of easy rules you can start applying to the material you use in your creative process. I also want to point out that all of the creativity methods, exercises, and rules we’ve covered so far are multiplicative rather than additive - every one you adopt makes all of the others more effective. Little daily habits add up to life changing results pretty fast. Next time, we'll cover some resources to help you move beyond this base camp and venture into the wilds of creativity.

Ryan Holiday has been behind a lot of what I've talked about here and a lot of the links I've shared, but I haven't called him out explicitly yet. He's a modern day exponent of an ancient philosophy, and though my interest in stoicism predates my exposure to Holiday, I have found his works useful and engaging. He's best known for <i>The Obstacle is the Way</i>, which has been hugely influential with top performers from the business world to the NFL, but I have found this book more useful personally. It is a systematic analysis of how prone we all are to excessive self regard and the ways that destroys you - whether you are aspiring, achieving, or failing. Ego also hinders true creativity because it stops you from the real work you need to push limits and discover new frontiers.

Tim Ferriss and Ramit Sethi like to joke about how much their book titles sound like infomercials, but I have to admit that this book has them beat by a mile - One Minute Workout? That's even crazier than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE">six minute abs</a>. What you find when you actually dig in, though, is a thorough discussion of the science and benefits of High Intensity Interval Training. Even better, it presents a variety of HIIT workouts you can try out for your own health. Bang-for-buck-wise, HIIT is the king of exercises. Even better, training your heart to speed up and slow down regularly has dramatic effects on your brain's ability to do the same - so following the workouts in this book will help you not only be healthier, but more creative to boot. Not a bad deal for one minute (plus another 9 of warm up, cool down, and rest - but I can't blame them for the catchy title).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-two_creativity_frameworks">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-September-01
</p>

<p>
In our last installment in this series, we talked about <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/25/practicing-divergent-convergent-thinking-creativity-part-3">divergent and convergent thinking</a>. Keep that in mind, as it will be central to everything we discuss below. Today, we're going to talk about frameworks you can use to structure your creative efforts - one for teams and one for individuals. You can use either framework in the other situation, but I find them better suited to different applications.
</p>

<p>
When we discussed creativity frameworks <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">previously</a>, I mentioned the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/howwedoit/An8StepProcess/tabid/82/Default.aspx">Basadur Applied Creativity</a> method. It is comprehensive and fantastic, but I'm not going to lay out the whole system (go <a href="http://www.basadur.com/whatwedo/SkillBuildingWorkshops/tabid/75/Default.aspx">sign up</a> for a class!). Instead, I will focus on the 80/20 piece of the framework: Problem Formulation. This piece of the process is valuable precisely because people tend to blow it off if they aren't trained otherwise. In practice, taking the time to formulate the right problem statement makes an enormous difference in the quality of your solutions. One last point before we jump in: I have not attended any of the instructor certification workshops for this method - so take all this as the advice of a fellow practitioner, not as gospel.
</p>

<p>
Okay, with that out of the way, let's jump in. The first step is to take a "fuzzy situation" that your team wants to make better and come up with potential problems related to this fuzzy situation. A fuzzy situation might be something like "we aren't selling enough sprockets." In this and each following step, you will diverge and converge as separate, clear activities. It helps to have a designated facilitator around to shepherd people through the process. So, everyone diverges on potential problems - things like "our sales people are lazy," or "nobody wants sprockets anymore" or "lizard people are secretly sabotaging our sprocket selling efforts" - remember, bad ideas are welcome and even helpful when diverging. Your goal here is to get every possible thing that might be a problem out on the table - that's one reason this method works so well with groups, as it helps to get all the little bits of knowledge in different people's heads out and in the open where everybody can use it.
</p>

<p>
With lots of potential problems to consider, the group looks at them and converges on which ones are most worth developing further. To figure out if you're right, you're going to need facts - so step two is Fact Finding. If you skip this step, down the road you will hit a snag. Again, diverge on what facts might be relevant, and then converge on the ones that really are most useful. I should point out that at this phase, "facts" can include things that you know you need to learn. You can use these awesome fact finding questions to make sure you cover all your bases:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What do we know or think we know?</li>
<li>What don't we know that we would like to?</li>
<li>What have we already thought or tried?</li>
<li>Why is this a problem for us?</li>
<li>What will we get if we solve this problem?</li>
<li>What are we assuming?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The last step in Problem formulation is to arrive at a Problem Definition: a phrase or sentence that clearly states what it is that your team is actually trying to solve. A good problem definition will come in the form of "How might we <span class="underline"><span class="underline">_</span></span>?" As always, diverge on lots of possible problem statements based on the facts, and then converge on the one your team wants to focus on solving right now. If you have lots of potentially valuable problem statements, that's fine - you can always come back to them later, but you want to focus on the most valuable one until you solve it. This probably all seems rather involved just to figure out what the problem is, but after going through this a few times you'll see how valuable it is to take the time to aim at the right target instead of just blasting away at whatever presents itself.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">last time</a>, while the AC approach is amazing for teams, especially in a business setting, I find it a bit involved for individual creative work. For this, I like to follow Young's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503617585&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. The steps are pretty straightforward and his book spells them out well: gather materials, work them over to the point of exhaustion, put them out of your mind, wait for an idea to appear, and then modify the idea based on trusted feedback. I want to highlight two areas: working over the materials and putting them out of your mind.
</p>

<p>
Most folks these days have heard some variation of "<a href="https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/8156/is-there-any-scientific-literature-on-the-shower-principle-i-e-taking-a-bre">the shower principle</a>": the idea that creative insight often appears while doing something totally unrelated to the topic. Many of these people try to help it along by purposely changing activities to something unrelated to their challenge, relying on their subconscious to do the heavy lifting. Putting the work out of your mind is a great strategy, and an essential component for "aha!" insights, but going right to it misses a critical step: getting the material into a form your subconscious can work with. Your subconscious deals in feelings and intents and symbols, and not so much in words and reason. Unless you already deeply care about the topic, it is in a language your subconscious doesn't speak, so you have to translate the material.
</p>

<p>
To do so, you have to work at the material until it seeps deep into your mind - repetition is essential, and if you can find a way to intensify your emotional connection to the material, so much the better. What this looks like in practice is that you do everything your conscious mind can think of with the material - try different approaches, tweak different parts, re-arrange the parts - and keep doing that until it starts to look like mumbo jumbo and you hit a mental brick wall. The tricky part is telling the difference between "I'm a little bored" and "I really have nothing more to do with this" - pushing through that initial boredom is <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/09/05/john-cage-on-the-necessity-of-boredom/">critical</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you aren't sure which you're experiencing, take a short break without any new inputs - go for a walk, get some water, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/09/15/bootcamp-day-1/">that kind of thing</a>. Come back and promise yourself another 15-20 minutes on the matter at hand, even if you're just staring at your work so far.  If you still don't get anywhere, then maybe you're done working it over for now.
</p>

<p>
Only after you've internalized the material by doing everything you can think of with it do you want to put it out of your mind. Sometimes this can be easier said than done. If something is important enough to you for your subconscious to be able to do its thing, chances are that your conscious mind won't want to drop it. Here's a few things to help you out. First off, remind yourself that while it feels like you're "not doing anything," putting it out of your mind is an essential step in doing something about it. This can be hard, especially if you're a take-charge type - hence the conscious reminder. Second, it helps to choose something you find intrinsically enjoyable and emotionally stimulating. Not only is it easier to ignore a problem when you're enjoying something you love, the positive emotional engagement also stimulates the subconscious that you are relying on. Finally, much of your mind's ability to alternate between going hard and relaxing is directly influenced by your body's ability to do the same. Remember the <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/5/26/preventative-maintenance-self-care-part-2">bi-directional nature of stress and physiology</a>? Same deal. Josh Waitzkin talks about this quite a bit in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503618266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning">his book</a> and his <a href="https://tim.blog/tag/josh-waitzkin/">interviews</a> with Tim Ferriss. Strangely, because of this physical element, one of the best creativity exercises is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">High Intensity Interval Training</a>. The <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/One-Minute-Workout-Science-Smarter-Shorter-ebook/dp/B01IOHQ7RA/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">One Minute Workout</a> lays out several options for planning your HIIT workouts. Even if you don't go in for HIIT workouts, other physical considerations are still critical: at least eat well, get enough rest, and stay active somehow.
</p>

<p>
With the the two approaches above, you have some concrete guidance on what to do when you want to "be creative." I've focused on the non-obvious pieces of these two frameworks, but both are worth checking out in full when you have the chance. Next time we'll talk about some habits you can adopt to increase the quality and usefulness of the inputs to your creative process.

<b>Date</b>: 2017-August-25
</p>

<p>
Okay, so I had planned on covering all of the exercises in one post, but when I broke them out, I realized I would be delivering a gigantic, hard to digest mess. So I broke it up. Our next few posts will cover all of the exercises associated with the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/the_building_blocks_of_creativity">building blocks</a> we covered last time, starting with Divergent and Convergent thinking today. It's a great place to start, because if you develop your ability to separate these two ways of thinking, everything else will flow naturally.
</p>

<p>
For many people, the skill you will most need to improve is your ability to think up ideas - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">active divergence</a>. If you're like me, this seems like a mysterious ability some people are born with, and is totally opaque. Fortunately, whether or not some folks are more naturally inclined to be good at it, you can practice and improve. My favorite practice for this comes from <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a>. Here it is: write 10 ideas on a prompt, once a day every day. That's it. I first encountered it in his book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-Guide-Wealth-ebook/dp/B00U7IS4S0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503612736&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=choose+yourself+guide+to+wealth">The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth</a>, which is one of my <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life">mental operating manuals</a>, but you can also find it explained in this blog <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/">post on how to be "lucky"</a>. The lists don't even have to be on anything important - silly stuff works just as well for practicing. You aren't shooting for good ideas, you just come up with a lot of ideas. This is pure active divergence practice. As you do this regularly enough, you will start finding it much easier to think things up on the spot in any situation, which comes in pretty darn handy.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you're jamming on the above practice and you screech to a halt, unable to think of any more ideas. Here's a few techniques you can use to get the juices flowing again. The first is "unclumping" - look at one of the ideas you've already written and ask yourself what every possible variation of that thing might be. Say your prompt was "things that are round," and one of your ideas was "balls." You could unclump that by writing baseballs, basketballs, bocce balls, et cetera. If you are wired like I am, this may feel like you are "cheating," but actually you are stimulating exactly the muscle we want to exercise here. The next technique is to apply your five senses to the subject you are trying to generate ideas on. Maybe you're locked into things that stimulate sight, or feel, and are ignoring others. In the case of things that are round, "smell" might make you think of an orange, or "taste" might prompt you to think of a scoop of ice cream - and then you can go off in a whole new direction. Finally, there's a specific list of modifications you can apply in a handy acronym: T.R.A.N.S.F.O.R.M. - Twist/Turn, Rotate, Add, Novelize, Subtract, Fuse, Omit, Reverse, Minify/Magnify. I tend to default to unclumping when I feel stuck, but all three can really help you expand the number of ideas you generate.
</p>

<p>
We've covered how to generate more ideas, but some people find that relatively easy and instead are challenged by what to do with them once you have them. These people need more practice with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">active convergence</a>. Personally, I find this far easier and more intuitive than cranking ideas out, so I've had to engage in some reflection and discussion with people who think differently from me to figure out what to recommend here. There are two main ways you can come at evaluating the ideas you have previously generated: bottom up or top down. Bottom up approaches focus on evaluating ideas based on their similarity to each other, whereas top down focus on rating ideas with respect to how they fit pre-defined criteria.
</p>

<p>
My personal favorite convergence activity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram">affinity mapping</a>. This is a bottom up approach used to organically figure out groupings and categories. To give it a try, first actively diverge as above, but put each idea on its own sticky note. Then, find a big stretch of wall or whiteboard and start putting the ideas up there . As you add ideas, look at the existing ones and ask yourself "do these go together?" If so, place them close to each other. Don't worry too much about explicitly defining the criteria that makes them go together just yet. As you go through, you'll find that some of your clumps maybe should be split up, and others should be merged - that's okay, the point of the exercise is to discover these relationships.
</p>

<p>
An example top down approach is a model called a <a href="http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/pugh-matrix.html">Pugh Matrix</a> - a name I only recently learned from an engineer friend for something I've been doing for years. To do this, put each idea on a line in a spreadsheet. Then, label each column with the different criteria you are using. Then go through the matrix you just created and rate each criteria on the same scale (1-5 is a common one, but you can also go for binary or just use whatever makes sense). When you finish, you'll have a score both for each individual criterion but also an aggregate. If you want to get real fancy, you can apply different weights to different criteria. You can then perform all sorts of manipulations on the data so created (averages, spreads, et cetera). Just be careful to remind yourself that this is still a qualitative and subjective tool, despite its appearance of being a quantitative and objective tool thanks to all those numbers - just remind yourself you made them all up, you didn't measure them somewhere.
</p>

<p>
By way of an example, my wife and I applied this system when we bought a house. Before we started looking, we came up with a list of features that mattered to us. Once we had identified two houses we liked, we compared them by rating each characteristic. By going through piece by piece and seeing how both houses stacked up, it made it very clear which one we actually favored. So we put in an offer and ended up in a place we love, with the peace of mind that we thought out our decisions thoroughly.  
</p>

<p>
The above exercises are merely examples of the deeper principles of divergent and convergent thinking, but extremely useful and illuminating examples. Idea generation especially is a habit you can incorporate into your daily life and start noticing its application in diverse situations. Join us next time as we discuss how to apply and practice the two problem solving frameworks we introduced previously.

<p>
I mentioned this book in the previous posts on creativity, but it didn't get its own spotlight yet. It's a classic in the realm of creativity, and a lot of what has been developed since builds on its solid foundation. It takes an extremely practical approach by recommending various exercises a teacher might assign students to encourage and develop lateral thinking, but these are just as easily self-imposed by those of us lacking adult supervision. My very favorite takeaway from this book is the idea that sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea first.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_building_blocks_of_creativity">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-August-18
</p>

<p>
Last time we came up with a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/defining_creativity">definition of creativity</a>, and today we're going to talk about some of its core building blocks, from deferring judgment to the inputs you take in. These fundamental concepts will give you the raw materials you need to understand and undertake specific exercises to be more creative yourself - some of which we'll detail in our next installment of the series.
</p>

<p>
The first and most important concept you need for better creativity comes from Edward De Bono's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Step-ebook/dp/B003V1WTLI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502986629&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lateral+thinking">Lateral Thinking</a>: sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea. Everything else we'll talk about grows from this small seed. You can grasp this simple idea in moments, but like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Othello</a>, you can spend a lifetime truly mastering it. For your first challenge, the entire tradition of western thought has focused on <a href="http://www.andyeklund.com/is-linear-thinking-bad/">Linear Thinking</a>, which de Bono contrasts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">Lateral Thinking</a> in his book of the same name. Our education and culture reinforce linear thinking relentlessly. It requires every step make sense and build to the next. It's how you make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument#Deductive">an argument that doesn't suck</a>. It's how you prove things in math or map out a promising theory in science. If one step is wrong, every step after it is wrong, end of story. So when you operate in a linear thinking mode, you carefully check every step of progress to make sure you're still on firm ground.
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong: linear thinking is extremely important, despite being less sexy than lateral thinking. At some point, you have to figure out if your brilliant idea actually works. The trouble is that linear thinking can hamper you from having the good idea in the first place. Sometimes something silly or wrong gets you to look at a problem in a new way, which produces genuine insight. You give yourself permission to have bad ideas that can get to good ideas later with a habit of thought called <a href="https://blog.basadur.com/2015/02/04/does-deferring-judgment-really-impact-creativity-or-does-immediate-judgement-save-a-lot-of-time-and-provide-the-hard-nosed-focus-that-real-world-innovation-demands/">Active Deferral of Judgement</a>.  Simply catch yourself whenever you go "that was silly" or "that will never work" while you are trying to think up ideas. We'll talk more in the next part of the series about techniques to build this habit.
</p>

<p>
Deferring judgment lets us properly separate thinking into its two flavors: <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">divergent</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">and</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">convergent</a>. Divergent thinking is maximizing the number of ideas on the table - it is often referred to as ideation or idea generation. Convergent thinking is looking at previously created ideas and deciding which ones are relevant - it is often called evaluation. Both kinds of thinking are equally important and equally necessary - remember that my definition of creativity requires things be both new and useful.
</p>

<p>
Turns out most of us find it easier to do one or the other, and if we don't learn about these differences, we get puzzled by other people's challenges. For example, I have a friend who can fill a page with brand new ideas while I'm still struggling to break 10. On the other hand, ask him to take 100 things and group them based on similarity and he'll be agonizing while I'm happily clustering sticky notes. The important thing is <a href="https://melanism.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cropped-header2013.jpg">don't cross the streams</a>. Unlike chocolate and peanut butter, these two flavors are not better together. Prematurely converging hinders your ability to produce ideas, and coming up with ideas distracts you from evaluating what you already have. Again, we'll go into some tools next time for how to successfully separate these.
</p>

<p>
Even though I'm sure you will start applying the above concepts all over the place already, there's another step for maximum effectiveness. If you point a group of people at a problem and say "Diverge then converge and come back to me with something great!" they're probably going to spend a lot of time spinning their wheels. To get around that, you need a process or framework that gives guidance on what to diverge on, and what criteria to use for convergence.

One of the best frameworks for teams is <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity</a>. It consists of an eight part problem solving cycle with divergence and convergence in each phase. It's remarkably effective for surfacing the best stuff from a group and generating creative solutions to problems with buy in from everyone on the team. I use it at work all the time, and I'm consistently amazed by what we we get when we use the process versus when we don't.
</p>

<p>
For individual creative pursuit, though, I find the Basadur approach a bit heavyweight. Instead, I prefer the framework laid out in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502990296&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">A Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. It is straightforward, actionable, and consistently produces individual insights when followed. Plus, you want to talk about bang for buck? This 42 page book will revolutionize how you work on your own creative projects. We'll talk through how to apply both of these frameworks next time.
</p>

<p>
We often overlook the last concept I want to talk about when we are thinking of creativity as an active pursuit: our <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/creative-output-requires-quality-inputs/#gs.WY=bvIM">inputs</a>. If you want to think well, you need things to think about, and those come from what you read, watch, hear, and do. Remember that our definition from last time emphasized the role of finding new connections between existing material in creativity. Your inputs determine both the existing material and the ideas for new connections you have to work with. We live in an age of near unlimited informational options, so next time I'll discuss some of the ways I like to make decisions about what inputs to seek out and experience.
</p>

<p>
As we talked about, creativity is a much discussed topic, so I've left out a number of interesting ideas and focused on the most essential. You could do worse than to check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">Wikipedia article</a> on creativity if you want to check out some stuff not covered here. I found the discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Affect">Affect</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#REM_sleep">Sleep</a> especially thought provoking. I was also fascinated by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502991782&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=where+good+ideas+come+from">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>, but it looks more at cultural and strategic ways to foster creativity - how does a society end up creative or what can someone do over the course of their life to cultivate creative insights, rather than "what can I do when I sit down with a specific problem today?" There's a lot of high quality thinking out there on creativity, and I look forward to revisiting the topic for a long time to come.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so I've laid out why Active Deferral of Judgement, Divergence/Convergence, Framework, and Inputs are the basic components of creativity. Next time we'll go through examples of how to actually apply each of these concepts, but even without that, you now how a powerful toolbox for thinking about and working with creativity.

<p>
This book might be the best "bang for the buck" I've ever seen - at 42 pages, you can easily read it in an evening and almost every single page is chock full of useful, actionable tips. It lays out the steps to follow in order to generate new, creative ideas. While it lacks some of the concepts we go through in our creativity series, it easily integrates with them. Do yourself a favor and check this out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-defining_creativity">

</p>

<p>
When I sat down to write a post about innovation, I quickly realized we had an unwieldy topic on our hands. So, instead of a single post on innovation and the future, I've decided to kick off a short series on creativity. To begin with, I'll provide my favorite definition of creativity and step through each piece of it and what it implies for applications down the road.
</p>

<p>
Just about anyone you talk to wants to be "more creative,"  but what does that really mean? There are <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/define-creativity/">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.basadur.com/insightsresearch/OurThoughtsonCreativityandInnovation/tabid/80/Default.aspx">different</a> ways to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creativity">define</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creativity</a>, and some of them are maddeningly vague or fluffy. Often, we associate creativity only with "artsy" pursuits like painting or poetry and assume that it doesn't apply to more hard-nosed disciplines. I think that nothing could be farther from the truth. So I've cobbled together various definitions in a way that is equally useful whether you are creating art or building a business: the ability to make useful new connections between concepts.
</p>

<p>
Let's start unpacking that definition, beginning with the core: making connections. We like to idealize creativity as conjuring something out of nothing, but really, to have new ideas, you have to have raw material. That's one reason why creativity requires voraciously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2pre2xnA1M">reading, watching, and listening to interesting and diverse material</a>. No one argues that being creative is just knowing about a bunch of different stuff, though. You gotta connect that stuff. That's one reason games, randomizers, and "oracles" can be so <a href="http://blog.creativethink.com/2007/01/use_a_random_id.html">useful for spurring creativity</a> - they force connections where none existed previously.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so if creativity is about making connections, the thing that makes those connections "creative" is that they are new. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">first time</a> someone noticed that cats and people and elephants have something in common with each other that they don't with snakes and lizards, that was creative. Noticing it today is not. We are all standing on the shoulders of everyone who has come before us, extending the network of associations further and further into conceptual space.  At first this can seem a bit intimidating, like everything really worthwhile has already been figured out. Here's the thing, though: because this network of connections that has been made, we have exponentially more raw material to work with than anyone else in the history of humanity. That's pretty awesome if you ask me. We're going to dive more into how lucky we really are when we talk about practical ways to be more creative in our own lives.
</p>

<p>
Finally, our new connections must also be useful. As we'll discuss later when we talk about specific techniques, it can actually hinder your ability to come up with stuff if start out too focused on "what's useful." That's just a phase in the process though, and the difference between <a href="http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/">brilliant and silly</a> is how much value people get out of the connection you have made for them. As we'll see when we dive into more "how to" later in the series, one of the most challenging things to do can be to allow ourselves to be silly at one phase while ruthlessly <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html">killing our darlings</a> later on.
</p>

<p>
We've stepped through why creativity is about connections, how those connections have to be new, and why they need to be useful to qualify as "creative". With this definition in mind, our future posts will get to the good stuff: practical advice to get you on the path to more creativity in your life and work.

<p>
If you spend as much time as I do listening to podcasts by Silicon Valley types, you've been hearing about this book for ages. I've been putting off reading it because I figured "well, I'm not starting a tech company, so it doesn't apply to me." Turns out that was a silly and limited way to think about the book. I ended up valuing it more for its discussion of the secrets that are the root of real economic value and its concepts of definite versus indefinite optimism. It was also the inspiration for the current series, as it talked about the importance of creativity and implementation in building the future world. It's a pretty quick read and well worth it.

<p>
<b>By Zhuang Zi, trans. Burton Watson</b>
</p>

<p>
This is an excerpt of the complete Zhuangzi, and I'm normally a rabid completionist, but there are three facts that lead me to recommend this edition: 1. This is the version I had in my physical library and therefore read, 2. The translator makes a pretty good case that what is excluded is mostly later (less awesome) additions to the work of the original author, and 3. you can get this excerpt for about one third of the price of the complete works. So, with that in mind, let me tell you what's great about this book. It's a lot more lively than most philosophy, featuring poetry, metaphor, and humor. I found it almost as valuable as a demonstration of an alternative way to convey deep, important ideas as I did for the actual ideas it was discussing. It's also interestingly different from the Daoism you may know from the <i>Daodejing</i>. I'm not going to get a Yin-Yang symbol tattooed on me anytime soon, but I have found this a worthwhile addition to my mental tool kit.

<i><p>A Note on Spelling Conventions - Skip if you are not a language nerd:</p>

<p>Since westerners started studying Chinese, they have tried to get around the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to render it. For years the most popular way was the “Wade-Giles System,” which uses various letter combinations as kludges to represent tones. It is a clever way to operate within the constraints of existing letters, but if you don’t know the code, you’re gonna say everything wrong.</p>

<p>More recently, the People’s Republic of China has introduced the pinyin system. The key feature of which is the use of diacritic marks to indicate tones, which is incredibly useful for ignorant westerners like me. With this, you can be much more straightforward in your use of letters, so even if you get the tones wrong, you’re at least getting the rest right. Because of this, I have decided to ditch the Wade-Giles spellings familiar from my youth and use pinyin without the diacritics (because they are a pain in the ass on an English keyboard).</p></i>

<p>
I decided to take advantage of my vacation in China to read some Chinese philosophy in the land that gave it birth. Looking over my bookshelf, I noticed a book I had purchased for a college class - Zhuangzi. In the class we only read a tiny excerpt, and ever since it’s been on my “meaning to read” list. So I ended up pulling it out of my bag and digging in while floating through a landscape that looks exactly like a Chinese landscape painting. 
</p>

<p>
First off, let’s provide a bit of context. “Zhuangzi” can refer to both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou">philosopher</a> (“Master Zhuang”) or to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">work ascribed to him</a> (but probably containing material added later by other people as well). Besides the semi-mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Laozi</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Daodejing</a>, Zhuangzi is the next most foundational work in Daoism. The philosopher was a rough contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a>’s in the 4th century BCE. Both of these eminent gentlemen helped to define the explosion of thinking known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought">“The Hundred Schools of Thought”</a>. In terms of influence on later philosophy, this time period is roughly analogous to the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy">Hellenisitic age</a> in the west  - a flowering of different approaches that are still discussed, debated, and even followed today. This author of Zhuangzi used this context by telling stories featuring members of other schools of thought - sometimes showing them as fellow seekers of wisdom and other times mercilessly parodying them and their hang ups. 
</p>

<p>
One of the things that struck me in the book was the similarity of the core of the philosophy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Zhuangzi essentially argues that the world is constantly changing and the only way to not be perturbed by this is align yourself with that change, which is an expression of the universal Way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Dao</a>). Despite some important differences, the core idea that we can’t control circumstances, but we can control how we react to them, will sound familiar to students of the two schools I mentioned. I will have to reread the <i>Daodejing</i>, but I don’t remember such a clear parallel there. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that such a useful and life-changing mental hack was independently discovered in multiple places. 
</p>

<p>
Which is by no means to say that <i>Zhuangzi</i> is simply a rehash of things you can find elsewhere. It is widely renowned for its imagery, poetry, and imaginative use of metaphor. Some of these struck me as simply bizarre, but many were rather beautiful. One of these poetic sections has become more famous in the west than the book that spawned it: Zhuangzi is the sage who dreamed he was a butterfly and then wondered if he were not a butterfly dreaming of being a man. Besides the imagery, the other ingredient in Zhuangzi’s secret sauce is humor, and there were several times where I would slowly smile or even chuckle as I realized something that I thought was “serious business” was actually the set up for an elaborate joke. When you put these two stylistic traits together, you get a very interesting effect: since you never know exactly where the author stands moment to moment, or even necessarily what he actually means, you have to think for yourself. You can neither buy everything he says uncritically nor dismiss him as someone you disagree with unconditionally. It’s a remarkably effective way to convey something experientially instead of didactically.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate this dynamic produced by humor, metaphor, and active engagement, let me share my favorite example. Zhuangzi frequently praises the “useless” and denigrates the “useful.” One image he uses is a <a href="http://mjglass.ca/metaphor/uselesstree.htm">gigantic tree</a> that has only been allowed to get so big because no part of it has any usefulness to humans - which would have gotten it cut down or plucked or such like. He similarly points out that useful people get put to work and sometimes even get killed doing that work, and so argues it’s good to be crippled and deformed. I was finding it hard to swallow the whole “useless is good, useful is bad” line of reasoning until one <a href="https://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu3.html#26">striking metaphor</a> got me:
</p>

<p>
"A man has to understand the useless before you can talk to him about the useful. The earth is certainly vast and broad, though a man uses no more of it than the area he puts his feet on. If, however, you were to dig away all the earth from around his feet until you reached the Yellow Springs, then would the man still be able to make use of it?"
</p>

<p>
I had a koan-like flash of insight reading this about all of the other images I had been reading. If not for that moment, I might have written the whole work off as anti-rational nonsense. For you, the “click” might come somewhere else because of a different interaction of the imagery, humor, and your own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Though I still find the <i>Daodejing</i> more relevant, Zhuangzi’s skepticism and anti-authoriatarianism was a welcome breath of fresh air in the sometimes puzzling field of Daoism, and gave me a wider understanding of the philosophy than I previously had. It also opened my mind to alternative ways to convey philosophical truths. If you have made previous forays into Chinese philosophy and found them dull or staid, perhaps you should give <i>Zhuangzi</i> a try.

<b>By Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland</b>
</p>

<p>
Neal Stephenson is probably my favorite living author, and so I buy anything with his name on it no questions asked. I tore through this on my recent flight to Beijing and rather enjoyed it. A shadowy government organization discovers that magic used to be real but doesn't work anymore, and then figures out a way to make it work again to send people back in time. A fun read that touches on all of the exciting possibilities of magic, time travel, and quantum physics. Not as many detailed asides as a pure Stephenson book, but that means that it keeps moving at a brisk pace the whole time. Give it a shot if the idea of mashing up fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction gets you all hot and bothered.

This one didn't quite make it on to my <a href="#my_operating_manuals_for_life">list of operating manuals</a>, in part because I just finished it a week or two ago and I'm not sure how much of an impact it's had on me yet. It might sound hopelessly like positive thinking hippy dippy crap, but I've been getting more and more convinced about the power of auto-suggestion, in part because of the Scott Adams <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/persuasion-reading-list-updated-1-18/">persuasion reading list</a> I've mentioned before.

For example, I'm not a big fan of James Altucher anymore, as my further exposure to him has made him seem scammy and dishonest. So while there's nothing in the</i> Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth <i>that seems obviously bad or wrong, I don't trust it as a whole anymore.

<p>
The most recent edition to my collection, a month or two back my friend was like “you need to read this right now,” and he was right. James Altucher argues three main points in the book: secure corporate employment for your entire life is dead and gone, it’s up to you to bring value to the world, and the best way to do that is to follow a daily practice that nourishes and improves yourself mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. He supplements all of this with a number of specific techniques on freelancing, selling, networking, and so forth. Some of the books on this list had already laid the groundwork for believing that financial success comes from no other source than me, but this book gave me the tactical kick in the butt I needed to start acting.

<p>
Equal parts manifesto and field guide, Cal Newport argues that focusing on one thing at a time and choosing important, hard work is a super power in a world of constant distraction. My own experience bears this out - when I most seriously follow the approach explained in this book, not only do I get more work done, I feel more fulfilled and happier about it to boot. This book is essential reading if you want to achieve mastery in anything or even just stand out from your peers at work.

<b>By Joshua Waitzkin</b>

<p>
One of the more challenging books on this list. I have revisited it multiple times, and every time I find a new insight I didn’t pick up before. Waitzkin has thought deeply and internalized several principles on learning and performance at the highest levels through his experience as a child chess master, world champion Tai Chi Push Hands competitor, top tier Brazilian Jiu Jitsu trainer, and a coach for the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. At times bordering on the mystical and opaque, you have to do your own share of the work with this book. Rather than concrete, actionable strategies, this book deals in fundamental principles that are relevant no matter the strategy you choose: which can be frustrating at times, but is more rewarding and useful in the long run.

Another book that doesn’t present easy, pre-digested material. We’ve talked about it somewhat extensively before.

It’s another book where I find something new and get smarter every time I revisit it.

The only novel on this list, but don’t let that fool you - it’s still loaded to the gills with insight and useful introspective tools.

I agree with more of it every time I come back to it, and it has also been my personal bridge between stoicism and eastern philosophy - a more compatible pairing than you might think.

The shortest book here, it punches way over its weight. I first read it cover to cover on an hour long flight and it lit my mind on fire. If you have anything remotely creative inside you trying to get out, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It is uncomfortable and galvanizing at the same time - like a cold shower, you will flinch from it at first, but emerge ready to take on the world. It is medicine I take whenever I find myself getting lazy and complacent.

A quick note on translations: these last two books were obviously not written in English, and the translation you select will have a big impact on what you think of it - generally stay away from
the free Kindle editions, as these tend to be old, public domain translations of mediocre quality. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of why I chose these translations, shoot me an email and we can geek out.

<p>
My personal favorite work of stoic philosophy, it barely edged out Marcus Aurelius for my token Stoic book. Stoicism is such a central part of my personal philosophy that I could have easily chosen nothing but stoic books. Here’s a good overview of stoicism generally, but at the core of it are three men, each impressive in his own way: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.  While I appreciate all of them, turns out I’m a Seneca guy. It is shocking how modern and relevant his 2,000 year old letters feel. Writing to a young friend and protege, Seneca’s advice has the wisdom and clarity of an older mentor who has been there, wishes he had done better, and now advises his young friend to learn from his experience. Friendly, worldly, but with an unceasing dedication to living a good life, these letters are good for you.

Based on the rest of the list, this may come as something of a surprise entry, but I find the myths in it both beautiful and meaningful. The Germanic myths lack the neat and tidy systemization imposed on Greek myth, leaving them with a raw vitality and tantalizingly missing pieces. With all my focus on rational stoicism and conscious improvement, I find it useful to remember the murkier subconscious parts of my mind that can only be accessed through stories of gods, monsters, and magic. Plus they’re viking myths so they’re super metal. If you’re still not convinced and insist on directly useful, you’ll find fewer collections of wisdom poetry more straightforward than the Havamal.

I know that there’s quite a lot to read here, but these are special and well worth the time. I encourage you to pick just one new book and give it a go today. It just might change your life.

I started reading this book because I've encountered the idea of managing "energy" in several places, and I wanted an adequate description to work with. This book did not disappoint. As I read, I kept thinking "this reminds me of Josh Waitzkin's advice in The Art of Learning", so I went back and checked, and sure enough, he trained with the authors. While the physical and emotional energy stuff is useful, I found this work's definition of  "spiritual" as "caring about something larger than yourself beyond your own self-interest" to be the most straightforward and practical definition I've encountered. A lot of ideas from this book have been incorporated elsewhere, but it's full of specific case studies and examples of how the concepts have been applied in a variety of situations. Great stuff.

I've been wanting to read this book ever since listening to James Altucher's <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/podcast/steven-johnson/">interview with the author</a> and it did not disappoint. Wide ranging and diverse in the best possible way, this book draws on examples as diverse as the building of coral reefs and the founding of YouTube to elucidate the components of systems that most reliably produce useful innovation - whether in nature, science, or business. I would have liked just a hair more advice on how to operationalize the concepts, but as a foundation for thinking about hard problems that matter, this book was invaluable.

This book came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine at work and it certainly did not disappoint. It focuses on questions of how objects in our environment can enhance (or detract) from our experience and our lives. Most useful to me was the distinction between <i>affordances</i> and <i>signifiers</i> and the notion of "knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world." If you're even a little bit interested in how the objects, structures, and organizations around you shape your life in subtle ways, you'll thoroughly enjoy this.

I'm not gonna lie to you, friends: I was pretty skeptical of this system when I first heard about it at work. One of my business school professors engrained a deep distrust of "personality types" in general by pointing out that almost all of them except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">The Big Five</a> lack any rigorous empirical testing. That being said, as I read this book, time and again I saw descriptions that rang extremely true for either myself or my loved ones. It's probably easy to take this too far and use it as some kind of universal theory, but it makes an awfully useful heuristic for understanding why you act the way you do, and more importantly, why other people act in such seemingly incomprehensible ways.

<p>
<a href="#rethinking_risk_with_antifragile">Last time</a>, we discussed a new way of looking at the concept of “risk” and our inability to scientifically define it. Today, we go a little deeper and break systems into three categories based on their exposure to volatility: fragile, robust, and antifragile.
</p>

<p>
First we need to realize that volatility, time, and risk are really the same thing. This sounds bizarre, right? But let’s return to our <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rationality.pdf">least-worst definition of risk</a>: “exposure to negative outcomes brought about by volatility." With this in mind, we can see that given enough time, every possible extreme of volatility will be experienced. To return to our coffee mug example, if you leave that mug on a table in San Francisco, eventually an earthquake will knock it off and break it. So, the combination of its exposure to negative outcomes (falls make it break) plus time (eventually something will happen to knock it off) means that more time equals more likely that it is broken. I should point out, of course, that this concept is statistical and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical">empirical</a> in nature, which has three important implications: 1)it is only really valid probabilistically, 2) it can’t predict the outcome for any one single thing, and 3) it makes no theory-based claims as to why time will eventually break most coffee mugs. 
</p>

<p>
We now know that exposure is the most practical thing to care about, since it definitely matters and we can actually observe it. Contrast this with the other elements of “risk” usually considered - the timing or intensity of the outcomes concerned, which we can’t every really know ahead of time. WIth our focus squarely on exposure, we can now look at how to categorize systems based on exposure, and It turns out that there are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile. The first two will be familiar and intuitively obvious, but this last category is novel and thus gives Taleb’s book its name. Let’s go through what each category means and give some examples.
</p>

<p>
Fragile things are hurt by volatility - eventually something goes wrong and they break. The easy example we’ve been using is the coffee mug. An important concept that we’ve skipped over so far is that these categories are defined by their relationship with volatility, which can be changed by circumstances - it’s not an intrinsic quality, even though some things more inherently tend towards fragility than others. 
</p>

<p>
To understand this distinction, I like to think about <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy">potential energy</a>. A brick sitting on top of a ladder has more potential energy than one sitting on the ground. Nothing about the brick changes except its relationship with the gravity well it’s sitting in. Likewise, with our coffee mug, if you wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuffed it in a box, put that box in a waterproof bag, then put that inside a nuke proof bunker filled with packing peanuts, it would be significantly less fragile than sitting on your coffee table, which is less fragile still than balancing on top of a stack of books as you try to open a door.
</p>

<p>
The most relevant real world examples are traditional stocks and artificial systems that are overly optimized. Sure, traditional stocks go up when volatility goes in their favor, but they go down when it goes down, and you need <a href="http://www.360financialliteracy.org/Topics/Budgeting-Spending/Budgeting-and-Saving/Understanding-the-Math-of-Recovering-from-Losses">bigger growth to offset your loss</a>. Highly optimized systems, on the other hand, work great until they catastrophically don’t. These failures are usually due to an unforeseen change in environmental circumstance or an excess of predicted capacity. Traffic is a great example. Highways don’t get linearly slower as cars are added during rush hour - they go from zooming to standstill exponentially quickly as their capacity is exceeded. If you like guns, think about the (somewhat exaggerated) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16">difference between an M16 and an AK-47</a>: an M16 is more accurate and generally higher functioning, but stops working after much less abuse than the less optimized, cruder AK.
</p>

<p>
So, the AK-47 can be described as “more robust” or “less fragile” than the M16. Robust is usually considered the opposite of fragile, but that’s not quite accurate. Robust things are indifferent to volatility - shit happens and they abide. Volatility neither particularly hurts nor particularly helps them. Think of <a href="http://s1.thingpic.com/images/u3/z7gW8yQ1gQAjKqq9Vmgcf47e.jpeg">Notre Dame</a> in Paris - through centuries of wars, invasions, and revolutions, it has remained beautiful and solid and standing. Sure it’s a little rougher around the edges, but it’s not a pile of rubble. Nor is it larger or more beautiful or superior in some way. It simply is.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to examples of increasing robustness in day to day life, I like to think about my finances and my schedule. As I mentioned before, I keep somewhat large cash savings around, because it makes me more indifferent to volatility. I can pay for the unexpected without indebting myself or scrambling around. Likewise, when scheduling, I build in buffers of time (a trick I originally learned in the army) so that if something unexpected happens (major accident on the freeway, a train stops traffic, there’s a marathon I didn’t know about - whatever) I still get there on time. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we get to the star of the show, the most novel category: antifragile, the true opposite of fragile. Antifragile systems actually benefit from volatility - eventually something will happen that makes them better or stronger. These systems are most often found in nature. Think of your immune system: once you have chicken pox, you’re immune. Or your muscles: lift weights and you get stronger. Most interesting of all, look at evolution: species and even ecosystems get more efficient and better adapted to their environment over time by responding to the various stressors that come up due to volatility.
</p>

<p>
Because this is exciting and sounds like a super power, everyone immediately thinks “how can I be more antifragile?” Well, there’s good and bad news. First off, the bad news is that it is more applicable to systems than to individual entities. The good news is that we create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">systems</a> in our life constantly, and we can engineer those to be as antifragile as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Taleb became wealthy by betting against the market with out of the money put options - when the financial crisis hit and the market tanked, those options paid off. He had no precise knowledge of when a crash would happen or how big it would be, but given enough time it would. So he constructed a system with <a href="http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf">convex exposure</a> where he accepted finite, limited downside constantly for near unlimited upside in the event of volatility. 
</p>

<p>
For ourselves, it helps to remember that robust is usually a necessary stepping stone to antifragile. Remember the savings we talked about? Step 1 is you don’t care about negative outcomes. Step 2 is to create ways to actively benefit from them - such as by buying undervalued stocks when there is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp">“blood in the streets”</a> or setting up positions that automatically benefit like Taleb’s. Or you might find other ways that disorder in your life can benefit you - have something read or listen to whenever you find yourself unexpectedly delayed, for example. Another favorite of mine is to practice Jocko Willink’s habit of responding to all negative situations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8">“Good.”</a> Or perhaps, invest in business ideas that take advantage of the seemingly negative, like staffing agencies in a world of <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/quit-your-job-2017/">declining full time employment</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The basics of Taleb’s framework come pretty easy, but there is so much depth there. For example, I didn’t even touch the <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/taleb_n_1.html">math</a> behind it, because that’s not my forte. I promise that as you think about these concepts, you will begin seeing them in your life and trying to find ways to apply them. If you figure out anything interesting, please let me know!

<p>
The core concept explored in this book is what is "risk" and how should we think about it in our lives, but it reaches out and touches so many more areas of interest. Taleb is shockingly smart, enjoyably contrarian, and writes in a very engaging way. This book is one of my top five life and brain changing books - you will be a little bit smarter every time you read it.

<p>
Risk fundamentally shapes some of our most critical decisions, but most of us don’t think very deeply or clearly about it. <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Taleb</a> is not like most of us. he has thought long, hard, and with great rigor about risk and randomness, and he presents that thinking most usefully and straightforwardly in Antifragile. That being said, while his writing and storytelling are superb, it’s not exactly light beach reading. Below we’re going to talk about just one of the many useful concepts presented in the book, which is a fundamentally different way to think about and evaluate risk.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/4orcemajeure/the-james-altucher-show-ep-45-nassim-taleb-why-you-should-embrace-uncertainty">his interview with James Altucher</a> recently, and I was surprised to realize I haven’t written about this book yet. You see, it lives on my shelf of “personal operating manuals” along with <i>Deep Work</i>, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <i>Tools of Titans</i>, and a few others. I am pretty sure that <i>Antifragile</i> is the “80/20” book of his <i>Incerto</i> series - it covers the key concepts, ways to apply them to your life, and just enough of the underlying math to let you know it’s serious (there’s more in the appendix if that gets you going). 
</p>

<p>
Understanding Antifragile requires rethinking the term “risk.” First off, Taleb asserts that there is no such thing as a satisfactory definition of “risk.” Risk as usually defined or described conflates three separate factors - the likelihood of an event, a party’s exposure to that likelihood, and how that party feels about that exposure. Usually you’ll see risk <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html">defined</a> as something like “the likelihood of a negative outcome times its severity.”
</p>

<p>
One problem with this is that “negative outcome” and “severity” can vary enormously depending on the entity experiencing the event. If your coffee cup is knocked off the counter, it’s going to have a bad time. If your cat falls off the counter, it’ll be fine. In both cases the objective event (falling off the counter) is identical, but the entities experiencing it are differently exposed to negative outcomes. When you add in rational thought, you get the further wrinkle that “negative” is a judgment call. While you might think something like “losing money” is intrinsically negative, it’s not so simple. What if I lose money daily but get a huge payout once a year and I’m okay with that? Or what if I decide I’m okay losing the money to have a good time (like a Vegas trip)? 
</p>

<p>
There’s an even thornier challenge besides those above, though: outside of certain fairly constrained bounds, we can’t even accurately model the likelihood of events (we think we can, but we’re very bad at it). Artificial environments that involve chance (like rolling dice or drawing cards) have relatively easy to model probabilities, as do large classes of natural phenomena that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-most-natural-phenomena-when-observed-randomly-tend-to-converge-to-a-normal-distribution-curve-If-so-can-this-be-used-as-a-hypothesis-to-claim-that-nature-follows-a-certain-pattern">fit pretty well</a> into normal distributions. But several classes of events that matter very much to our lives (financial instruments, catastrophic disasters, terrorist attacks, et cetera) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e6UKCJt-g8">cannot have their probability modeled in any meaningful, non-deceiving way</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So where does that leave us for how to think about risk in our own lives? Well, the good news is that while we can’t really nail down a scientific definition of “risk” for the whole wide world, we can do just fine in assessing risk for ourselves. To do so, we need to look at two main factors: how we feel about the outcomes and our exposure to those outcomes taking place. For example, I would very much like to continue living and would find getting killed unambiguously negative. Certain activities, like smoking, riding motorcycles, or going to dangerous neighborhoods dramatically increase my exposure to the outcome of getting killed. I don’t have to have a good model of how likely or unlikely those outcomes are to simply avoid my exposure to that risk.
</p>

<p>
In terms of personal finance, I keep a lot more cash savings than most investing professionals would advise, because savings help make me more robust - I can be more indifferent to the volatility of the world around me. Air conditioning stops working? Cool, I’ve got cash in the bank. Surprise! Nail in your tire - cash. You get the picture. Now, this works the other way as well - you can take some amount of money that you’re okay with losing and invest it in things with a low chance of paying off but with potentially unlimited returns, like out of the money options or start ups or your own entrepreneurial ventures. Taleb calls this the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads">“barbell method”</a> of investing, because he advocates having heavily safe and heavily risky investments, rather than an averaged portfolio like a business school finance class would teach you to go for.
</p>

<p>
This may come as a shock to you, but I also find Tim Ferriss’s definition of risk instructive to combine here - he looks at risk by asking whether or not something irreversible and/or massively negative may happen. By using <a href="http://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/">fear setting</a> to mitigate what you can of the likelihood and alter your perception of the negatives, you will often find that very few actions have truly irreversible massive negative outcomes. This attitude can make it easier to expose yourself to the possible upsides of volatility, such as by encouraging you to build your own business or invest a prudent amount in a highly speculative company. 
</p>

<p>
So how do you apply these concepts? We’ve talked about a few in our examples above, but here’s my top pics for most useful ways to re-think your approach to risk in your life:
</p>

<p>
Career: Corporate jobs are generally viewed as “safe” because there is very little volatility in your paycheck. Until it’s totally gone. Maybe you get laid off, or maybe you happened to be working for Enron. If this happens when you’re 23, it’s not such a big deal, but if it happens right before retirement, it can be devestating. Compare this with a skilled individual worker or independent consultant, and their pay is much more variable day to day and month to month, but they have a much tighter feedback loop: as long as you keep getting clients, you’re doing something valuable. When you start losing your ability to find them, it’s a sign you need to move on and find a new gig. 
</p>

<p>
Investing: Before we get into this, please bear in mind I am not an investment advisor of any sort, and this does not constitute specific financial advice - this paragraph is just a recommendation on where to look to learn more, not specific investment strategies. As mentioned above, a traditionally balanced portfolio basically says “let’s get rid of all the volatility except what’s inherent in the market.” The trouble is, there’s a whole damn lot of volatility inherent in the market, especially when you are looking only at equity. Much better to figure out however much money you need to not be ruined and protect it from volatility the best you can (Inflation-protected Treasuries or the like) and take whatever is left over and put it into things where you have exposure to the potential for massive upside - investing in your friend’s genius start up, opening a restaurant, writing a novel, out of the money options, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
Health and Behavior: There are some things that can greatly affect our exposure to negative health outcomes - like the previously mentioned smoking or engaging in dangerous stunts. Many of these you can completely opt out of and face no risk - which is the approach recommended by Taleb. You’ll have to decide for yourself if a non-zero chance of horrible death is worth the benefits of doing things like motorcycle riding or sky diving. On the more positive side, doing things like lifting heavy weights and walking frequently have close to zero downside (some chance of injury with weight lifting), but potentially tremendous upside to your health long term. 
</p>

<p>
This is just the tip of the iceberg with Taleb’s material, and I strongly recommend you check out not only Antifragile, but the rest of the Incerto series. We haven’t even gotten into just what “Antifragility” is, but I wanted to cover the basic approach to risk and provide some tangible ways to use it first. Let me know if you’re interested in diving deeper on this topic, and we’ll make a series of it.

The core thesis of this book is that <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull/">goals are for losers, systems are for winners, and passion is bullshit</a>. When I finally got around to actually reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely jam packed with useful little nuggets. Seriously, this is one of the highest "actionable stuff to fluff" self-improvement books I've ever read. While it is full of specific tactics, the real value of this book is how it points out the complex system that leads to your energy, output, and ultimately success.

I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but to be perfectly honest, I was worried it was one of those books where if you know the premise you don't need to read it. What I had overlooked is the degree to which making the case for checklists would motivate me to actually change my behavior. The examples given of lives saved and fortunes made through the seemingly simple expedient of using checklists are quite impressive. Plus, there's a neat checklist for creating your own checklist in the back.

This book might seem out of left field for those of you outside of the military or law enforcement, but I think it has several valuable lessons for everybody. First off, it will help you to understand many of the dynamics going on - on both sides - of the deadly force encounters you hear about in the news. Secondly, it's breakdown of the physical, psychological, and environmental factors of the most extreme kind of stress can be reverse-engineered to the more mild kinds of stress most of us are lucky enough to deal with. Finally, it just might help you prepare for unlikely but terrible life-threatening situations.

I've been a fan of Ferriss for years, but I think this book is far and away his best yet. It's chock full of great stuff that you can use right now to make your life better - whether to get healthy, make money, or feel more calm in your life. If you only ever read one book of his, make it this one. Hell, if you only read one self-improvement book period, make it this one.

This book is a classic for a reason - I've taken my sweet ass time getting to it, but I am absolutely hooked. Drawing on a combination of scholarly experiments and "in the trenches" experience with sales training, this book points out thenearly automatic triggers we have evolved to be good, cooperative members ofsociety and how "compliance professionals" (salesmen, recruiters, and cons) use these techniques to get their way without you even knowing what they're about. This book is doubly valuable - you learn how to spot unscrupulous applications of the techniques as well as how to use them in your own (hopefully legitimate) endeavors. For lots of interesting extra context, check out Scott Adams's <a href="http://goldmine.marketing/scott-adams-original-persuasion-reading-list-from-2016/">Persuasion Reading List</a>.

By now, you've probably heard about how bad sitting is for you, and maybe you've even seen or used a standing desk somewhere. Well, this book lays down the case for why sitting is literally killing us in stark, terrifying detail, and proceeds to provide specific, step by step instructions on how to do something about it. It's not as simple as buying a standing desk and burning your chair - you have to re-teach your body appropriate ways of moving after years oflearning the wrong thing. Fortunately, the prescriptions in this book are easy to follow and will give you immediate relief as well as long-lasting solutions to problems like stiff backs, joint pain, and chronic stress.

In this book, Harris makes a case for spiritual practice without the scaffolding and foundation of religious beliefs. While he approaches it as an avowed and enthusiastic atheist, I think that the core insight that there are certain practices you can adopt to bring peace, contentment, and compassion into your life without adopting beliefs you are uncomfortable with is useful regardless of your religious convictions. The descriptions of what it feels like to meditate and what it feels like to think you're meditating when you aren't really are worth the price of admission by themselves.

My name is Jeff Russell. This webstead is my home on the internet. I plan to share my thoughts on the many things I'm interested in. Hopefully you'll find them interesting too.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've had somewhat sundered "selves" on the web - I had a blog and social media account for gaming, another blog and webstead for coaching and thoughts on business and getting more work done and such, and I've lurked around reading but not putting out there my interests in things like philosophy, magic, and religion. After listening to Naval Ravikant <a href="https://nav.al/rich">talk about</a> why you want to welcome and make the most out of what you have that no one else does, and to Josh Waitzkin <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/06/19/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-distilled/">talk about</a> how greatness comes from "embracing your funk", I made up my mind to set that right - hence, here we are, with one stead to put all of those many interests.  
</p>

<p>
This webstead is largely built following the advice in <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed to Last</a> by Jeff Huang. That's why almost everything is on one page, the formatting is minimal, and the html/css is as simple and vanilla as I can make it.
