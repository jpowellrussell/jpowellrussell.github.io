<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-25
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned last time, I thought I had put forth what I was up to coming up with a "Heathen Rosary", but it turns out I hadn't, so I thought "why not now?"
</p>

<p>
First off, it might be helpful to say what I mean by a "Heathen Rosary", since that could mean rather a few unalike things. In <i>Pagan Prayer Beads</i> by John Michael Greer and 'Clare Vaughn' (his wife's pen name for this work), they use "rosary" for any set of prayers tied to a set of prayer beads. Galina Krasskova <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/05/retooling-the-rosary/">"retooled" the rosary</a> with a set of prayers meant to be said on a set of beads made for the Christian Rosary and with the intent of keeping much of the rhythm of the Christian prayer, because she grew up around it and it was a foundational part of her early exposure to religious practice. My own take is somewhere in between these. I have never been Catholic, and the Rosary has never been a part of my spiritual practice. That being said, through prayer, meditation, and divination, I got the impression that I ought to come up with a prayer that takes advantage of much of what works well for the Christian Rosary, while still being customized for my own beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I got the idea I ought to work out a prayer that is "like the rosary", and to make that happen, I decided I ought to learn more about the Christian Rosary. As such, I've been reading through the prayers of Rosary and some works about it. From this reading, the thing that has struck me most strongly is the Rosary's alternation between familiarity/repetition and novelty. Also, the Christian Rosary has a strong alternation of praying to the masculine and feminine aspects of the Catholic religion. So, I've been trying to work out how to get the best of these traits in a regular prayer without calling upon Christian religious figures.
</p>

<p>
So, what I've come to is the <a href="#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Framework for a Heathen Rosary</a>. I'm still working out what the saying of intent and closing of each "group" of "Hail Iduns" should be, along with what the equivalent of the mysteries might be. My end goal is to have a set of prayers that share the Christian Rosary's balance between repetition and novelty, depth of theological ground covered, and alternation between masculine and feminine holy Beings, but that are said to the Gods and Goddesses I worship. On the contemplation side, I think that I will use Germanic myths, one myth in place of each "mystery", but I don't yet know how to group them. Divination has led me to make my beads with four sets of nine, and the main thread tying together the prayers, myth, and symbolism is the World Tree, Yggdrasil, but I'm still not entirely sure how to put all of that together. I'm also not sure how many groups of myths/mysteries to have, but I'm thinking maybe one for each of the Wyrds, or one for each day of the week, or one for each of the nine worlds, or something. I might have to start grouping myths together into groups of four and see how many meaningful categories I can infer.
</p>

<p>
Once I'm through all of this, I'd like to have a set of prayers I can say daily with associated contemplative material that will stand as a fairly compact, but also fairly complete, devotional practice. I'll share more here as I actually work it out!

<h2 id="framework_for_a_heathen_rosary" class="Post">Framework for a Heathen Rosary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-18
</p>

<p>
I started writing this post thinking that I had already introduced my goal of coming up with a "Heathen Rosary," but looking back, it seems I only briefly mentioned it in my <a href="#the_hail_idun_prayer">"Hail Idun"</a> post. So here's the short version: the Rosary is a longstanding contemplative prayer that has been spiritually valuable to a lot of folks all around the world and for a very long time. As such, it seems like a good model for coming up with a contemplative prayer in keeping with my own beliefs. Through prayer, meditation, and just plain thinking about it, I've come to a rough idea of what that prayer might look like, but I've still got a lot of work to do.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to be further along in working this set of prayers out by this point, but since I'm not, I thought I'd share what I do have so far. I haven't written out any of the prayers other than the "Hail Idun" Prayer, but I've gotten some idea of the shape those prayers will take.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A Saying of Intent</li>
<li>Open each group of prayers with a prayer to Woden</li>
<li>Say Nine "Hail Iduns"</li>
<li>Close each group with a prayer that again affirms relatedness with the beings of the world</li>
<li>Repeat for four groups</li>
<li>Close with another saying of striving to live well</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you know the Christian Rosary, this pretty closely follows the framework there. That collection of prayers opens with the Apostle's Creed, has 5 groups of prayers (Decades), each of which begins with an "Our Father" and is made up of 10 repetitions of the "Hail Mary", and closes with a "Glory Be." At the end of the whole prayer is a closing prayer. The big difference in my group of prayers, other than praying to different spiritual beings, is that the opening and closing are less statements of <i>belief</i>, and more a statement of <i>intent</i>. For Christianity, stating what you believe to be true about the world is an important foundation of religious practice. Germanish religion, on the other hand, like most many-Godded beliefs, puts far more weight on what you <i>do</i> and how you relate to the Gods. As such, rather than a "creed", I plan to open with a statement of intention to live well and do right by the Gods, and for the closing prayer to reiterate this idea.
</p>

<p>
Having nine "Hail Iduns" was a pretty obvious choice, given the prominence of 9 as a holy number in Germanish belief, but it was harder to figure out how many groups of prayers to say. I've come down on four groups for now, mostly because it is pretty close to the 5 groups of the Christian Rosary, but there are more instances of "fours" in Germanish myth than "fives". I haven't yet worked out how many groups of themes for contemplation (the "Mysteries" in the Christian tradition) to use, but I'm leaning toward using myths as the themes, and possibly grouping into three groups, such as the "Wyrd Mysteries, Werthende Mysteries, and the Schuld Mysteries."
</p>

<p>
Another element that I think is quietly implicit in the Christian Rosary but that I intend to emphasize pretty heavily is the alternation between prayers to a masculine power and to a feminine power. In Christianity, that's Jesus and Mary, and for me, that will mainly be Woden and Idun. I think that this interplay of masculine and feminine is essential to how this particular set of prayers works, but it might also be influenced by Christianity being otherwise so heavily oriented toward the masculine. The other complicating factor is that the Christian theological world is comparatively simple compared to most polytheistic understandings of the world - you cover pretty much all of your theological bases by affirming the Trinity and then praying to God the Father in the way Jesus taught, and by affirming Jesus's role even in the prayers to Mary.
</p>

<p>
For a polytheist, getting the same sense of praying to "everything overall" is much harder (and perhaps not needed?). In my case, I am seeing the unifying factor as the Tree of Life, Yggdrassil, and the relationships between the Gods, spirits, and other beings that it represents as what to call upon for "the whole holy world". I might also bring the Wyrds (Norns) into either the replacement for the "Glory Be" and/or the closing prayer. While specific divine beings, they are also embodiments of the workings of the universe and are connected with the Tree.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm planning on writing prayers for each of these pieces following a traditional Germanish meter (likely "Anglo-Saxon Long Lines"), and I'll share them here as I get them written. As always, any thoughts or feedback are welcome.

<h2 id="looking_into_the_our_father" class="Post">Looking Into the "Our Father"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-looking_into_the_our_father">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-21
</p>

<p>
After my <a href="#lessons_learned_on_prayer_from_the_council_of_trent">earlier post</a> on the Catechism of the Council of Trent about the section "On Prayer", I went ahead and read through the rest of the section, which is a line-by-line treatment of the "Our Father". The catechism uses this prayer as an example of a single, sufficient prayer for Christian practice. While I am not a Christian, I find the thought of having one prayer that is a wholly sufficient baseline an especially interesting one, and I thought that it would be helpful to look in detail at what the Council of Trent had to say about the "Our Father". 
</p>

<p>
Since I'm not a Christian, my main interest is in thinking through what crafting such a prayer for another faith might mean. Of course, I'm especially interested in coming up with such a prayer for my own faith, but to try to make this helpful for others, I'd like to generalize as much as possible.  Lastly, though much of the prayer is particularly Christian, there is much within the prayer that is inspiring and beautiful for any spiritual path, and might be worth thinking through how to emulate in other faiths, and I'd like to highlight that as well.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6922a99" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6922a99">The Progression of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6922a99">
<p>
The Council of Trent broke down the prayer line-by-line and talked about what each line meant on its own, but also as a logical progression. The heart of it seems to be that you start universal, end universal, and have more particular asks sandwiched in-between. Each thing asked for also works both as a "plain" request for something obvious, and as a more sophisticated spiritual statement.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4a6b3ee" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4a6b3ee">Our Father, Who Art in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4a6b3ee">
<p>
The prayer begins by calling upon a loving father, not a harsh or distant lord. By specifying "our" father, the prayer also acknowledges that all men are brothers, and God is the father of all. Since Christians believe God to be everywhere, "Who art in Heaven" at first doesn't make much sense, but it serves to draw attention to the noblest part of visible nature, the sky, and asks those praying to compare that with God. More personally, by placing the highly personal figure of a "father" in the highly spiritual locale of "heaven", the prayer immediately establishes a link between personal practice and the transcendental goods sought through spiritual practice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb17b5c4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb17b5c4">Hallowed Be Thy Name</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb17b5c4">
<p>
The Council of Trent recognizes that God's name can be nothing but hallowed in an abstract sense, but instead frames this bit of the prayer as a recognition, and a plea by the one praying to treat the name of God as holy. More subtly, the Council argues that all things that are good and hallowed are encompassed by God's name, and that this part of the prayer recognizes that. It also serves as a reminder to those praying to try to bring holiness to God's name through their actions outside of prayer, which will serve as an encouragement to any folks whose belief might be wavering.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga3e5012" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga3e5012">Thy Kingdom Come</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga3e5012">
<p>
The Council of Trent puts this forward as the highest possible good and says that it holds all other goods that might possibly be asked for - anything that might be truly good is actually a part of the Kingdom of God, and anything not a part of the Kingdom of God only seems good, but isn't truly so. This part of the prayer is meant to remind believers to notice how much better the goods of the Kingdom of Heaven are than the goods of this world, but also as an encouragement to bring as much of the Kingdom of God into the world as possible.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7553307" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7553307">Thy Will Be Done</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7553307">
<p>
This is one that is seemingly at first the most strongly associated with purely Christian theology, yet that maybe has useful lessons for other faiths as well. The core idea is that the one praying ought to acknowledge that what he thinks he wants might actually not be such a great idea, and instead that he should gladly accept what the God prayed to believes to be best. Christians justify this position with original sin - because you are fundamentally flawed and cut off from the Divine, whatever you will to happen is tainted, and so you should instead seek the will of the higher power, who is untainted. Even without original sin, though, you can pretty readily get to the idea that what we think is best might not have all the needed information. The world is a big, complicated place, and we are just some moderately clever social apes - why on earth would we think that we know what's best for us? If you believe in the idea of a God or Gods at all, you should trust that they know a bit better than we do, from our highly limited material points of view.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf3267f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcf3267f">On Earth as It Is in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcf3267f">
<p>
This bit was especially interesting to me, as I learned something I hadn't ever considered before: the Council of Trent says that "On Earth as It Is in Heaven" applies equally to "Hallowed be Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," and "Thy will be done." I had always only read it as an extension of "Thy will be done" and nothing else. On the one hand, this clause acknowledges the contrast between that which is spiritual and that which is worldly, but on the other, it also works as a thanksgiving, to the degree that God's name is hallowed, His kingdom has come, and His will is done in this world. More broadly, it acknowledges the perfection of Heaven and the lack of perfection in the material world and expresses longing for the material world becoming more like the perfect spiritual world.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org96db11b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org96db11b">Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org96db11b">
<p>
Here we at last come to the asking for day-to-day, bodily things. One of the points the Council of Trent makes is exactly that the asking for bodily things comes only after asking for the highest and most spiritual things. I also appreciate the amount of meaning they find in the few words in this line. Asking for "our" daily bread acknowledges that you have to work, but you also rely on God's help for anything good that comes into your life. Asking for "daily" bread acknowledges that you're asking for what you need everyday - necessities, not luxuries. "This day" acknowledges that what you had yesterday might not come automatically today - you can't take these things for granted and should keep on being thankful so long as you have what you need. Lastly, "Give us" rather than "give me" encourages the one praying to think not only of himself, but of the needs of all of his fellow men.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not Christian, this is an impressive amount of religious meaning to pack into one line! I think it's maybe significant that we're really getting to the richest lines of the prayer when we turn from asking for high-level spiritual goods to normal, earthly needs.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcec1cec" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcec1cec">Forgive Us Our Trespasses as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcec1cec">
<p>
This might be considered the heart of the Christian belief system, and might be the part of the prayer least easily adapted to other beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I think that forgiveness is an important part of many religious beliefs, but in Christianity, it is <i>the</i> belief, and so the line in the most common Christian prayer that most directly deals with forgiveness deserves a bit of attention. Once again, the plural subject ("forgive <b>us our</b> trespasses as <b>we</b> forgive those who trespass against <b>us</b>") does a lot of heavy lifting - this is not only asking for help with one's own forgiveness, but for all of mankind to get better at this very hard skill. Like other parts of the prayer, this one acknowledges the work done by both the one praying and God, in partnership. Lastly, one thought I found especially helpful from the Catechism was that folks might avoid saying the whole prayer, or at least this bit, if they had folks they couldn't yet forgive. In other words, if someone had someone against whom they were still nursing a grudge, they might hold off saying the "Our Father", or at least the line about forgiving trespasses. The Council of Trent very strongly came down on the belief that this was a mistake. More broadly, I think the idea that we ought to pray for the things we <i>wish</i> were true about us, even if we currently fall short, is a useful one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org867c2ed" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org867c2ed">And Lead Us Not Into Temptation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org867c2ed">
<p>
This is another bit where the Council of Trent makes some rather Christian assumptions - that "temptation" is something the Devil does and that is an unquestionable feature of existence. That being said, I think anyone who has been alive past childhood has experienced the draw of thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors that some part of them more readily dismisses. What I thought was most helpful in the Council of Trent's analysis was the notion that temptation is an intrinsic part of being alive, and so no amount of prayer will get you to a life "without temptation" - instead, the goal is no more temptation than you can handle with God's help. This seems both a) much  more do-able, and b) more consistent with other theological interpretations. For example, Christian theology might have it that making love to a bunch of strangers is lustful and therefore bad. On the other hand, if you belong to a belief that has looser beliefs about sex, you might still believe that having sex with strangers might be bad if a) you've pledged yourself to someone else, or b) it gets in the way of forming a more serious relationship with one person. In this case, the "temptation" to have sex with multiple new folks might still be very strong, but the Christian and non-Christian beliefs about why it should be avoided would be different, even if they came up with the same recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I appreciate the reminder that this part of the prayer is useful both for dealing with "avoiding temptation" in the abstract, or in general, and also in the moment to resist specific temptations. Whatever negative stuff you want to avoid, you should likely pray for daily, as well as whenever you find yourself needing help in the moment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf1fad0b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf1fad0b">But Deliver Us From Evil</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf1fad0b">
<p>
Much as "Thy Kingdom Come" holds all of the good you might ask for in any prayer, so "deliver us from evil" holds the wish to have everything not good taken away. In some sense, everything asked for above is held within this - as all of the good things asked for are, in fact, the lack of evil. One nice thing about this bit of the prayer is that folks tend to pray to get rid of what's wrong anyway, even if not especially religious ("no atheists in foxholes" and so forth). All that being said, this bit of the prayer is at the end, because asking for spiritual goods is more important overall. Also, some seeming "evils" might actually be good for our souls. Lastly, this says "from <b>Evil</b>", rather than "from <b>evils</b>", as Christianity sees all evil as coming from one source (the devil), and acknowledges that some material circumstances might seem evil, while actually being good for you - this way of praying allows for experiencing things that seem crappy in the moment, but might be for the best in the long run.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8fe5afd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8fe5afd">Amen</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8fe5afd">
<p>
The prayer ends with a word rich with weight from scripture. Most importantly, "amen" works as a "seal" to mark the prayer as done, but with a feeling of gladness. In Catholic ceremonies, the congregation does not say "amen", but instead the priest says "amen" back to them, which they treat as a sign that the prayer has been heard and will be acted upon. According to the Council, even when praying alone, "amen" can work as a glad celebration of coming closer to God, a reminder of what the prayer just finished was truly for.

Now, one thing I kept running into while reading the Council's analysis was that their arguments were cogent, coherent, and self-consistent - <i>if you accept Christian theology</i>. If your beliefs differ, it's a bit less helpful. Even so, I think that identifying the main strands of theological belief will be helpful in coming up with what others might get out of an analysis of the "Our Father".
</p>

<p>
First off, the prayer is assumed to be directed to the single source of all goodness, God. If you are coming from a non-monotheistic standpoint, you might see the value in having a single source of all goodness, but you might not attribute it to a single "God". Regardless of what this source of all goodness is, the prayer opens by addressing it joyfully, follows up by wishing for it to be realized in the world as much as possible, and then acknowledges that all day-to-day material goods also come from this source of all goodness, and closes by acknowledging that we all fall short of what we would like, and asking for help in doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, since this is, in fact, a Christian prayer, we have to deal with concept of original sin. Original sin is implicit in much of the prayer, and explored in more depth by the Council's analysis. The entire prayer basically assumes that the one praying is in a fallen state and needs redemption, and that this prayer is one of the chief tools in seeking and achieving that end. Obviously this comes out most clearly in the lines about forgiving trespasses, leading not into temptation, and delivering from evil. As I'll get into below, this strikes me as likely one of the biggest theological differences another faith would have to work around if looking for inspiration from this prayer. Related to this is the single source of all Evil mentioned above, which has a certain tidiness to it, but again, doesn't jive with everyone's view of the world.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, much of the prayer expects those praying to do their share of the work, which I find quite interesting, and likely useful to apply outside of a Christian context. Though God is acknowledged as all powerful and the author of all good things, at least according to the Council of Trent, the one praying still has to do work and pray and believe and otherwise live consistently with what's being asked for, rather than just sitting back and waiting for God to handle everything. That might be the element of the Council's analysis that I found most interesting - it consistently stressed the active, engaged role folks need to take to get the most of prayer specifically and their spiritual life more broadly.

<h3 id="org78f6898">What Can We Learn for Other Faiths?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78f6898">
<p>
Despite the challenges of generalizing from a strongly Christian starting point, I think that there are some helpful lessons for crafting prayers for other faiths. Structurally speaking, I rather like the progression of the "Our Father" - as mentioned above, it begins by naming to Whom the prayer is addressed, asks for/affirms faith in the highest good things that Being can give, goes into more earthly requests, and closes with another universal, but this time "flipped" (deliver us from Evil rather than grant us the Kingdom of Heaven). So, I think that following the structure for prayers in other faiths would not present too much of a challenge, and could even be followed pretty closely, if wanted, by substituting in things appropriate to the Being prayed to. My <a href="#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of Fallhall's Prayer</a> is pretty close to that.
</p>

<p>
What gives a bit more of a challenge is looking at the prayer's theology and thinking through how to craft a prayer that fulfills a <i>functional</i> role similar to what the "Our Father" does for Christianity, even if it's actual structure is different - ideally, one that also functions as a "single, sufficient prayer" for a different system of belief. Drawing on the theological threads we stepped through above, the three core things we identified the prayer doing functionally are 1) acknowledging/celebrating the source of all Goodness, 2) seeking redemption as a sinful being in a fallen world, and 3) calling upon the one praying to show his faith and belief by living a life consistent with what is asked for in the prayer. 
</p>

<p>
These are highly specific to the Christian faith, and if we want to write a prayer for another faith, we'll have to express some different things. So, I've taken the three threads above and generalized them further: 1) is either the highest good, its source, or both, 2) is whatever this faith most seeks, what "problem it solves", and 3) is an affirmation to live consistent with your beliefs. For example, for Druidry, 1) might be the concept Awen, 2) might be knowledge, power, and peace, and 3) might be asking to live in harmony with nature. This might be harder for religions that don't have something as clear cut that they seek as Christianity is about seeking forgiveness for sins, or a more multi-faceted concept about what the highest good is or where it comes from.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I haven't worked out a prayer for my own beliefs following these recommendations yet, but I am glad I went through this exercise, I think it's been a helpful step, and I look forward to coming up with something.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_hail_idun_prayer">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-14
</p>

<p>
Keeping on with taking Christian prayers and writing a Heathen prayer as close to their shapes as I can, I've taken the "Hail Mary" and written the "Hail Idun". Idun is very important to me and my spiritual practice, and I think it likely that once I get to my goal of a full "Heathen Rosary", some kind of "Hail Idun" (whether this, or in Germanic metre or something else) will likely be the heart of the practice.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org75b12fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org75b12fd">Hail Idun</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75b12fd">
<blockquote>
<p>
Hail Idun<br />
Full of love<br />
Brego* is with Thee.<br />
Beloved art Thou amongst the Wen**<br />
And blessed is the fruit of Thy tree, Life.<br />
Holy Idun, Lady of Birch,<br />
Awaken our hearts<br />
To the wider world of our souls.<br />

<p>
<i>*Brego is possibly an Old English form of Bragi, God of Poetry and Idun's husband, who may or may not be a hypostasis of Odin/Woden. I picked it because it sounded better than "Bragi" to me.
**Wen is one take on the plural of *Wan, the hypothetical Old English form of the Old Norse Vanr, Vanir. Others suggest "Wanes", though there's no direct textual evidence for the word either way in Old English, and some folks question whether the Anglo-Saxons believed in the same two tribes of Gods as the Old Norse did.</i>

<p>
After asking for some resources on prayer on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/190418.html?thread=32258258#cmt32258258">past Magic Monday</a>, samchevre pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_catechism_of_the_Council_of_Trent/Part_4">The Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>. Sure enough, despite its explicit Catholic Christian focus, I found a lot of good thinking on prayer as a practice, and I'd like to share what I thought were the most helpful takeaways for folks of any faith.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc38af56" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc38af56">1. Kinds of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc38af56">
<p>
<b>Asking for Things</b>: Maybe the most common kind of prayer, the Council of Trent held that it was right and proper to ask God in prayer for anything it was right for folks to have. While it is certainly possible to ask for the wrong kind of things in prayer, and it takes some practice to ask for the right kind of things (more on both below), the evidence we have from just about every spiritual tradition that has recorded prayers shows folks asking the Gods for things that they want. If done right, this is not just a "gimme, gimme!" or a business transaction, but instead a way of acknowledging that you can't do <i>anything</i> in the world without your wider context and the help of the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thanksgiving</b>: Even if you are uncomfortable with asking for things in prayer, I think it's hard, if not impossible, to find anything wrong with prayers of thanksgiving. Even materialists <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-happiness-research/">acknowledge how worthwhile being consciously thankful is</a>. Even more so than asking for things in prayer, giving thanks for what you have in this life is a good way to acknowledge that you are dependent on wider and higher things.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf430ee4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf430ee4">2. Outcomes of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf430ee4">
<p>
<b>Bringing You Closer to the Holy</b>: I think the biggest thing prayer does for you is to bring you closer to the Holy and open you up to its influence. However you pray, it's a way to take some time to think about and reach out to whatever you think of as Holy, and hopefully to listen for some kind of answer. Many spiritual practices can do this, but prayer has the strengths of being ready to do whenever and wherever you are, and being changeable to whatever your needs are right now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acknowledging Something Greater than Yourself</b>: I talked about this in both kinds of prayer above, but most any kind of prayer leads you to acknowledge that you need the wider world and its God(s). Even for things you did "by yourself", you still have your parents, teachers, employers, and culture to thank, to say nothing of any Gods or Goddesses. While humility can go too far into abasing yourself or groveling, most of us can use a timely reminder that we are not an island and that the world has given us a great many gifts that we ought to be thankful for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Giving a Gift</b>: Prayer can also be a gift to the Gods, the same as incense or a candle or mead. The more care and thought you put into the prayer, and the better it is said, the better it works as such. This is the most helpful when you lack the means to give something else, but is still worthwhile even if you have all of the offerings you might wish for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Helping the Dead</b>: Most faiths believe that the dead can use some help in the afterlife, and that prayer is one way of offering that help. For Christians, you pray for souls in Purgatory, other faiths might pray for souls to learn the lessons of their past life as smoothly as they might so they can move on to another life, and so forth. Whatever you believe about the afterlife (well, I guess, unless you don't believe in one), it seems that prayer is helpful to those in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1cf2fd6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1cf2fd6">3. How to Pray</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cf2fd6">
<p>
<b>Prayer Works Best as a Habit</b>: The Catechism talks about prayer as a "duty", not something nice-to-have or optional. I don't know if that way of thinking is true for all faiths, but I think it is very much true that prayer works best as a habit, something you do at least every day. Much of the good of prayer only seems to come when you have done it for awhile with unalike things going on in your life. From what I have seen, it seems best to find many little ways to bring prayer into your life - something to say when you wake up, when you go to sleep, before you eat, when you put on a worn holy symbol, and so forth, as well as a "main" prayer set aside as its own thing. Of course, all of this doesn't have to be piled on at once, as that's not how good habit-building works, but over time, adding such things helps to make prayer a given, rather than something that takes will and forethought.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pray in the Right Frame of Mind with the Right Feeling</b>: For Christians, the Council of Trent recommends that Christians go into prayer with 1) utmost humilty, 2) sorrow or regret for sins done, 3) a lack of unworthy feelings like wrath or pride, and 4) faith in God. Once praying, the prayer should be heartfelt, with the ideal being that you "pour out" what is in your heart and soul with great warmth. I feel like the strong weight put on humility and sinfulness may not fit with every other faith, but the heart of the thought, that you should put yourself in a frame of mind in keeping with what is best to your Gods and then pray earnestly and with true feeling, seems like a good one to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ask for the Right Things</b>: The Catechism gave what struck me as a remarkably good rede about asking for things in prayer. First, get in the habit of asking God(s) for all things that you want in your life. Second, practice only asking for things that bring you closer to God(s). This is a really good way to build habits - you start by harnessing your natural yearning to have stuff to get you to pray often. Hopefully, as you do this, you start thinking about and acknowledging the role of the Holy in bringing good things into your life. Having gotten used to thinking about God(s) shaping what comes into your life, you can more readily think about what kinds of things God(s) might most want you to do in the world, and you can start asking for that. Through this change, you learn to ask for the right things, which makes even your prayers asking for stuff into a way to come closer to the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Prayer Becoming a Way to Do Unworthy Things</b>: For all the good that prayer can and does do, it can also become hollow, or even worse, truly harmful. If you only say the words or go through the motions, not only won't you get much out of prayer, you might sour on it or even on the Holy. There's some place for "fake it till you make it" in any kind of habit building, but if prayer feels hollow for a long time, it's likely not doing you any good, and you might need to work out a new way of doing things. Still worse is if you let prayer become a tool for your pride - showing off, making a big fuss about how strong your belief is, or the like. The Council refers to Jesus's well-known rede to pray indoors, out of the public eye. I think there's a role for public prayer, but a good rule of thumb seems to be that if you <i>only</i> pray when others are watching, you're likely doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Lone Sufficient Prayer Can Be Helpful to Have</b>: The Catechism puts forth the "Our Father" as a wholly sufficient prayer by itself. In other words, as a Christian, if you only pray the Our Father, you're doing everything you need to do with prayer. Other prayers are helpful and do a lot of good, of course, but they say that you only really <i>need</i> this one prayer. I found this a highly interesting thought. I think it would be very helpful to look at your faith and ask yourself "if I could only say one prayer for the rest of this life, and I wanted to get at everything that is most important in my faith, what would that prayer be?" I think that most faiths likely don't have a ready-to-go answer the way Christianity does (perhaps the "Bond Among Druids" for Revival Druidry), but that writing it would be a worthy goal to strive for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some Hands-On Tips</b>: The Council also gave a handful of more hands-on tips that I thought were helpful: 1) "Mental Prayer" (praying without speaking out loud) not only works, but is often best suited to sharing strong, deep feelings. That being said, praying out loud helps you stay focused and can be a spur to feelings of devotion. 2) Food and drink can make it harder to have the right mindset or feeling for prayer, so it might be best to pray without having eaten or had drinks besides water for some time. Fasting can also bring on an even stronger feeling for prayer. 3) Try to make your deeds outside of prayer line up with what you ask for in prayer. If you ask for help, but give no help to others, you shouldn't think that will work out well for you.
</p>

<p>
This started out as at least half a joke, but as I worked through it, I was like "huh, maybe this isn't all bad". The Lord's Prayer is one of the few pieces of my lukewarm Christian upbringing that really stuck in my mind, and I've always appreciated its cadence, so I tried to keep that as much as possible here while making the concepts fitting for a prayer to Woden. That being said, I'm <i>really</i> new at this prayer/poetry thing, so I'm sure I'll look back at this in a bit and cringe.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Allfather, who art in Fallhall,<br />
Awesome be Thy name.<br />
Thy walkyries come, Thy will be done,<br />
On fields choosing the winners.<br />
Teach us this day our daily lore,<br />
And welcome us as wayfarers,<br />
As we welcome those who wayfare amongst us.<br />
Lead us not into shamefulness,<br />
And unshackle us from fetters.<br />
For Thine is the wisdom,<br />
and the greatness, and the lordship,<br />
As long as this age shall last.<br />
Alu.<br />

<p>
Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.
</p>

<p>
It is the thrown-out plastic water bottle in an otherwise spotless stream. It is the streaming comedy that rings brittle and hollow. It is the buzzing of a notification for a social media app. It is the sneering look of cynical contempt that curdles a young face.
</p>

<p>
Call it ennui. Call it anomie. Call it nihilism. Call it by whichever French philosophical word you like. It is an <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">Immoral Maze</a>. It is <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk</a>. It is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.
</p>

<p>
So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-destinations_and_journeys">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-22
</p>

<p>
The other day, I read <a href="https://open-space.dreamwidth.org/8001.html">this post</a> the other day by an online acquaintance, which reinforced the old-but-good maxim that it is not the destination that matters, but rather the journey. I agree with this, but in responding to the post, I had a few thoughts on it that I thought I'd get down and post here.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2cd3914" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cd3914">The Destination is not the <i>Goal</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cd3914">
<p>
So, you've likely heard some variation of this fortune-cookie-style wisdom before, that the journey is what matters, not where you're going. As I said above, I think this is mostly true and worth keeping in mind, since our psychology and society often push us into laser-focusing on the destination with remarkable tunnel vision. It's helpful to be reminded that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo">"life moves pretty fast - if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."</a> Also, every single successful person you ever talk to will tell you that the experience of achieving what they were after was nowhere near as engaging and interesting as the pursuit. Also, paradoxically, if you start out overly focused on outcomes and end points, you might just miss out on developing what you need to develop to even reach them at all. Often, focusing on the process instead of the goal is <i>how</i> you get to the goal at all. But notice in all of these examples, we're still talking about goals and destinations, they're still assumed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org862b6aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org862b6aa">Destinations are <i>Excuses</i> for Journeys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org862b6aa">
<p>
Okay, so journeys = good and destinations = bad, right? We should just stop setting goals or having specific places to go, right? Well, maybe not so much. There's a difference between a journey and wandering - the destination. So, we have a bit of a paradox. We want to value destinations less than journeys, but we need destinations to have journeys. What I realized in responding to my friend's post is that destinations are <i>excuses</i> for journeys - necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for what we're looking for. I keep having this insight over and over again playing with my daughter - I'll get frustrated that she's being slow to take her turn on Candy Land, or that she gets distracted by a stick while kicking her soccer ball into a goal. On my better days, though, I'll catch myself and realize "oh, right, achieving the 'goal' of this activity isn't actually why we're doing this, it's so that she can have fun and spend time with me and learn things". Another helpful example for me is playing games. Within the game itself, sure, you're playing to win, but you're <i>really</i> playing the game to have fun with your friends, so you likely shouldn't act like a dick to try to win. So how do we recognize that we need destinations so that we'll take journeys, while not attaching too much importance to them?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga49e706" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga49e706">How Do you Balance these?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga49e706">
<p>
I like to think about it as something similar to the advice to have "strong opinions, loosely held" that you'll run into in the startup world. It's helpful to have specific goals or destinations, maybe even ambitious ones, but not to focus on them so hard that you lose sight of what's around you on the way. One thing I think helps do this is to be suspicious of "efficiency", when that means "get to the outcome as fast as possible". Sure, sometimes efficiency is worthwhile, but only when it is compatible with whatever other goals or values the journey might be meant to support. If you purposely chose to take the scenic route for the sights and stops, it's foolish to speed once you get on it. If you asked your kid to help clean up so she learns to be helpful and responsible, then it's dumb to do things for her because she's slow about it. If you started a company to have freedom and autonomy, it's foolish to take a deal that puts you in someone else's pocket. So, to properly value the journey, we have to think about not where we're going, but why we chose that end point in the first place, and be ready to adjust along the way.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reading_goal_for_2022">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-05
</p>

<p>
This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:
</p>

<p>
<i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i>
</p>

<p>
I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?
</p>

<p>
A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="https://fs.blog/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/#2-the-lindy-effect">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.
</p>

<p>
So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

For now, I'm lucky enough to get to share my thoughts with students every semester. That being said, there's a lot of stuff that I think is really helpful that I can't justify sharing in my course, as it's not so much about "business" or "communication". So, I reckoned I'd gather up that kind of thing here. Mostly, it's stuff I wish I had known when I was younger, so it ought to be very helpful to young folks. On the other hand, I wasn't all that young when I learned a lot of this, so you might still find something helpful here even if you're not so young.

Given that this is the internet, and that I teach at a university, I feel like I have to say clearly that these are my own views, and not those of my employer. I've posted them here to help maintain some of that distance. If you see anything here that upsets you, I'd like to hear from you so we can talk it over, especially if you're one of my students.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6df6d3d">
<p>
My good friend Jonathan introduced me to "mental models", which are perhaps best explained by the blog <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a>, but here's the short version: different fields have their own ways of thinking about the world, and many of these ways can be applied outside of their home field. Naming these ways of thinking as more-or-less contained "models" makes it easier to remember and apply them in a variety of situations. The other reason it's helpful to think of them as separate "models" is that it reminds you that they are just that: useful abstractions that help you understand the world, not the raw, objective truth.

<h4 id="org7734135">Learn How to Read a Book</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7734135">
<p>
Anyone who wants to read books for more than fun needs to read <i>How to Read a Book</i> by Adler and Van Doren. If you haven't read it, your education has a serious gap. They break down reading into four levels: 1) Elementary, 2) Inspectional, 3) Analytical, 4) Syntopic. 1) <i>Elementary reading</i> is what you learned in grade school: marks on a page form meaningful words - that's all most folks know how to do. 2) <i>Inspectional reading</i> could be called "intelligent skimming" - you shoot to get the most out of a book in a fixed amount of time. 3) <i>Analytical reading</i> is where things get interesting. This is when you want to get the most out of a book, <i>period</i>. You take all the time you need to grok it in fullness. 4) <i>Syntopic reading</i> is when you want to understand a concept or field of study and so you read a lot of works by different authors and make sense of them all together. Even if you don't follow the exact scheme of this book or the techniques it outlines, I think it is very useful to have an idea of different levels of reading depending on what you're trying to do, and to apply them intentionally.

<h4 id="org24f31f5">Use Divergence and Convergence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org24f31f5">
<p>
I was introduced to this pair of concepts by my former boss Tony, who learned them by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Basadur">Dr. Min Basadur</a> and becoming certified in his creative problem solving approach (which is currently called <a href="https://www.basadur.com/simplexity/">"Simplexity"</a>). In creative thinking, you have two processes which are both necessary, but are better done separately: "diverging" and "converging". <i>Diverging</i> is where you try to generate as many options as possible. <i>Convergence</i> is when you evaluate the options generated and try to pick the best ones based on whatever criteria is relevant. These two ways of thinking use very different mental processes, and they interfere with each other. This approach applies in a surprisingly broad number of fields: in writing, you want to write a crappy first draft and edit, if you're figuring out where to go to dinner with your friends, throw out any options you can think of without worrying about if any of them are 'good', and only <i>then</i> pick something from that list. So, any time you're trying to solve a problem, first come up with as many options as you can, pause, and then look at those options and ask which ones work. Repeat as needed.

<h4 id="org4374b81">Seek Out Old, Weird Things</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4374b81">
<p>
Don't waste your time trying to fit in. Not because fitting in isn't important - it is. But that shit will take care of itself. Even the weirdest, most against-the-grain bastard you can think of is still a product of his time and culture. So, unless you are already a hermit living deep in the woods, cultivate an interest in the obscure, the far off, and the long ago. Even though there are certain charms to eccentricity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYpsdBJlBcU">in and of itself</a>, that's not what I'm pushing here. In a big, highly-linked world, your best hope for being valuable is to bring a combination of talents and knowledge to the table that <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/navals-writing">no one else has</a>, not by doing what everyone around you is doing. The two best heuristics I know of for making this happen are to go after what is weird and what is old. When you start poking around weird/old things, you're going to run into a lot of mularkey, but this is actually a feature, not a bug - you get to practice evaluating sources and how they fit in with what else you know. If everything you encounter fits into a neat, coherent system without this work, you are missing or distorting large chunks of reality, because reality is messy. What do I mean by "weird"? Anything that would get a snooty look at a cocktail party is a good start - cryptids, UFOs, alternate versions of history, magic, conspiracies, and so forth. Am I saying you should <i>believe</i> all of this stuff? Of course not. The idea is to expose yourself to ways of thinking that are very different from what you'll usually encounter - sometimes, when used carefully, some of those ways of thinking are useful. And that leaves "old", this one is simpler - if it was written before you were born, chances are pretty good that it contains some ways of looking at the world that seem pretty alien to you, which again, is the point of the exercise.

<h4 id="org9017f75">Learn and Recognize the Three Economies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9017f75">
<p>
I encountered this model in John Michael Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition/9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</a>, which itself draws heavily on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E.F. Schumacher</a>. The book was helpful for a variety of reasons, but the best bit was a mental model (see above). Greer breaks down "the economy" into three separate economies that work very differently: the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Economies. I'll start in the middle with the most familiar: the <i>Secondary Economy</i> is the economy of goods and services. I cut up meat to sell to the baker and use the proceeds to buy the products of the candlestick maker. Economics as a field is very good at analyzing the Secondary Economy, but tends not to think much about the <i>Primary Economy</i>, which is everything the natural world does to allow human economic activity to happen at all. When a farmer buys seed and a tractor and works his tuchus off cultivating and harvesting his crops, that's all Secondary Economy work. The fact that plants evolved little starch pods called grain, that the microbes in the soil allow plants to grow in it, that bees pollinate the plants, and that the sun shines down free energy for photosynthesis is all the Primary Economy. Lastly, we have the <i>Tertiary Economy</i>, which is the economy of financial instruments like money, loans, and stocks. Theoretically, everything in the Tertiary Economy is a representation of something in the Primary or Secondary Economy: I have a piece of paper called a "Title" that says I own a chunk of land, but the bank has a piece of paper saying they get the land if I don't pay back the loan they gave me to buy the title, and so on. So long as the Tertiary Economy remains pretty lightly linked with the Primary and Secondary economies, it's incredibly useful - using money to settle transactions and measure wealth has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">lots of benefits</a>, and other financial instruments help to start bigger, more complex businesses that can be valuable to everybody. Unfortunately, the Tertiary Economy has a tendency to become unmoored from underlying economic reality and to eat up more and more of the total share of economic activity in the form of speculative bubbles. The more emphasis on the Tertiary Economy, the more bubbles like this happen. Our current economy is something like 75% in the Tertiary by notional dollar value, which is definitely something to think about.

<h4 id="org8c690b1">Work Out Your Relationship to Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c690b1">
<p>
This is the bit of this post I had the hardest time writing. It's big, weighty, and feelings run very strong around it. So I'll just try to dive in. At one time or another, all of us grapple with questions like "what's the point of all this?" or "how do I know what to really care about?" Some of us find answers that work for us in the teachings of a religion or a philosophy. Others of us look to what science and reason can tell us. And some of us try to bring our eyes down to the here and now and focus on what's right in front of us and set aside such big, maybe unanswerable questions. Perhaps the most common response is to distract ourselves from the questions so that we don't have to think about them. Television, booze, sex, jobs, gadgets, jewelry - whatever our own vice might be, we find something that lets us ignore those questions for a while. This is a bad long-term strategy, for at some point, <i>something</i> will happen that will show you the distractions for what they are - empty, meaningless, a waste of your precious time and attention. Sometimes this can hit like a ton of bricks: maybe someone you love dies, or maybe the relationship you've built your life around ends, or you find out you've only got a few months to live. If you wait for these heavy moments to think seriously about meaning, you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">gonna have a bad time</a>. Instead, start now. I won't tell you what traditions to explore, and I certainly won't tell you what conclusions to come to. This kind of thing is irreducibly personal, and what works for me is unlikely to work for you. If you're at a loss on where to start, there's an online book called <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> that I think does a pretty good job of outlining many of the reasons this is a thorny problem, approaches that have historically been tried and some of the problems with them, and so forth. You could also do worse than to read some ancient philosophy. If there's a religious tradition that's familiar or appeals to you, you might see what it has to offer. Wherever you start, don't expect this to be a quick project, something you sort out over the summer and never think about again. Wrestling with meaning is a life-long challenge, but one that can make everything else far more worthwhile.

<h4 id="orgf5a53c3">Meditate Discursively</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf5a53c3">
<p>
Lots of folks these days take seriously the idea of taking a bit of time every day to get your mind right, which is great. On the other hand, almost all of them practice forms of "mind-emptying" techniques that seek to still conscious thought, which is a bit less great. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with such techniques in and of themselves, but they have some little talked-about downsides. First off, very many folks find them tough to get started with or keep up. Secondly, even for folks who make a habit of it, many don't get that much out of them. Thirdly, and most seriously, a small number of people have very strong negative psychological reactions (most often if they jump straight into something like a week-long silent retreat with no prior training). Luckily, there's another method of meditation called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/68294.html">"Discursive Meditation"</a>, which I learned from John Michael Greer. This method has a long history, tremendous benefits, and pretty much perfect safety.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to do it: sit up straight in a chair, breathe deeply, and spend several minutes thinking about a specific theme of spiritual/philosophical significance. That's it! If you'd like more detail, check out the link above for a series of posts that lay it out step by step. You get all the good of training your attention not to wander, breathing deeply, and paying attention to your posture, while also giving your thinking mind a good workout as well. I've tried a wide variety of <a href="https://courses.liveanddare.com/limitless-life-meditation">meditation techniques</a>, and this one has been by far the most rewarding for me. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but think over giving it a shot. It's easy, safe, and works equally well whatever your spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) may be.

<h4 id="org183b21b">Express Romantic Interest First, Friendliness Later</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org183b21b">
<p>
Given the expectations and norms of our current culture, this one might be most useful for heterosexual males, but I hope it's helpful to whoever might need it. Many young folks, when they find themselves romantically interested in someone take an approach of "let's get to be friends, and then I'll ask her/him out later". This sounds reasonable, but is actually a terrible plan born of cowardice. Yes, I know, harsh, but that harshness comes from my own bitter experience of trying to follow this plan back in the day. Basically, asking someone out is scary, and we scramble to  mitigate that fear any way we can. It seems like asking someone out will be less scary if we know the other person already likes us as a friend. Plausible, but crap. Being friends is not the same as being lovers, they're different relationships with different dynamics and different needs. Of course, there is <i>some</i> overlap, but it's actually easier to go from "we went on a date and there wasn't any chemistry" to "so let's just be friends" than it is to go from "we feel comfortable together as friends" to "so do you want to risk ruining that with awkwardness by going on a date?" So, if there's someone you think you might want to date, ask them out instead of trying to be friends first.

<h4 id="orgdac664b">Have Kids If You Want Them</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdac664b">
<p>
So yes, kids aren't for everyone, and you definitely shouldn't have a kid if you aren't ready or don't really want one, but overall, kids are pretty great. I wanted to state this explicitly, because from the outside, it's easy to see what sucks about having kids: they take your time, they're expensive, they throw fits, they cover you in snot and get you sick, and so on. The thing is, from the outside, it's also harder to see what is great about having kids: watching a human gradually come online, seeing your own facial expressions mirrored back to you, having someone who feels emotions more intensely than you even know how to run up, throw their arms around you, and bury their face in your shoulder. There is absolutely nothing like it.

<h4 id="org7462fe6">Learn from the Stoics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7462fe6">
<p>
There's a lot of great stuff in ancient philosophy, but if I had to pick one thing that's most helpful, it would be the core insight of Stoicism: "you can't control what happens to you, but you <i>can</i> control how you react to it". Simple to state, hard to live. Someone cuts you off in traffic? You didn't make that happen, but you have full control over whether you get mad, how mad you get, and what you do because you're mad. Again, I know, easier said that done. And the Stoics acknowledged that you might not be able to stop that initial flare of anger from appearing, but <i>you are not your emotions</i>. They are something that happen to you, and you can choose to engage with them or distance yourself from them. Sometimes anger is useful, because it motivates you to right wrongs. Other times it just stresses you out for no reason. Learning to get inside your own cognitive processes like this is enormously helpful. Instead of being jerked around by whatever emotion happens to flare up due to circumstances, you can decide to steer your life based on whatever values you find truly important.

<h4 id="org93ede19">Turn Off Notifications, Feeds, and News</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org93ede19">
<p>
Most folks say that time is your most valuable resource, but I'd tweak that to say that <i>attention</i> is your most valuable resource. We've all had hours or days or weeks where we didn't do much and felt vaguely crappy afterwards. We've also all had experiences of intense, focused attention, maybe only for a few minutes, that have stuck with us as peak moments. Time may be the quantitative measure of your finitude in this existence, but attention is the qualitative. Where I'm going with all this high-flying philosophy is that you should be utterly ruthless in guarding your attention from anyone and anything that tries to grab it without your express, willed intent. Ever had a pleasant evening spoiled when you got an text from someone wanting you to deal with some problem for them? Ever been right in the middle of straightening out a complicated argument in your head when an email alert has popped up and you lose that almost-there insight? Ever been at dinner with a date, you're really getting into the conversation, and then they check their phone? Notifications destroy the quality of whatever they interrupt, even if you don't do anything else with them right away. It's even worse when the notifications try to further hijack your attention - taking you to a social media post that is at the top of a rabbit hole you go down for hours or to a news story that freaks you out and ruins your mood for a whole weekend. Notifications are evil. Turn as many of them off as you can possibly get away with. Put your attention where <i>you</i> want it to go, and keep it there for as long as <i>you</i> decide.

<h4 id="org3403aea">Spend Some Time Outside</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3403aea">
<p>
This one really is this simple: every day if you can, but at least once a week, go spend some time sitting or walking outdoors. If you can get somewhere with plants and animals, go there. If not, consider moving somewhere less hellish, but in the meantime, sun or moon and sky will do just fine. Most of us spend most of our lives in large boxes looking at smaller, brighter boxes, focusing on an abstract world of words, images, and thoughts. As such, we have very little connection to the actual, physical world that keeps us alive. So, go outside. This shouldn't be some doleful chore (though, on some days in the summer in Texas, it can feel that way). Go feel the warm sun on your face, watch squirrels get frisky, check out good-looking guys or gals. Fifteen or twenty minutes is great if you can get it, but even just a handful of minutes can do wonders.

<h4 id="org6d04776">Don't "Follow Your Passion"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d04776">
<p>
This is the core idea in Cal Newport's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love-9781455509126/9781455509126">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. "Follow your passion" was a rallying cry for Baby Boomers who had followed the overly-conservative career advice of parents who lived through the Great Depression, and it was useful for getting folks used to the idea that maybe you shouldn't be miserable at your job if you can help it. Unfortunately, it was going too far to suggest that everyone has some deep, inborn passion that they just need to discover and their whole life will fall into place. Sure, some folks have these life-defining passions, but most of them figure that out pretty young. You ever met someone who can't help but draw, no matter what? That guy's got a passion, he doesn't need the advice to find it. Most of us don't have that. Instead, most of us <i>become</i> passionate about whatever we get <i>good at</i>. So, Newport recommends you find some skills that are both rare and valuable and then get good at them. Rare so that you're not a dime a dozen, and valuable so that other people will actually pay for it. Some examples: crafting ships in bottles is rare, but not so valuable. Being a decent, but not great, computer programmer is fairly valuable, but not that rare. So, if you want a challenging, meaningful career, find something hard to get good at that's in demand, and then get good at that. Once you do, you'll have more control over what you do, who you work for, and what you achieve.

<h4 id="org092d865">Learn a Craft</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org092d865">
<p>
Learn how to make something with your hands - scarves, bread, motorcycle engines, whatever grabs you. If you don't know what you might like making, try a wide variety of crafts (remember Divergence and Convergence?). Pay attention to what seems interesting even when you're not good at it (for me, that's woodcarving). Then take some classes, watch some videos, find a club, or whatever works - learn the skills you need and then make the time to do it. Getting really good might take a lot of work, but you can get to "just fine" in many things with very little practice: for example, I bet you could go from "bread comes from a shelf in the store" to baking tasty loaves in 2 or 3 tries, tops. The goal here is not to become an artisan and quit your job to do glassblowing full time (though, if you can make that work, more power to you). The point is to concentrate deeply and engage with something outside of yourself in the real world. You'll find there's a big difference between imagining what it takes to turn water, flour, and yeast into dough versus feeling a sticky substance and smooshing it around until it feels right. Not only is it helpful to ground yourself like this, it is <i>hugely</i> enjoyable! If you've never "lost yourself" in something you cared about, then you are truly missing out. Of the most meaningful things in my life, almost all of them involved this kind of focused attention.

<h4 id="orgf7af6ae">Make the Right Thing Easier</h4>

I learned this from the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-house-that-cleans-itself/9780736949873">The House that Cleans Itself</a>  by Mindy Starns Clark. If you have tried something multiple times with the best of intentions, but for some reason it won't stick,  "I'll do it again, but this time I'll just try harder" is most likely a losing strategy. Instead, find a way to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, mail used to pile up on the credenza by the door. So, my wife and I put a two-drawer inbox on the credenza and a recycling bin next to it. Now, it's easy to sort what's mine or hers, and any junk mail goes right in the recycling. Apparently, it was too hard to walk the 15 feet to the main recycling bin, but it's not too hard to drop it within arm's reach. Go figure. Seriously, sometimes the tweaks that make something doable will be downright embarrassing. You can apply this concept in lots of areas of your life: set up automatic savings, don't have junk food in the house, put your alarm where you have to get out of bed to turn it off, have charging cables everywhere you might need to charge your phone, and so forth. There <i>are</i> some things where the answer is training your willpower, but more often than you might think, you can find a way to make it easier to win.

This advice has become much more widespread of late, but allow me to reiterate: you will not be good at something when you start. You get good at it by doing it. Humans are imitative animals, so if you want to be good at something, act as much like someone who is good at it as you can, and then keep at it. Eventually, the act will become the reality (likely far before you believe it). Don't put anybody at risk, of course, but it is almost always much safer to risk failing than you're afraid it is.

If you're anything like me, you might have grown up drinking too much other liquid (like Dr. Pepper) and not enough water. Luckily, the Army beat this out of me, so I now take hydration very seriously. If you don't drink much water, you will be <i>shocked</i> at how much better you feel if you get enough. Here's how to do it: buy a 1 quart bottle that you will find convenient to carry around pretty much everywhere. Set a goal of drinking 2 of these a day (more if you do something that makes you sweat much). Set specific times/events by which to empty the bottle - for example "I'll drink one by lunch time and the next one by the end of the work day". If you find yourself getting light-headed, add a <i>tiny</i> pinch of salt to one or both bottles. If you are thirsty, add a 3rd or 4th bottle. If you drink any alcohol, consider going for that 3rd or 4th bottle just in case, and make sure you get some salt either in food or added to your water. Seriously, if you haven't been getting enough water, you have no idea how much it helps: headaches, tiredness, muscle growth, weight loss - all better with water.

If you have a more intensive stretching practice, like Yoga or Gymnastic training or the like, then that's awesome, but even if you are otherwise a couch potato, do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes stretching every day.

Okay, this one is best done by demonstration, but it's important enough that I didn't want to leave it out here. As folks who spend far too much time sitting, we are all bad at standing, which paradoxically also makes us bad at sitting. We stand and sit in ways that damage our skeletons and circulatory systems, so it'd be great to fix that. If you want to go <i>real</i> deep, check out <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deskbound-1-standing-up-to-a-sitting-world/9781628600582">Deskbound: Standing Up to a Sitting World</a> by Dr. Kelly Starrett, which is where I got this checklist for proper standing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Feet</i>: Plant your feet, toes straight forward (not out to the side or pointed inward) about hip-width apart.</li>
<li><i>Knees</i>: Very slightly tense your muscles as if trying to turn your toes outward while keeping your heels planted, but don't let your toes actually move. You should feel this as a slight tension in your knees, which this movement stabilizes.</li>
<li><i>Hips</i>: Tense your butt cheeks to do a humping motion with your hips, moving your tail bone down and forward. For a less crude metaphor, imagine that your hips are a cup and that you don't want to pour any liquid out the front. This stabilizes your hips.</li>
<li><i>Lower Back</i>: Gently tense your abs, about 1/3 of full tension, pulling them back toward your spine</li>
<li><i>Upper Back</i>: Rotate your arms in your shoulder sockets. To do this, with your hands at your sides, rotate them until your thumbs face forward.</li>
<li><i>Head</i>: Move your head a bit forward and backward and feel for the spot where it's sitting right on top of the stable pillar you just made from the ground up.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations, you are now standing the way your body was designed for! Keeping your body in this position every waking hour is a bit much, but I use this process as a handy check-in to "reset" when I notice myself slouching.
</p>

<p>
To sit, just do steps 4-6, but you'll notice it's much harder. Your legs, and especially your hips, are doing a lot of the work of maintaining good posture when you stand, and when you sit, you basically don't have them to help.

<p>
The very same things are what excited me and disappointed me the most in this book. It presents intuition as a very no-nonsense ability that is critical for effective decision making, and gives advice on how to train to be better at it. Exactly what I wanted! On the other hand, it describes "intuition" as simply the ability to learn to detect patterns and apply past experiences to current situations, without consciously realizing  you've made that match - which is rather less romantic than I might hope for something as big and spooky as "intuition" to be. Once I set aside my childish disappointment, though, I found this book to be full of gems, and more importantly, to include detailed instructions on how to practice and train your team on these skills. I was expecting some help on decision making and ended up walking away with great techniques for leadership and creativity as well.

<p>
This book provides a great overview of the tradition of Western philosophy. Besides providing useful summaries of some of the major thinkers and what their philosophy can do for you in your life, it shows the the connecting threads between thinkers that might seem totally unrelated at first glance. Each chapter gives a brief thumbnail of the biography and thinking of a major philosopher, which is great, but what's really useful about this book is that every chapter addresses a specific concern that everyone faces - such as unpopularity, money, and frustration. Alain's style is warm and gentle, with a hint of detached humor that makes for enjoyable reading. If you've ever thought "I wish I knew more about philosophy", this is the place to start.

Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my "operating manuals" for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality.

<b>By Julia Cameron</b>

<p>
I have to admit that if I picked this book up sight unseen and flipped through it, I would likely have put it back on the shelf - it has a lot of markers for being a bit too "woo woo" or "touchy feely" for my usual tastes. Fortunately, it came highly recommended by a bunch of well-grounded people that I respect, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. The basic premise is that everyone can be creative, but most of us have developed the idea that we're not allowed to or have otherwise blocked our access to our creative selves. To counteract this, it provides a twelve week guided program to lead to greater creativity. I'm not very far into the program, but already I am seeing the benefit of its two core habits: <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> and <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/">Artist Dates</a>. If you are already convinced that you could be more creative with some help and don't need as much back up, consider going straight to the workbook.

<b>By Lawrence Freedman</b>
</p>

<p>
Man oh man am I loving this book. It puts out a comprehensive record of thinking about the concept of strategy in western thought from the Bible and Homer all the way to modern theorists. Along the way, Freedman provides analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various formulations and their applications. Despite what might turn into a dry, intellectual subject, the book is quite clear and readable, moving briskly through trends and eras of thought. For me, it's greatest value is highlighting the connections and influences between figures as disparate as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and John Boyd. I suspect that I will be coming back to my notes on this and its bibliography for years to come.

<b>By Tim Ferriss</b>
</p>

<p>
Besides being a phenomenal "learn to cook from nothing" cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn anything. Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn't done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it's rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in The 4 Hour Workweek and The 4 Hour Body, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other "how to learn" frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you're already a master cook, check this book out for it's advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.

I mentioned this book in my post on <a href="#storytelling_part_5-resources_for_digging_deeper">Storytelling Resources</a>, but I thought it deserved its own call out. An incredibly slim book, you can read and understand it in an evening, but will likely return to it again and again. This book clearly lays out the rules of modern American usage and style, favoring concise, vigorous prose. Even if you enjoy waxing more eloquent, this provides a great starting place from which to depart. It's also admirably organized, with a detailed table of contents and clear headings for the rules it propounds, making it ideal as a reference work (which it will be for the vast majority of its usefulness, since it will only take an hour or two to read it the first time). If you write at all for your living or for pleasure, you should have this book in easy reach at all times.

<p>
<b>By Walter Isaacson</b>
</p>

<p>
I have long irrationally avoided biographies, despite encountering a few excellent ones like Team of Rivals, so I decided I needed to remedy that to read one about a personal hero of mine. Leonardo stands as the archetypal "Renaissance Man", with achievements in art, architecture, science and more all under his belt. His brilliant and beautiful notebooks make any journaler feel inadequate. And yet, one of the most reassuring parts of this book is that it seems unlikely that Leonardo was as set apart intellectually as an Einstein or a Newton, nor as naturally artistically gifted as a Michaelangelo. Instead, Leonardo learned everything through a combination of insatiable curiosity and determined attention and focus. He was also able to turn his varied interests and propensity for abandoning projects into a firm set of multidisciplinary knowledge that spurred creative insight across fields. So he's something of a role model for those of us who worry we didn't win the genetic lottery or feel a lack of focus. This book is fantastic and humanizing while still highlighting the key takeaways from his life that we can enjoy in our own.

I’ve done my best to share a fantastic beginner’s guide to storytelling with this series, but there is a lot of depth to all of the topics that I’ve touched on. Below, I provide my recommendations on resources for digging into Story Structure, Effective Practice, Public Speaking, Oral Storytelling, Writing, and Visual Storytelling. In each section, I’ve provided a handful of my favorite “how to” resources, whether books, blogs, videos, or courses along with a section of illustrative examples applying the lessons you’ll learn from the how to books. These lists are by no means exhaustive, and if I’ve missed any of your favorite works on storytelling, please let me know, as I am always hungry for new insights on the topic.

The Story Grid by Shawn Coyne
</p>

<p>
If you want to dive deep into structure and how to put together a story that works, you could do a lot worse than to read The Story Grid. Shawn Coyne takes an editor’s approach to figuring out the nuts and bolts of what “works” in a story or not. The book focuses mostly on fiction, but he has regular blog posts and further material at the website that apply it to all sorts of other examples.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdac919e" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgdac919e">The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdac919e">
<p>
I dare you to time how long you can read about story structure without Joseph Campbell coming up. This book is where he lays out the fundamental structure shared by almost every enduring mythological tale across the world. Something about this sort of story speaks to the fundamental human experience, and has been for at least thousands of years. If you’ve ever heard of a “hero’s journey” or the “monomyth”, this book is where that comes from.

<h5 id="org7605278">Save the Cat by Blake Snyder</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7605278">
<p>
Blake Snyder devotes his book to the end-to-end process of writing a screenplay, and so contains a lot of material not directly related to structure, but it has a rock-solid basic approach to thinking about structure, and even better, hands-on details about how to actually do that. My personal favorite thing from the book is “The Board” - a board you put up on the wall that shows the breakdown into acts, on which you place index cards for each scene, and for each scene you track the change in emotional charge and what the conflict is. The Story Grid covers a lot of the same ground, but they are useful to compare and cherry pick from.

This delightful (and short) video shares both Vonnegut’s clear understanding of story structure as well as his wit. I recommend watching it a few times: the first time to enjoy it as an entertaining presentation, and then again to realize “oh wait, there’s actually something there.”

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org867fd50">
<p>
Screenwriting classes love to use Tootsie as an example, because it’s just a good, solid story with a structure that works. Every scene moves the story forward, every scene has a shift in emotional charge, every scene has conflict, and the character grows exactly the way we want to see him do so.

<p>
I am especially tickled to point to this example because it is framed as a narrator telling a story - aren’t we all so meta. Every anecdote in the seemingly scattered remembrances of the narrator actually contributes to the overall story, following that Red Rider BB gun. It’s extremely tight and on point the whole time, which helps to explain why people happily re-watch every year.

<h5 id="org161016a">Pulp Fiction</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org161016a">
<p>
Another favorite of film nerds, Pulp Fiction serves as a great example of how structure does not equal chronology. Tartantino chooses to show us scenes based on what he wants us to know about the character at the time, which means that he can’t rely on normal causality to carry the plot along if he gets the sequencing wrong. We’re left with a movie where we buy into the plight of a lot of pretty bad dudes and enjoy struggling along with them.

<h5 id="org96a0041">The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org96a0041">
<p>
Okay, this one is by the far the nerdiest thing I’m recommending, but hear me out. Each one of these novels works as a tightly structured hard boiled detective story - all the obligatory scenes and genre conventions are there in ways that are both satisfyingly familiar and intriguingly new. At the same time, each book builds the overall character arc of its titular protagonist, Harry Dresden (spoiler alert) and calls back to previous novels in both expected and unexpected ways. The quality certainly improves over the course of the series, but even the first few books are enjoyable stand alone detective stories.

I like to think I’ve done a lot of the deconstructing and sequencing work for you on Storytelling with this series, but it’s a meta-skill worth learning.

The book is helpfully organized into sections focused on getting started, building skills effectively, and maintaining motivation when it gets hard. Intended as a quick reference to be carried around and looked at again and again, this book won’t convince you that deliberate practice is the way to get great if you don’t already believe it, but it will help you immensely in actually doing the work.

We’ve talked about this book before, but it is the best “one stop shop” on how to go from zero to giving great presentations I’ve seen. It discusses, structure, practice, and delivery in ways that will be familiar to you from this series, and has a great recommended reading list at the end, with some of the same titles you’ll see here. I especially appreciate its emphasis on tying together the spoken message and whatever visuals you are presenting, and how they can reinforce each other to create a stronger whole.

There are a lot of different courses offered by Dale Carnegie Training these days, some focused more specifically on public speaking than others, but the underlying principle for all of them is to better understand and empathize with other people as human beings. I have not taken one of their courses yet, but I’ve heard nothing but good things and its on my list.

Another recommendation that I have to provide on the strength of what I’ve heard, this is the best known way to make sure you get a lot more chances to speak in public and learn by doing. They have clubs all over the world and create a supportive environment for people to build their skills as a speaker and get meaningful feedback. If you don’t have a job that requires a lot of presentations (or if you do and are hungry for even more), this is a great way to get your reps in.

That’s not all - the article linked is part of a series on giving presentations, which itself is part of a series on Communication skills.

It talks about the feedback loop created by our body language, the mental states they create, and what we believe about ourselves. Does public speaking terrify you? If so, the cure is to adopt the posture and body language of someone triumphant and powerful to counteract your natural scared body language. It sounds nuts, but it works.

It gets you used to finding relevant connections with other people and spinning them into a story, and also teaches you to read what’s working for your audience and what’s not. Plus, you’ll bomb a few times, which feels terrible, but then you keep going and you realize it’s not a big deal, which is crucial to build the confidence to tell entertaining stories with enough verve.

Even though Mahnke’s cadence includes the occasional hilariously inexplicable pause, he effectively holds your interest and builds tension to creepy climax of each episode. Unlike Hardcore History, these are usually just the right length for listening while doing chores or making a commute.

While the thrust of the book is on persuasion, as Luntz has worked as a marketer and political speechwriter, the advice to choose your words based on the impact they will have on your audience applies to anything that relies on words. I find it especially useful to compare and contrast with The Elements of Style, which is predominantly focused on aesthetics rather than persuasion.

In this brief work, Pressfield takes the lessons he’s learned writing in different fields - advertising, screenplays, fiction, non-fiction, and self help - and how he applies them across the board. The title reveals the most important lesson: people are busy and don’t want to read anything unless there’s a reason it is compellingly interesting to them - which means you need to develop some serious empathy to get anywhere as a writer. Funny how that keeps popping up about storytelling, right?

Most of my examples here of good writing are fiction, because most non-fiction writers must split their effort between getting good at writing and getting good at whatever they’re writing about, whereas fiction authors can focus almost entirely on the craft of making good prose. Steven Johnson’s early works show the signs of that division of labor - Emergence covers absolutely fascinating material and makes extremely valuable connections, but it gets a big clunky to follow at times. His more recent works, however, expertly weave together the disparate facts and insights he shares with you. Honestly, I could have picked from several books, but I like Where Good Ideas Come From the best.

Again, most folks would not point to Neal Stephenson as a prose stylist, but this book is the perfect example of nailing  the execution of a techno-political thriller. As I’ve mentioned before, Stephenson is one of my favorite authors, and I’ve read all of his books, so this one especially stood out by being different in style to his others. The long, information-rich digressions that I so love from Snow Crash and The Baroque Cycle are completely missing here, because this book is all about creating tension and then ratcheting it up relentlessly. Other than Breaking Bad, I have never seen such an expert display of continually increasing stakes: imagine an infinite sequence of falling out of frying pans into fires into frying pans and so on.

For those of you not familiar with comics, Will Eisner is the guy after whom their biggest award is named - he started writing comics in New York in the 30’s when his high school buddy Bob Kane (creator of Batman) suggested he give it a go, coined the term “graphic novel”, and worked hard to argue and prove that comics could tell  serious stories and were a legitimate literary form. This book takes what he learned from his decades of experience creating and teaching sequential art and distills it into a guide to make sure the visuals are always in service to the story - and not the other way around. Beautifully illustrated (duh) and cogently written, this book is useful for anyone who needs to convey messages with a combination of words and images, not just artists and flimmakers.

<p>
This is another meta-work: a comic book about comic books. Why am I harping on comics so much here? Well besides being a big nerd and enjoying them quite a lot, they provide an excellent comparison point to writing (nothing but words) and movies (moving pictures combined with spoken words) that allows examination of what is the same and what is different - and McCloud does exactly that. The central conceptual point of the work is that comic readers are active participants in the creation of the story, because they have to fill in the gaps between every frame. Writers and filmmakers can pull off that trick if they try, but with comics it is absolutely essential and pervasive. That creates a medium with a unique form of engagement worth exploring.

I’ve since watched several episodes of Samurai Jack and keep noticing the three techniques identified here. As with comics, I like analyses of animation as a way of learning about film, because the lack of human actors and overt stylization allows you to focus on form and composition and such like very purely.

It provides a lot of very concrete guidance on how and when to use visual language in business and personal settings, all without being good at art.

Originally aired as 3 minute (later expanded to 15 minute) shorts between programs on Cartoon Network, these are incredibly tight little self contained stories that nonetheless build into an overall picture of the Clone War, seamlessly linking the end of Attack of the Clones with the beginning of The Revenge of the Sith.

As the only Zack Snyder film I completely enjoy, I give full credit to Frank Miller for the original, which Snyder very directly adapted. Yes, this is the second time Thermopylae has come up in the examples here, but that is to be expected from a classicist infantryman. The graphic novel showcases Miller’s high-contrast style and impressive composition, but also uses size and placement of frames/panels to expertly pull you through the story. It is also just as much a story about storytelling as less gory titles like The Sandman - about the story Western Europe tells itself about its past, the stories a culture tells itself about its values, and the stories we tell ourselves to link our past with our present.

This movie is visually stunning. It came out in 1964 and I first saw it in 2017, and more than 50 years later, it still looks fantastic.  Not “good for its time” but “good for all movies ever made” in a way that is unfortunately rare. It treats us to not one, but four separate expertly told traditional Japanese ghost stories. It’s not an especially scary movie, but it is riveting and beautiful. I recommend it as an example of visual storytelling because for those of us who are American, it removes familiar cultural and artistic conventions and stands on the strength of its craft as a film alone.

<b>By Will Eisner</b>

<p>
Written by a giant of the sequential art field, this book covers the insights from decades of creating and teaching about the use of comics to tell stories. Eisner defends and establishes the usefulness and seriousness of the form as a literary medium, capable of addressing themes and issues that matter. The central tenet of the book is that the visuals must be shaped by the needs of the story and not the other way around - otherwise you get lured into meaningless set pieces that serve no purpose but to show off something that looks good. It covers a lot of the same ground as the other works we've discussed on Storytelling, but does so with beautiful illustrations (duh) and a very different focus than works addressed primarily to crafters of prose.

Tim Ferriss recommended this book for writers of all kinds, despite its focus on screenwriting. I came to it in order to get a variety of perspectives on storytelling (speaking, writing fiction, writing screenplays, and so forth). Despite the fact that I often watch movies and think "I could have written something better than that!", I have no particular ambition to become a screenwriter, but I have nonetheless found this little book quite helpful. It's advice to get really clear about what your story is about applies across the board, and I appreciate its brass tacks focus on the fact that for anybody to ever experience your fantastic art, you have to sell it, which means people have to want to buy it. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a quick, fun read on how to write punchy things that get people's attention.

<p>
We've talked before about War of Art and it's discussion of Resistance, the force within us that stops us from creating and achieving what we might. Well, Turning Pro is Pressfield's "how to" on overcoming that force, and it mostly comes down to doggedly showing up to do the work every day, regardless of how inspired you're feeling. While I find War of Art more inspirational overall, this work is a great companion that gives you concrete steps of what to do when you commit to following the advice in WoA.

This book has been on my list for a long time, but I only just now got around to reading it, and man was I missing out! It breaks down the mysterious art of writing a story that "works" into comprehensible and testable steps. That's what I think is most remarkable about this book: not that it tells you the components of a story that works (we've been getting that since Aristotle), but that it gives you tools to tighten up the feedback loop on your stories - you can evaluate your success or failure and make adjustments using these tools. You still have to put in the work and get inspired by the Muse, but all of the guesswork is removed. It has a really strong emphasis on writing fiction, but the lessons are applicable to any sort of storytelling.

I've been using the approach outlined in this book for years now, thanks to some fantastic mentors at work, but I only just got around to reading it. I don't know what took me so long to get to it - it was great, and it only took me a little over two hours to read even taking a lot of notes. The basic premise of the book is that you should tell the truth, you should tell it as a story, and you should present the story with pictures as much as possible. It goes into more detail on how to make all of that happen of course, but if you're only ever going to read one book on how tell a story that people will care about, read this one. The four presentation Storylines (Presentation Underlying Message Architectures, or PUMAs) are worth the price of admission alone.

<b>By Donald Sull and Kathleen Eisenhardt</b>

<p>
This book identifies six types of "simple rules" that offer enough guidance to be useful but enough flexibility to respond to complexity. More exciting than that, it walks through how to create your own simple rules for work and life. Unless you're my kind of geek, it's not the sexiest topic in the world, but for one thing, it's shockingly useful, and for another, the authors use a conversational tone that makes for pleasant reading. Whether you're looking to make better decisions about investing, dating, or your company's strategy, this book has you covered.

<b>By Steven Johnson</b>
</p>

<p>
I worry a bit that this is becoming the Steven Johnson fan club, but I am really enjoying his books recently. This one takes a look at history through the lens of what was made possible through the development of some key technologies, like glass and sanitation. Besides providing a plethora of fun trivia, like the fact that in the mid nineteenth century it was more practical to raise the entire city 10 feet than to tunnel under it to install a sewer system, or that chlorinating water reduced infant mortality by ~40%, the book provides a fascinating reframe of how we normally process history. Instead of looking at decisions made by individuals or trends embodied in governments and cultures, it asks "what couldn't have happened without this technology that did happen after it was invented?" Maybe not as immediately useful as Where Good Ideas Come From, but it's possibly a more approachable and enjoyable introduction to Johnson's style. Definitely check it out.

<b>By Carl Gustav Jung, translated by H.F.C. Hull</b>

<p>
If you're like me, you probably have a vague idea of Jung from high school English classes, and something about archetypes. Maybe you heard he was an important influence on Lucas when he made Star Wars. If you studied psychology, you may have gotten a brief discussion about how he was important psychologist for a while, but we've moved past his outdated theories. Well, I'm here to tell you that Jung is both weirder and smarter than you probably think, and that makes it worth reading his stuff for yourself. Synchronicity is a perfect introduction because it is short and enjoyably mind-bending. Jung basically argues that disparate events can be meaningfully linked in ways besides causality. If nothing else, it is an enjoyable mental exercise to wrestle with such an alien concept, and who knows, you might gain a richer understanding of your own experience of the world.

I just couldn't resist a book about where the voice in your head comes from when today's post is about imagining other people's voices. I have no idea at how well regarded this book is currently as a credible explanation of where consciousness came from, but it makes a fantastic tool for imagining <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4893">what if the world really were that way? What would it mean?</a> The book argues that "consciousness" - an almost unending voice in your head that narrates your thoughts and what's going on and is perceived as "yourself" is actually a rather recent phenomenon. Jaynes says that the Old Testament documents a culture going through the transition, and that you see similar evidence in Mesopotamian history as well. There's nothing immediately practical here, but it's enjoyably mind-blowing. Plus, season one of Westworld will make a lot more sense, so there's also that.

This one is not explicitly about creativity, but I think you'll find it more helpful in that respect than you might think at first glance. Written by a pair of Navy SEAL officers who served together in Ramadi, Iraq when it was at its worst, this book lays out deceptively simple principles for effective leadership. I say deceptive because simple does not mean easy. Following the straightforward advice is much harder than understanding it. Which brings us to creativity: this book's advice on building discipline will help you immensely in building the habits you need for quality creativity. If you want to get a taste, or if you read the book and can't get enough, check out the <a href="https://jockopodcast.com/">Jocko Podcast</a>.

Ryan Holiday has been behind a lot of what I've talked about here and a lot of the links I've shared, but I haven't called him out explicitly yet. He's a modern day exponent of an ancient philosophy, and though my interest in stoicism predates my exposure to Holiday, I have found his works useful and engaging. He's best known for <i>The Obstacle is the Way</i>, which has been hugely influential with top performers from the business world to the NFL, but I have found this book more useful personally. It is a systematic analysis of how prone we all are to excessive self regard and the ways that destroys you - whether you are aspiring, achieving, or failing. Ego also hinders true creativity because it stops you from the real work you need to push limits and discover new frontiers.

Tim Ferriss and Ramit Sethi like to joke about how much their book titles sound like infomercials, but I have to admit that this book has them beat by a mile - One Minute Workout? That's even crazier than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE">six minute abs</a>. What you find when you actually dig in, though, is a thorough discussion of the science and benefits of High Intensity Interval Training. Even better, it presents a variety of HIIT workouts you can try out for your own health. Bang-for-buck-wise, HIIT is the king of exercises. Even better, training your heart to speed up and slow down regularly has dramatic effects on your brain's ability to do the same - so following the workouts in this book will help you not only be healthier, but more creative to boot. Not a bad deal for one minute (plus another 9 of warm up, cool down, and rest - but I can't blame them for the catchy title).

I mentioned this book in the previous posts on creativity, but it didn't get its own spotlight yet. It's a classic in the realm of creativity, and a lot of what has been developed since builds on its solid foundation. It takes an extremely practical approach by recommending various exercises a teacher might assign students to encourage and develop lateral thinking, but these are just as easily self-imposed by those of us lacking adult supervision. My very favorite takeaway from this book is the idea that sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea first.

This book might be the best "bang for the buck" I've ever seen - at 42 pages, you can easily read it in an evening and almost every single page is chock full of useful, actionable tips. It lays out the steps to follow in order to generate new, creative ideas. While it lacks some of the concepts we go through in our creativity series, it easily integrates with them. Do yourself a favor and check this out.

If you spend as much time as I do listening to podcasts by Silicon Valley types, you've been hearing about this book for ages. I've been putting off reading it because I figured "well, I'm not starting a tech company, so it doesn't apply to me." Turns out that was a silly and limited way to think about the book. I ended up valuing it more for its discussion of the secrets that are the root of real economic value and its concepts of definite versus indefinite optimism. It was also the inspiration for the current series, as it talked about the importance of creativity and implementation in building the future world. It's a pretty quick read and well worth it.

<p>
<b>By Zhuang Zi, trans. Burton Watson</b>
</p>

<p>
This is an excerpt of the complete Zhuangzi, and I'm normally a rabid completionist, but there are three facts that lead me to recommend this edition: 1) This is the version I had in my physical library and therefore read, 2) The translator makes a pretty good case that what is excluded is mostly later (less awesome) additions to the work of the original author, and 3) you can get this excerpt for about one third of the price of the complete works. So, with that in mind, let me tell you what's great about this book. It's a lot more lively than most philosophy, featuring poetry, metaphor, and humor. I found it almost as valuable as a demonstration of an alternative way to convey deep, important ideas as I did for the actual ideas it was discussing. It's also interestingly different from the Daoism you may know from the <i>Daodejing</i>. I'm not going to get a Yin-Yang symbol tattooed on me anytime soon, but I have found this a worthwhile addition to my mental tool kit.

<i><p>A Note on Spelling Conventions - Skip if you are not a language nerd:</p>

<p>Since westerners started studying Chinese, they have tried to get around the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to render it. For years the most popular way was the “Wade-Giles System,” which uses various letter combinations as kludges to represent tones. It is a clever way to operate within the constraints of existing letters, but if you don’t know the code, you’re gonna say everything wrong.</p>

<p>More recently, the People’s Republic of China has introduced the pinyin system. The key feature of which is the use of diacritic marks to indicate tones, which is incredibly useful for ignorant westerners like me. With this, you can be much more straightforward in your use of letters, so even if you get the tones wrong, you’re at least getting the rest right. Because of this, I have decided to ditch the Wade-Giles spellings familiar from my youth and use pinyin without the diacritics (because they are a pain in the ass on an English keyboard).</p></i>

<p>
I decided to take advantage of my vacation in China to read some Chinese philosophy in the land that gave it birth. Looking over my bookshelf, I noticed a book I had purchased for a college class - Zhuangzi. In the class we only read a tiny excerpt, and ever since it’s been on my “meaning to read” list. So I ended up pulling it out of my bag and digging in while floating through a landscape that looks exactly like a Chinese landscape painting. 
</p>

<p>
First off, let’s provide a bit of context. “Zhuangzi” can refer to both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou">philosopher</a> (“Master Zhuang”) or to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">work ascribed to him</a> (but probably containing material added later by other people as well). Besides the semi-mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Laozi</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Daodejing</a>, Zhuangzi is the next most foundational work in Daoism. The philosopher was a rough contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a>’s in the 4th century BCE. Both of these eminent gentlemen helped to define the explosion of thinking known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought">“The Hundred Schools of Thought”</a>. In terms of influence on later philosophy, this time period is roughly analogous to the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy">Hellenisitic age</a> in the west  - a flowering of different approaches that are still discussed, debated, and even followed today. This author of Zhuangzi used this context by telling stories featuring members of other schools of thought - sometimes showing them as fellow seekers of wisdom and other times mercilessly parodying them and their hang ups. 
</p>

<p>
One of the things that struck me in the book was the similarity of the core of the philosophy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Zhuangzi essentially argues that the world is constantly changing and the only way to not be perturbed by this is align yourself with that change, which is an expression of the universal Way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Dao</a>). Despite some important differences, the core idea that we can’t control circumstances, but we can control how we react to them, will sound familiar to students of the two schools I mentioned. I will have to reread the <i>Daodejing</i>, but I don’t remember such a clear parallel there. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that such a useful and life-changing mental hack was independently discovered in multiple places. 
</p>

<p>
Which is by no means to say that <i>Zhuangzi</i> is simply a rehash of things you can find elsewhere. It is widely renowned for its imagery, poetry, and imaginative use of metaphor. Some of these struck me as simply bizarre, but many were rather beautiful. One of these poetic sections has become more famous in the west than the book that spawned it: Zhuangzi is the sage who dreamed he was a butterfly and then wondered if he were not a butterfly dreaming of being a man. Besides the imagery, the other ingredient in Zhuangzi’s secret sauce is humor, and there were several times where I would slowly smile or even chuckle as I realized something that I thought was “serious business” was actually the set up for an elaborate joke. When you put these two stylistic traits together, you get a very interesting effect: since you never know exactly where the author stands moment to moment, or even necessarily what he actually means, you have to think for yourself. You can neither buy everything he says uncritically nor dismiss him as someone you disagree with unconditionally. It’s a remarkably effective way to convey something experientially instead of didactically.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate this dynamic produced by humor, metaphor, and active engagement, let me share my favorite example. Zhuangzi frequently praises the “useless” and denigrates the “useful.” One image he uses is a <a href="http://mjglass.ca/metaphor/uselesstree.htm">gigantic tree</a> that has only been allowed to get so big because no part of it has any usefulness to humans - which would have gotten it cut down or plucked or such like. He similarly points out that useful people get put to work and sometimes even get killed doing that work, and so argues it’s good to be crippled and deformed. I was finding it hard to swallow the whole “useless is good, useful is bad” line of reasoning until one <a href="https://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu3.html#26">striking metaphor</a> got me:
</p>

<p>
"A man has to understand the useless before you can talk to him about the useful. The earth is certainly vast and broad, though a man uses no more of it than the area he puts his feet on. If, however, you were to dig away all the earth from around his feet until you reached the Yellow Springs, then would the man still be able to make use of it?”
</p>

<p>
I had a koan-like flash of insight reading this about all of the other images I had been reading. If not for that moment, I might have written the whole work off as anti-rational nonsense. For you, the “click” might come somewhere else because of a different interaction of the imagery, humor, and your own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Though I still find the <i>Daodejing</i> more relevant, Zhuangzi’s skepticism and anti-authoriatarianism was a welcome breath of fresh air in the sometimes puzzling field of Daoism, and gave me a wider understanding of the philosophy than I previously had. It also opened my mind to alternative ways to convey philosophical truths. If you have made previous forays into Chinese philosophy and found them dull or staid, perhaps you should give <i>Zhuangzi</i> a try.

<b>By Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland</b>
</p>

<p>
Neal Stephenson is probably my favorite living author, and so I buy anything with his name on it no questions asked. I tore through this on my recent flight to Beijing and rather enjoyed it. A shadowy government organization discovers that magic used to be real but doesn't work anymore, and then figures out a way to make it work again to send people back in time. A fun read that touches on all of the exciting possibilities of magic, time travel, and quantum physics. Not as many detailed asides as a pure Stephenson book, but that means that it keeps moving at a brisk pace the whole time. Give it a shot if the idea of mashing up fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction gets you all hot and bothered.

This one didn't quite make it on to my <a href="#my_operating_manuals_for_life">list of operating manuals</a>, in part because I just finished it a week or two ago and I'm not sure how much of an impact it's had on me yet. It might sound hopelessly like positive thinking hippy dippy crap, but I've been getting more and more convinced about the power of auto-suggestion, in part because of the Scott Adams <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/persuasion-reading-list-updated-1-18/">persuasion reading list</a> I've mentioned before. So I'm giving the approaches recommended in this book a good, honest try before I either dismiss it or sing its praises. If you do the same, let me know how it works out for you.

<i>Update 2022-August-25: I no longer give as central a place to many of these books as I did when I wrote this five(!) years ago. For example, I'm not a big fan of James Altucher anymore, as my further exposure to him has made him seem scammy and dishonest. So while there's nothing in the</i> Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth <i>that seems obviously bad or wrong, I don't trust it as a whole anymore. Some other books, like</i> The Poetic Edda <i>have become far more central to my life and understanding of the world. Obviously, your mileage may vary, and I wanted to keep this post as a record of where my thinking was at the time.</i>

If you accept that you have your own User Interface, you’re going to need some instructions on how to set it up and maintain it. As you know, my go to source for just about everything is books, and I have found those on the list below especially useful for hacking together my own mental operating system. They currently sit right on my desk where I can see them every day and think about what they mean to me.

</p>

<p>
This is the most practical book on this list, and I’m most confident it will be immediately useful to you.  I consider it the 80/20 solution of self-help books, the one to read if you can only read one.  Chock full of amazing tips, tricks, and strategies for improving your life in every dimension, I have adopted more ideas from here than I can keep track of. While all three of Tim Ferriss’s previous books have had a tremendous positive impact on my life, this is the capstone.

<p>
Tony Robbins’s main work on personal transformation and behavior change. I have used this book not only to shape my approach to coaching but also to upgrade my own mental Operating System across the board. I have used it to ditch bad habits, take positive action in my life, and otherwise convince myself that my life is what I make of it. If you aren’t sure what you think of Tony Robbins, check out the Netflix documentary I Am Not Your Guru to get a good taste of what he’s about.

<b>By James Altucher</b>
</p>

<p>
The most recent edition to my collection, a month or two back my friend was like “you need to read this right now,” and he was right. James Altucher argues three main points in the book: secure corporate employment for your entire life is dead and gone, it’s up to you to bring value to the world, and the best way to do that is to follow a daily practice that nourishes and improves yourself mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. He supplements all of this with a number of specific techniques on freelancing, selling, networking, and so forth. Some of the books on this list had already laid the groundwork for believing that financial success comes from no other source than me, but this book gave me the tactical kick in the butt I needed to start acting.

</p>

<p>
Equal parts manifesto and field guide, Cal Newport argues that focusing on one thing at a time and choosing important, hard work is a super power in a world of constant distraction. My own experience bears this out - when I most seriously follow the approach explained in this book, not only do I get more work done, I feel more fulfilled and happier about it to boot. This book is essential reading if you want to achieve mastery in anything or even just stand out from your peers at work.

<b>By Joshua Waitzkin</b>
</p>

<p>
One of the more challenging books on this list. I have revisited it multiple times, and every time I find a new insight I didn’t pick up before. Waitzkin has thought deeply and internalized several principles on learning and performance at the highest levels through his experience as a child chess master, world champion Tai Chi Push Hands competitor, top tier Brazilian Jiu Jitsu trainer, and a coach for the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. At times bordering on the mystical and opaque, you have to do your own share of the work with this book. Rather than concrete, actionable strategies, this book deals in fundamental principles that are relevant no matter the strategy you choose: which can be frustrating at times, but is more rewarding and useful in the long run.

Another book that doesn’t present easy, pre-digested material. We’ve talked about it somewhat extensively before. While there are a few specific how to’s scattered throughout, such as approaches to diet and exercise, it is far more useful as a foundational text on how to think about uncertainty. It’s another book where I find something new and get smarter every time I revisit it.

The only novel on this list, but don’t let that fool you - it’s still loaded to the gills with insight and useful introspective tools. This book was one of the first to seriously shake my arrogant belief that I understood myself deeply or even what “self” means. I agree with more of it every time I come back to it, and it has also been my personal bridge between stoicism and eastern philosophy - a more compatible pairing than you might think.

The shortest book here, it punches way over its weight. I first read it cover to cover on an hour long flight and it lit my mind on fire. If you have anything remotely creative inside you trying to get out, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It is uncomfortable and galvanizing at the same time - like a cold shower, you will flinch from it at first, but emerge ready to take on the world. It is medicine I take whenever I find myself getting lazy and complacent.

<p>
A quick note on translations: these last two books were obviously not written in English, and the translation you select will have a big impact on what you think of it - generally stay away from
the free Kindle editions, as these tend to be old, public domain translations of mediocre quality. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of why I chose these translations, shoot me an email and we can geek out.
</p>

<p>
My personal favorite work of stoic philosophy, it barely edged out Marcus Aurelius for my token Stoic book. Stoicism is such a central part of my personal philosophy that I could have easily chosen nothing but stoic books. Here’s a good overview of stoicism generally, but at the core of it are three men, each impressive in his own way: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.  While I appreciate all of them, turns out I’m a Seneca guy. It is shocking how modern and relevant his 2,000 year old letters feel. Writing to a young friend and protege, Seneca’s advice has the wisdom and clarity of an older mentor who has been there, wishes he had done better, and now advises his young friend to learn from his experience. Friendly, worldly, but with an unceasing dedication to living a good life, these letters are good for you.

Based on the rest of the list, this may come as something of a surprise entry, but I find the myths in it both beautiful and meaningful. The Germanic myths lack the neat and tidy systemization imposed on Greek myth, leaving them with a raw vitality and tantalizingly missing pieces. With all my focus on rational stoicism and conscious improvement, I find it useful to remember the murkier subconscious parts of my mind that can only be accessed through stories of gods, monsters, and magic. Plus they’re viking myths so they’re super metal. If you’re still not convinced and insist on directly useful, you’ll find fewer collections of wisdom poetry more straightforward than the Havamal.

I know that there’s quite a lot to read here, but these are special and well worth the time. I encourage you to pick just one new book and give it a go today. It just might change your life.

I started reading this book because I've encountered the idea of managing "energy" in several places, and I wanted an adequate description to work with. This book did not disappoint. As I read, I kept thinking "this reminds me of Josh Waitzkin's advice in The Art of Learning, so I went back and checked, and sure enough, he trained with the authors. While the physical and emotional energy stuff is useful, I found this work's definition of "spiritual" as "caring about something larger than yourself beyond your own self-interest" to be the most straightforward and practical definition I've encountered. A lot of ideas from this book have been incorporated elsewhere, but it's full of specific case studies and examples of how the concepts have been applied in a variety of situations. Great stuff.

I've been wanting to read this book ever since listening to James Altucher's <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/podcast/steven-johnson/">interview with the author</a> and it did not disappoint. Wide ranging and diverse in the best possible way, this book draws on examples as diverse as the building of coral reefs and the founding of YouTube to elucidate the components of systems that most reliably produce useful innovation - whether in nature, science, or business. I would have liked just a hair more advice on how to operationalize the concepts, but as a foundation for thinking about hard problems that matter, this book was invaluable.

This book came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine at work and it certainly did not disappoint. It focuses on questions of how objects in our environment can enhance (or detract) from our experience and our lives. Most useful to me was the distinction between <i>affordances</i> and <i>signifiers</i> and the notion of "knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world." If you're even a little bit interested in how the objects, structures, and organizations around you shape your life in subtle ways, you'll thoroughly enjoy this.

I'm not gonna lie to you, friends: I was pretty skeptical of this system when I first heard about it at work. One of my business school professors engrained a deep distrust of "personality types" in general by pointing out that almost all of them except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">The Big Five</a> lack any rigorous empirical testing. That being said, as I read this book, time and again I saw descriptions that rang extremely true for either myself or my loved ones. It's probably easy to take this too far and use it as some kind of universal theory, but it makes an awfully useful heuristic for understanding why you act the way you do, and more importantly, why other people act in such seemingly incomprehensible ways.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-fragility_robustness_and_antifragility">

<b>Date</b> 2017-June-16
</p>

<p>
<a href="#rethinking_risk_with_antifragile">Last time</a>, we discussed a new way of looking at the concept of “risk” and our inability to scientifically define it. Today, we go a little deeper and break systems into three categories based on their exposure to volatility: fragile, robust, and antifragile.
</p>

<p>
First we need to realize that volatility, time, and risk are really the same thing. This sounds bizarre, right? But let’s return to our <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rationality.pdf">least-worst definition of risk</a>: “exposure to negative outcomes brought about by volatility." With this in mind, we can see that given enough time, every possible extreme of volatility will be experienced. To return to our coffee mug example, if you leave that mug on a table in San Francisco, eventually an earthquake will knock it off and break it. So, the combination of its exposure to negative outcomes (falls make it break) plus time (eventually something will happen to knock it off) means that more time equals more likely that it is broken. I should point out, of course, that this concept is statistical and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical">empirical</a> in nature, which has three important implications: 1)it is only really valid probabilistically, 2) it can’t predict the outcome for any one single thing, and 3) it makes no theory-based claims as to why time will eventually break most coffee mugs. 
</p>

<p>
We now know that exposure is the most practical thing to care about, since it definitely matters and we can actually observe it. Contrast this with the other elements of “risk” usually considered - the timing or intensity of the outcomes concerned, which we can’t every really know ahead of time. WIth our focus squarely on exposure, we can now look at how to categorize systems based on exposure, and It turns out that there are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile. The first two will be familiar and intuitively obvious, but this last category is novel and thus gives Taleb’s book its name. Let’s go through what each category means and give some examples.
</p>

<p>
Fragile things are hurt by volatility - eventually something goes wrong and they break. The easy example we’ve been using is the coffee mug. An important concept that we’ve skipped over so far is that these categories are defined by their relationship with volatility, which can be changed by circumstances - it’s not an intrinsic quality, even though some things more inherently tend towards fragility than others. 
</p>

<p>
To understand this distinction, I like to think about <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy">potential energy</a>. A brick sitting on top of a ladder has more potential energy than one sitting on the ground. Nothing about the brick changes except its relationship with the gravity well it’s sitting in. Likewise, with our coffee mug, if you wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuffed it in a box, put that box in a waterproof bag, then put that inside a nuke proof bunker filled with packing peanuts, it would be significantly less fragile than sitting on your coffee table, which is less fragile still than balancing on top of a stack of books as you try to open a door.
</p>

<p>
The most relevant real world examples are traditional stocks and artificial systems that are overly optimized. Sure, traditional stocks go up when volatility goes in their favor, but they go down when it goes down, and you need <a href="http://www.360financialliteracy.org/Topics/Budgeting-Spending/Budgeting-and-Saving/Understanding-the-Math-of-Recovering-from-Losses">bigger growth to offset your loss</a>. Highly optimized systems, on the other hand, work great until they catastrophically don’t. These failures are usually due to an unforeseen change in environmental circumstance or an excess of predicted capacity. Traffic is a great example. Highways don’t get linearly slower as cars are added during rush hour - they go from zooming to standstill exponentially quickly as their capacity is exceeded. If you like guns, think about the (somewhat exaggerated) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16">difference between an M16 and an AK-47</a>: an M16 is more accurate and generally higher functioning, but stops working after much less abuse than the less optimized, cruder AK.
</p>

<p>
So, the AK-47 can be described as “more robust” or “less fragile” than the M16. Robust is usually considered the opposite of fragile, but that’s not quite accurate. Robust things are indifferent to volatility - shit happens and they abide. Volatility neither particularly hurts nor particularly helps them. Think of <a href="http://s1.thingpic.com/images/u3/z7gW8yQ1gQAjKqq9Vmgcf47e.jpeg">Notre Dame</a> in Paris - through centuries of wars, invasions, and revolutions, it has remained beautiful and solid and standing. Sure it’s a little rougher around the edges, but it’s not a pile of rubble. Nor is it larger or more beautiful or superior in some way. It simply is.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to examples of increasing robustness in day to day life, I like to think about my finances and my schedule. As I mentioned before, I keep somewhat large cash savings around, because it makes me more indifferent to volatility. I can pay for the unexpected without indebting myself or scrambling around. Likewise, when scheduling, I build in buffers of time (a trick I originally learned in the army) so that if something unexpected happens (major accident on the freeway, a train stops traffic, there’s a marathon I didn’t know about - whatever) I still get there on time. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we get to the star of the show, the most novel category: antifragile, the true opposite of fragile. Antifragile systems actually benefit from volatility - eventually something will happen that makes them better or stronger. These systems are most often found in nature. Think of your immune system: once you have chicken pox, you’re immune. Or your muscles: lift weights and you get stronger. Most interesting of all, look at evolution: species and even ecosystems get more efficient and better adapted to their environment over time by responding to the various stressors that come up due to volatility.
</p>

<p>
Because this is exciting and sounds like a super power, everyone immediately thinks “how can I be more antifragile?” Well, there’s good and bad news. First off, the bad news is that it is more applicable to systems than to individual entities. The good news is that we create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">systems</a> in our life constantly, and we can engineer those to be as antifragile as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Taleb became wealthy by betting against the market with out of the money put options - when the financial crisis hit and the market tanked, those options paid off. He had no precise knowledge of when a crash would happen or how big it would be, but given enough time it would. So he constructed a system with <a href="http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf">convex exposure</a> where he accepted finite, limited downside constantly for near unlimited upside in the event of volatility. 
</p>

<p>
For ourselves, it helps to remember that robust is usually a necessary stepping stone to antifragile. Remember the savings we talked about? Step 1 is you don’t care about negative outcomes. Step 2 is to create ways to actively benefit from them - such as by buying undervalued stocks when there is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp">“blood in the streets”</a> or setting up positions that automatically benefit like Taleb’s. Or you might find other ways that disorder in your life can benefit you - have something read or listen to whenever you find yourself unexpectedly delayed, for example. Another favorite of mine is to practice Jocko Willink’s habit of responding to all negative situations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8">“Good.”</a> Or perhaps, invest in business ideas that take advantage of the seemingly negative, like staffing agencies in a world of <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/quit-your-job-2017/">declining full time employment</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The basics of Taleb’s framework come pretty easy, but there is so much depth there. For example, I didn’t even touch the <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/taleb_n_1.html">math</a> behind it, because that’s not my forte. I promise that as you think about these concepts, you will begin seeing them in your life and trying to find ways to apply them. If you figure out anything interesting, please let me know!

The core concept explored in this book is what is "risk" and how should we think about it in our lives, but it reaches out and touches so many more areas of interest. Taleb is shockingly smart, enjoyably contrarian, and writes in a very engaging way. This book is one of my top five life and brain changing books - you will be a little bit smarter every time you read it.

<p>
Risk fundamentally shapes some of our most critical decisions, but most of us don’t think very deeply or clearly about it. <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Taleb</a> is not like most of us. he has thought long, hard, and with great rigor about risk and randomness, and he presents that thinking most usefully and straightforwardly in Antifragile. That being said, while his writing and storytelling are superb, it’s not exactly light beach reading. Below we’re going to talk about just one of the many useful concepts presented in the book, which is a fundamentally different way to think about and evaluate risk.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/4orcemajeure/the-james-altucher-show-ep-45-nassim-taleb-why-you-should-embrace-uncertainty">his interview with James Altucher</a> recently, and I was surprised to realize I haven’t written about this book yet. You see, it lives on my shelf of “personal operating manuals” along with <i>Deep Work</i>, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <i>Tools of Titans</i>, and a few others. I am pretty sure that <i>Antifragile</i> is the “80/20” book of his <i>Incerto</i> series - it covers the key concepts, ways to apply them to your life, and just enough of the underlying math to let you know it’s serious (there’s more in the appendix if that gets you going). 
</p>

<p>
Understanding Antifragile requires rethinking the term “risk.” First off, Taleb asserts that there is no such thing as a satisfactory definition of “risk.” Risk as usually defined or described conflates three separate factors - the likelihood of an event, a party’s exposure to that likelihood, and how that party feels about that exposure. Usually you’ll see risk <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html">defined</a> as something like “the likelihood of a negative outcome times its severity.”
</p>

<p>
One problem with this is that “negative outcome” and “severity” can vary enormously depending on the entity experiencing the event. If your coffee cup is knocked off the counter, it’s going to have a bad time. If your cat falls off the counter, it’ll be fine. In both cases the objective event (falling off the counter) is identical, but the entities experiencing it are differently exposed to negative outcomes. When you add in rational thought, you get the further wrinkle that “negative” is a judgment call. While you might think something like “losing money” is intrinsically negative, it’s not so simple. What if I lose money daily but get a huge payout once a year and I’m okay with that? Or what if I decide I’m okay losing the money to have a good time (like a Vegas trip)? 
</p>

<p>
There’s an even thornier challenge besides those above, though: outside of certain fairly constrained bounds, we can’t even accurately model the likelihood of events (we think we can, but we’re very bad at it). Artificial environments that involve chance (like rolling dice or drawing cards) have relatively easy to model probabilities, as do large classes of natural phenomena that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-most-natural-phenomena-when-observed-randomly-tend-to-converge-to-a-normal-distribution-curve-If-so-can-this-be-used-as-a-hypothesis-to-claim-that-nature-follows-a-certain-pattern">fit pretty well</a> into normal distributions. But several classes of events that matter very much to our lives (financial instruments, catastrophic disasters, terrorist attacks, et cetera) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e6UKCJt-g8">cannot have their probability modeled in any meaningful, non-deceiving way</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So where does that leave us for how to think about risk in our own lives? Well, the good news is that while we can’t really nail down a scientific definition of “risk” for the whole wide world, we can do just fine in assessing risk for ourselves. To do so, we need to look at two main factors: how we feel about the outcomes and our exposure to those outcomes taking place. For example, I would very much like to continue living and would find getting killed unambiguously negative. Certain activities, like smoking, riding motorcycles, or going to dangerous neighborhoods dramatically increase my exposure to the outcome of getting killed. I don’t have to have a good model of how likely or unlikely those outcomes are to simply avoid my exposure to that risk.
</p>

<p>
In terms of personal finance, I keep a lot more cash savings than most investing professionals would advise, because savings help make me more robust - I can be more indifferent to the volatility of the world around me. Air conditioning stops working? Cool, I’ve got cash in the bank. Surprise! Nail in your tire - cash. You get the picture. Now, this works the other way as well - you can take some amount of money that you’re okay with losing and invest it in things with a low chance of paying off but with potentially unlimited returns, like out of the money options or start ups or your own entrepreneurial ventures. Taleb calls this the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads">“barbell method”</a> of investing, because he advocates having heavily safe and heavily risky investments, rather than an averaged portfolio like a business school finance class would teach you to go for.
</p>

<p>
This may come as a shock to you, but I also find Tim Ferriss’s definition of risk instructive to combine here - he looks at risk by asking whether or not something irreversible and/or massively negative may happen. By using <a href="http://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/">fear setting</a> to mitigate what you can of the likelihood and alter your perception of the negatives, you will often find that very few actions have truly irreversible massive negative outcomes. This attitude can make it easier to expose yourself to the possible upsides of volatility, such as by encouraging you to build your own business or invest a prudent amount in a highly speculative company. 
</p>

<p>
So how do you apply these concepts? We’ve talked about a few in our examples above, but here’s my top pics for most useful ways to re-think your approach to risk in your life:
</p>

<p>
Career: Corporate jobs are generally viewed as “safe” because there is very little volatility in your paycheck. Until it’s totally gone. Maybe you get laid off, or maybe you happened to be working for Enron. If this happens when you’re 23, it’s not such a big deal, but if it happens right before retirement, it can be devestating. Compare this with a skilled individual worker or independent consultant, and their pay is much more variable day to day and month to month, but they have a much tighter feedback loop: as long as you keep getting clients, you’re doing something valuable. When you start losing your ability to find them, it’s a sign you need to move on and find a new gig. 
</p>

<p>
Investing: Before we get into this, please bear in mind I am not an investment advisor of any sort, and this does not constitute specific financial advice - this paragraph is just a recommendation on where to look to learn more, not specific investment strategies. As mentioned above, a traditionally balanced portfolio basically says “let’s get rid of all the volatility except what’s inherent in the market.” The trouble is, there’s a whole damn lot of volatility inherent in the market, especially when you are looking only at equity. Much better to figure out however much money you need to not be ruined and protect it from volatility the best you can (Inflation-protected Treasuries or the like) and take whatever is left over and put it into things where you have exposure to the potential for massive upside - investing in your friend’s genius start up, opening a restaurant, writing a novel, out of the money options, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
Health and Behavior: There are some things that can greatly affect our exposure to negative health outcomes - like the previously mentioned smoking or engaging in dangerous stunts. Many of these you can completely opt out of and face no risk - which is the approach recommended by Taleb. You’ll have to decide for yourself if a non-zero chance of horrible death is worth the benefits of doing things like motorcycle riding or sky diving. On the more positive side, doing things like lifting heavy weights and walking frequently have close to zero downside (some chance of injury with weight lifting), but potentially tremendous upside to your health long term. 
</p>

<p>
This is just the tip of the iceberg with Taleb’s material, and I strongly recommend you check out not only Antifragile, but the rest of the Incerto series. We haven’t even gotten into just what “Antifragility” is, but I wanted to cover the basic approach to risk and provide some tangible ways to use it first. Let me know if you’re interested in diving deeper on this topic, and we’ll make a series of it.

The core thesis of this book is that <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull/">goals are for losers, systems are for winners, and passion is bullshit</a>. When I finally got around to actually reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely jam packed with useful little nuggets. Seriously, this is one of the highest "actionable stuff to fluff" self-improvement books I've ever read. While it is full of specific tactics, the real value of this book is how it points out the complex system that leads to your energy, output, and ultimately success.

I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but to be perfectly honest, I was worried it was one of those books where if you know the premise you don't need to read it. What I had overlooked is the degree to which making the case for checklists would motivate me to actually change my behavior. The examples given of lives saved and fortunes made through the seemingly simple expedient of using checklists are quite impressive. Plus, there's a neat checklist for creating your own checklist in the back.
</p>

If you want to up your game to true professionalism in just about any field, check out this book.

This book might seem out of left field for those of you outside of the military or law enforcement, but I think it has several valuable lessons for everybody. First off, it will help you to understand many of the dynamics going on - on both sides - of the deadly force encounters you hear about in the news. Secondly, it's breakdown of the physical, psychological, and environmental factors of the most extreme kind of stress can be reverse-engineered to the more mild kinds of stress most of us are lucky enough to deal with. Finally, it just might help you prepare for unlikely but terrible life-threatening situations.

I've been a fan of Ferriss for years, but I think this book is far and away his best yet. It's chock full of great stuff that you can use right now to make your life better - whether to get healthy, make money, or feel more calm in your life. If you only ever read one book of his, make it this one. Hell, if you only read one self-improvement book period, make it this one.

This book is a classic for a reason - I've taken my sweet ass time getting to it, but I am absolutely hooked. Drawing on a combination of scholarly experiments and "in the trenches" experience with sales training, this book points out thenearly automatic triggers we have evolved to be good, cooperative members ofsociety and how "compliance professionals" (salesmen, recruiters, and cons) use these techniques to get their way without you even knowing what they're about. This book is doubly valuable - you learn how to spot unscrupulous applications of the techniques as well as how to use them in your own (hopefully legitimate) endeavors. For lots of interesting extra context, check out Scott Adams's <a href="http://goldmine.marketing/scott-adams-original-persuasion-reading-list-from-2016/">Persuasion Reading List</a>.

By now, you've probably heard about how bad sitting is for you, and maybe you've even seen or used a standing desk somewhere. Well, this book lays down the case for why sitting is literally killing us in stark, terrifying detail, and proceeds to provide specific, step by step instructions on how to do something about it. It's not as simple as buying a standing desk and burning your chair - you have to re-teach your body appropriate ways of moving after years oflearning the wrong thing. Fortunately, the prescriptions in this book are easy to follow and will give you immediate relief as well as long-lasting solutions to problems like stiff backs, joint pain, and chronic stress.

<p>
In this book, Harris makes a case for spiritual practice without the scaffolding and foundation of religious beliefs. While he approaches it as an avowed and enthusiastic atheist, I think that the core insight that there are certain practices you can adopt to bring peace, contentment, and compassion into your life without adopting beliefs you are uncomfortable with is useful regardless of your religious convictions. The descriptions of what it feels like to meditate and what it feels like to think you're meditating when you aren't really are worth the price of admission by themselves.

My name is Jeff Russell. This webstead is my home on the internet. I plan to share my thoughts on the many things I'm interested in. Hopefully you'll find them interesting too.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've had somewhat sundered "selves" on the web - I had a blog and social media account for gaming, another blog and webstead for coaching and thoughts on business and getting more work done and such, and I've lurked around reading but not putting out there my interests in things like philosophy, magic, and religion. After listening to Naval Ravikant <a href="https://nav.al/rich">talk about</a> why you want to welcome and make the most out of what you have that no one else does, and to Josh Waitzkin <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/06/19/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-distilled/">talk about</a> how greatness comes from "embracing your funk", I made up my mind to set that right - hence, here we are, with one stead to put all of those many interests.  
</p>

<p>
This webstead is largely built following the advice in <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed to Last</a> by Jeff Huang. That's why almost everything is on one page, the formatting is minimal, and the html/css is as simple and vanilla as I can make it.
