<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-looking_into_the_our_father">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-21
</p>

<p>
After my <a href="#lessons_learned_on_prayer_from_the_council_of_trent">earlier post</a> on the Catechism of the Council of Trent about the section "On Prayer", I went ahead and read through the rest of the section, which is a line-by-line treatment of the "Our Father". The catechism uses this prayer as an example of a single, sufficient prayer for Christian practice. While I am not a Christian, I find the thought of having one prayer that is a wholly sufficient baseline an especially interesting one, and I thought that it would be helpful to look in detail at what the Council of Trent had to say about the "Our Father". 
</p>

<p>
Since I'm not a Christian, my main interest is in thinking through what crafting such a prayer for another faith might mean. Of course, I'm especially interested in coming up with such a prayer for my own faith, but to try to make this helpful for others, I'd like to generalize as much as possible.  Lastly, though much of the prayer is particularly Christian, there is much within the prayer that is inspiring and beautiful for any spiritual path, and might be worth thinking through how to emulate in other faiths, and I'd like to highlight that as well.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6922a99" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6922a99">The Progression of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6922a99">
<p>
The Council of Trent broke down the prayer line-by-line and talked about what each line meant on its own, but also as a logical progression. The heart of it seems to be that you start universal, end universal, and have more particular asks sandwiched in-between. Each thing asked for also works both as a "plain" request for something obvious, and as a more sophisticated spiritual statement.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org87207b6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org87207b6">Our Father, Who Art in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org87207b6">
<p>
The prayer begins by calling upon a loving father, not a harsh or distant lord. By specifying "our" father, the prayer also acknowledges that all men are brothers, and God is the father of all. Since Christians believe God to be everywhere, "Who art in Heaven" at first doesn't make much sense, but it serves to draw attention to the noblest part of visible nature, the sky, and asks those praying to compare that with God. More personally, by placing the highly personal figure of a "father" in the highly spiritual locale of "heaven", the prayer immediately establishes a link between personal practice and the transcendental goods sought through spiritual practice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf81558f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf81558f">Hallowed Be Thy Name</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf81558f">
<p>
The Council of Trent recognizes that God's name can be nothing but hallowed in an abstract sense, but instead frames this bit of the prayer as a recognition, and a plea by the one praying to treat the name of God as holy. More subtly, the Council argues that all things that are good and hallowed are encompassed by God's name, and that this part of the prayer recognizes that. It also serves as a reminder to those praying to try to bring holiness to God's name through their actions outside of prayer, which will serve as an encouragement to any folks whose belief might be wavering.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0c5d491" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0c5d491">Thy Kingdom Come</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0c5d491">
<p>
The Council of Trent puts this forward as the highest possible good and says that it holds all other goods that might possibly be asked for - anything that might be truly good is actually a part of the Kingdom of God, and anything not a part of the Kingdom of God only seems good, but isn't truly so. This part of the prayer is meant to remind believers to notice how much better the goods of the Kingdom of Heaven are than the goods of this world, but also as an encouragement to bring as much of the Kingdom of God into the world as possible.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a726d6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7a726d6">Thy Will Be Done</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7a726d6">
<p>
This is one that is seemingly at first the most strongly associated with purely Christian theology, yet that maybe has useful lessons for other faiths as well. The core idea is that the one praying ought to acknowledge that what he thinks he wants might actually not be such a great idea, and instead that he should gladly accept what the God prayed to believes to be best. Christians justify this position with original sin - because you are fundamentally flawed and cut off from the Divine, whatever you will to happen is tainted, and so you should instead seek the will of the higher power, who is untainted. Even without original sin, though, you can pretty readily get to the idea that what we think is best might not have all the needed information. The world is a big, complicated place, and we are just some moderately clever social apes - why on earth would we think that we know what's best for us? If you believe in the idea of a God or Gods at all, you should trust that they know a bit better than we do, from our highly limited material points of view.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgff1c5a8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgff1c5a8">On Earth as It Is in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgff1c5a8">
<p>
This bit was especially interesting to me, as I learned something I hadn't ever considered before: the Council of Trent says that "On Earth as It Is in Heaven" applies equally to "Hallowed be Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," and "Thy will be done." I had always only read it as an extension of "Thy will be done" and nothing else. On the one hand, this clause acknowledges the contrast between that which is spiritual and that which is worldly, but on the other, it also works as a thanksgiving, to the degree that God's name is hallowed, His kingdom has come, and His will is done in this world. More broadly, it acknowledges the perfection of Heaven and the lack of perfection in the material world and expresses longing for the material world becoming more like the perfect spiritual world.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga17865e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga17865e">Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga17865e">
<p>
Here we at last come to the asking for day-to-day, bodily things. One of the points the Council of Trent makes is exactly that the asking for bodily things comes only after asking for the highest and most spiritual things. I also appreciate the amount of meaning they find in the few words in this line. Asking for "our" daily bread acknowledges that you have to work, but you also rely on God's help for anything good that comes into your life. Asking for "daily" bread acknowledges that you're asking for what you need everyday - necessities, not luxuries. "This day" acknowledges that what you had yesterday might not come automatically today - you can't take these things for granted and should keep on being thankful so long as you have what you need. Lastly, "Give us" rather than "give me" encourages the one praying to think not only of himself, but of the needs of all of his fellow men.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not Christian, this is an impressive amount of religious meaning to pack into one line! I think it's maybe significant that we're really getting to the richest lines of the prayer when we turn from asking for high-level spiritual goods to normal, earthly needs.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org184911b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org184911b">Forgive Us Our Trespasses as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org184911b">
<p>
This might be considered the heart of the Christian belief system, and might be the part of the prayer least easily adapted to other beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I think that forgiveness is an important part of many religious beliefs, but in Christianity, it is <i>the</i> belief, and so the line in the most common Christian prayer that most directly deals with forgiveness deserves a bit of attention. Once again, the plural subject ("forgive <b>us our</b> trespasses as <b>we</b> forgive those who trespass against <b>us</b>") does a lot of heavy lifting - this is not only asking for help with one's own forgiveness, but for all of mankind to get better at this very hard skill. Like other parts of the prayer, this one acknowledges the work done by both the one praying and God, in partnership. Lastly, one thought I found especially helpful from the Catechism was that folks might avoid saying the whole prayer, or at least this bit, if they had folks they couldn't yet forgive. In other words, if someone had someone against whom they were still nursing a grudge, they might hold off saying the "Our Father", or at least the line about forgiving trespasses. The Council of Trent very strongly came down on the belief that this was a mistake. More broadly, I think the idea that we ought to pray for the things we <i>wish</i> were true about us, even if we currently fall short, is a useful one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org609da9b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org609da9b">And Lead Us Not Into Temptation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org609da9b">
<p>
This is another bit where the Council of Trent makes some rather Christian assumptions - that "temptation" is something the Devil does and that is an unquestionable feature of existence. That being said, I think anyone who has been alive past childhood has experienced the draw of thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors that some part of them more readily dismisses. What I thought was most helpful in the Council of Trent's analysis was the notion that temptation is an intrinsic part of being alive, and so no amount of prayer will get you to a life "without temptation" - instead, the goal is no more temptation than you can handle with God's help. This seems both a) much  more do-able, and b) more consistent with other theological interpretations. For example, Christian theology might have it that making love to a bunch of strangers is lustful and therefore bad. On the other hand, if you belong to a belief that has looser beliefs about sex, you might still believe that having sex with strangers might be bad if a) you've pledged yourself to someone else, or b) it gets in the way of forming a more serious relationship with one person. In this case, the "temptation" to have sex with multiple new folks might still be very strong, but the Christian and non-Christian beliefs about why it should be avoided would be different, even if they came up with the same recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I appreciate the reminder that this part of the prayer is useful both for dealing with "avoiding temptation" in the abstract, or in general, and also in the moment to resist specific temptations. Whatever negative stuff you want to avoid, you should likely pray for daily, as well as whenever you find yourself needing help in the moment.

<div id="outline-container-orgecf97a3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgecf97a3">But Deliver Us From Evil</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgecf97a3">
<p>
Much as "Thy Kingdom Come" holds all of the good you might ask for in any prayer, so "deliver us from evil" holds the wish to have everything not good taken away. In some sense, everything asked for above is held within this - as all of the good things asked for are, in fact, the lack of evil. One nice thing about this bit of the prayer is that folks tend to pray to get rid of what's wrong anyway, even if not especially religious ("no atheists in foxholes" and so forth). All that being said, this bit of the prayer is at the end, because asking for spiritual goods is more important overall. Also, some seeming "evils" might actually be good for our souls. Lastly, this says "from <b>Evil</b>", rather than "from <b>evils</b>", as Christianity sees all evil as coming from one source (the devil), and acknowledges that some material circumstances might seem evil, while actually being good for you - this way of praying allows for experiencing things that seem crappy in the moment, but might be for the best in the long run.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orged58ee9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orged58ee9">Amen</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orged58ee9">
<p>
The prayer ends with a word rich with weight from scripture. Most importantly, "amen" works as a "seal" to mark the prayer as done, but with a feeling of gladness. In Catholic ceremonies, the congregation does not say "amen", but instead the priest says "amen" back to them, which they treat as a sign that the prayer has been heard and will be acted upon. According to the Council, even when praying alone, "amen" can work as a glad celebration of coming closer to God, a reminder of what the prayer just finished was truly for.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge04fd65" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge04fd65">The Theology of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge04fd65">
<p>
Now, one thing I kept running into while reading the Council's analysis was that their arguments were cogent, coherent, and self-consistent - <i>if you accept Christian theology</i>. If your beliefs differ, it's a bit less helpful. Even so, I think that identifying the main strands of theological belief will be helpful in coming up with what others might get out of an analysis of the "Our Father".
</p>

<p>
First off, the prayer is assumed to be directed to the single source of all goodness, God. If you are coming from a non-monotheistic standpoint, you might see the value in having a single source of all goodness, but you might not attribute it to a single "God". Regardless of what this source of all goodness is, the prayer opens by addressing it joyfully, follows up by wishing for it to be realized in the world as much as possible, and then acknowledges that all day-to-day material goods also come from this source of all goodness, and closes by acknowledging that we all fall short of what we would like, and asking for help in doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, since this is, in fact, a Christian prayer, we have to deal with concept of original sin. Original sin is implicit in much of the prayer, and explored in more depth by the Council's analysis. The entire prayer basically assumes that the one praying is in a fallen state and needs redemption, and that this prayer is one of the chief tools in seeking and achieving that end. Obviously this comes out most clearly in the lines about forgiving trespasses, leading not into temptation, and delivering from evil. As I'll get into below, this strikes me as likely one of the biggest theological differences another faith would have to work around if looking for inspiration from this prayer. Related to this is the single source of all Evil mentioned above, which has a certain tidiness to it, but again, doesn't jive with everyone's view of the world.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, much of the prayer expects those praying to do their share of the work, which I find quite interesting, and likely useful to apply outside of a Christian context. Though God is acknowledged as all powerful and the author of all good things, at least according to the Council of Trent, the one praying still has to do work and pray and believe and otherwise live consistently with what's being asked for, rather than just sitting back and waiting for God to handle everything. That might be the element of the Council's analysis that I found most interesting - it consistently stressed the active, engaged role folks need to take to get the most of prayer specifically and their spiritual life more broadly.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78f6898" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78f6898">What Can We Learn for Other Faiths?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78f6898">
<p>
Despite the challenges of generalizing from a strongly Christian starting point, I think that there are some helpful lessons for crafting prayers for other faiths. Structurally speaking, I rather like the progression of the "Our Father" - as mentioned above, it begins by naming to Whom the prayer is addressed, asks for/affirms faith in the highest good things that Being can give, goes into more earthly requests, and closes with another universal, but this time "flipped" (deliver us from Evil rather than grant us the Kingdom of Heaven). So, I think that following the structure for prayers in other faiths would not present too much of a challenge, and could even be followed pretty closely, if wanted, by substituting in things appropriate to the Being prayed to. My <a href="#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of Fallhall's Prayer</a> is pretty close to that.
</p>

<p>
What gives a bit more of a challenge is looking at the prayer's theology and thinking through how to craft a prayer that fulfills a <i>functional</i> role similar to what the "Our Father" does for Christianity, even if it's actual structure is different - ideally, one that also functions as a "single, sufficient prayer" for a different system of belief. Drawing on the theological threads we stepped through above, the three core things we identified the prayer doing functionally are 1) acknowledging/celebrating the source of all Goodness, 2) seeking redemption as a sinful being in a fallen world, and 3) calling upon the one praying to show his faith and belief by living a life consistent with what is asked for in the prayer. 
</p>

<p>
These are highly specific to the Christian faith, and if we want to write a prayer for another faith, we'll have to express some different things. So, I've taken the three threads above and generalized them further: 1) is either the highest good, its source, or both, 2) is whatever this faith most seeks, what "problem it solves", and 3) is an affirmation to live consistent with your beliefs. For example, for Druidry, 1) might be the concept Awen, 2) might be knowledge, power, and peace, and 3) might be asking to live in harmony with nature. This might be harder for religions that don't have something as clear cut that they seek as Christianity is about seeking forgiveness for sins, or a more multi-faceted concept about what the highest good is or where it comes from.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I haven't worked out a prayer for my own beliefs following these recommendations yet, but I am glad I went through this exercise, I think it's been a helpful step, and I look forward to coming up with something.

<h2 id="the_hail_idun_prayer" class="Post">The "Hail Idun" Prayer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_hail_idun_prayer">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-14
</p>

<p>
Keeping on with taking Christian prayers and writing a Heathen prayer as close to their shapes as I can, I've taken the "Hail Mary" and written the "Hail Idun". Idun is very important to me and my spiritual practice, and I think it likely that once I get to my goal of a full "Heathen Rosary", some kind of "Hail Idun" (whether this, or in Germanic metre or something else) will likely be the heart of the practice.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org75b12fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org75b12fd">Hail Idun</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75b12fd">

Hail Idun<br />

<p>
<i>*Brego is possibly an Old English form of Bragi, God of Poetry and Idun's husband, who may or may not be a hypostasis of Odin/Woden. I picked it because it sounded better than "Bragi" to me.
**Wen is one take on the plural of *Wan, the hypothetical Old English form of the Old Norse Vanr, Vanir. Others suggest "Wanes", though there's no direct textual evidence for the word either way in Old English, and some folks question whether the Anglo-Saxons believed in the same two tribes of Gods as the Old Norse did.</i>

<p>
After asking for some resources on prayer on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/190418.html?thread=32258258#cmt32258258">past Magic Monday</a>, samchevre pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_catechism_of_the_Council_of_Trent/Part_4">The Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>. Sure enough, despite its explicit Catholic Christian focus, I found a lot of good thinking on prayer as a practice, and I'd like to share what I thought were the most helpful takeaways for folks of any faith.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc38af56" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc38af56">1. Kinds of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc38af56">
<p>
<b>Asking for Things</b>: Maybe the most common kind of prayer, the Council of Trent held that it was right and proper to ask God in prayer for anything it was right for folks to have. While it is certainly possible to ask for the wrong kind of things in prayer, and it takes some practice to ask for the right kind of things (more on both below), the evidence we have from just about every spiritual tradition that has recorded prayers shows folks asking the Gods for things that they want. If done right, this is not just a "gimme, gimme!" or a business transaction, but instead a way of acknowledging that you can't do <i>anything</i> in the world without your wider context and the help of the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thanksgiving</b>: Even if you are uncomfortable with asking for things in prayer, I think it's hard, if not impossible, to find anything wrong with prayers of thanksgiving. Even materialists <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-happiness-research/">acknowledge how worthwhile being consciously thankful is</a>. Even more so than asking for things in prayer, giving thanks for what you have in this life is a good way to acknowledge that you are dependent on wider and higher things.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf430ee4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf430ee4">2. Outcomes of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf430ee4">
<p>
<b>Bringing You Closer to the Holy</b>: I think the biggest thing prayer does for you is to bring you closer to the Holy and open you up to its influence. However you pray, it's a way to take some time to think about and reach out to whatever you think of as Holy, and hopefully to listen for some kind of answer. Many spiritual practices can do this, but prayer has the strengths of being ready to do whenever and wherever you are, and being changeable to whatever your needs are right now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acknowledging Something Greater than Yourself</b>: I talked about this in both kinds of prayer above, but most any kind of prayer leads you to acknowledge that you need the wider world and its God(s). Even for things you did "by yourself", you still have your parents, teachers, employers, and culture to thank, to say nothing of any Gods or Goddesses. While humility can go too far into abasing yourself or groveling, most of us can use a timely reminder that we are not an island and that the world has given us a great many gifts that we ought to be thankful for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Giving a Gift</b>: Prayer can also be a gift to the Gods, the same as incense or a candle or mead. The more care and thought you put into the prayer, and the better it is said, the better it works as such. This is the most helpful when you lack the means to give something else, but is still worthwhile even if you have all of the offerings you might wish for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Helping the Dead</b>: Most faiths believe that the dead can use some help in the afterlife, and that prayer is one way of offering that help. For Christians, you pray for souls in Purgatory, other faiths might pray for souls to learn the lessons of their past life as smoothly as they might so they can move on to another life, and so forth. Whatever you believe about the afterlife (well, I guess, unless you don't believe in one), it seems that prayer is helpful to those in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1cf2fd6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1cf2fd6">3. How to Pray</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cf2fd6">
<p>
<b>Prayer Works Best as a Habit</b>: The Catechism talks about prayer as a "duty", not something nice-to-have or optional. I don't know if that way of thinking is true for all faiths, but I think it is very much true that prayer works best as a habit, something you do at least every day. Much of the good of prayer only seems to come when you have done it for awhile with unalike things going on in your life. From what I have seen, it seems best to find many little ways to bring prayer into your life - something to say when you wake up, when you go to sleep, before you eat, when you put on a worn holy symbol, and so forth, as well as a "main" prayer set aside as its own thing. Of course, all of this doesn't have to be piled on at once, as that's not how good habit-building works, but over time, adding such things helps to make prayer a given, rather than something that takes will and forethought.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pray in the Right Frame of Mind with the Right Feeling</b>: For Christians, the Council of Trent recommends that Christians go into prayer with 1) utmost humilty, 2) sorrow or regret for sins done, 3) a lack of unworthy feelings like wrath or pride, and 4) faith in God. Once praying, the prayer should be heartfelt, with the ideal being that you "pour out" what is in your heart and soul with great warmth. I feel like the strong weight put on humility and sinfulness may not fit with every other faith, but the heart of the thought, that you should put yourself in a frame of mind in keeping with what is best to your Gods and then pray earnestly and with true feeling, seems like a good one to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ask for the Right Things</b>: The Catechism gave what struck me as a remarkably good rede about asking for things in prayer. First, get in the habit of asking God(s) for all things that you want in your life. Second, practice only asking for things that bring you closer to God(s). This is a really good way to build habits - you start by harnessing your natural yearning to have stuff to get you to pray often. Hopefully, as you do this, you start thinking about and acknowledging the role of the Holy in bringing good things into your life. Having gotten used to thinking about God(s) shaping what comes into your life, you can more readily think about what kinds of things God(s) might most want you to do in the world, and you can start asking for that. Through this change, you learn to ask for the right things, which makes even your prayers asking for stuff into a way to come closer to the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Prayer Becoming a Way to Do Unworthy Things</b>: For all the good that prayer can and does do, it can also become hollow, or even worse, truly harmful. If you only say the words or go through the motions, not only won't you get much out of prayer, you might sour on it or even on the Holy. There's some place for "fake it till you make it" in any kind of habit building, but if prayer feels hollow for a long time, it's likely not doing you any good, and you might need to work out a new way of doing things. Still worse is if you let prayer become a tool for your pride - showing off, making a big fuss about how strong your belief is, or the like. The Council refers to Jesus's well-known rede to pray indoors, out of the public eye. I think there's a role for public prayer, but a good rule of thumb seems to be that if you <i>only</i> pray when others are watching, you're likely doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Lone Sufficient Prayer Can Be Helpful to Have</b>: The Catechism puts forth the "Our Father" as a wholly sufficient prayer by itself. In other words, as a Christian, if you only pray the Our Father, you're doing everything you need to do with prayer. Other prayers are helpful and do a lot of good, of course, but they say that you only really <i>need</i> this one prayer. I found this a highly interesting thought. I think it would be very helpful to look at your faith and ask yourself "if I could only say one prayer for the rest of this life, and I wanted to get at everything that is most important in my faith, what would that prayer be?" I think that most faiths likely don't have a ready-to-go answer the way Christianity does (perhaps the "Bond Among Druids" for Revival Druidry), but that writing it would be a worthy goal to strive for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some Hands-On Tips</b>: The Council also gave a handful of more hands-on tips that I thought were helpful: 1) "Mental Prayer" (praying without speaking out loud) not only works, but is often best suited to sharing strong, deep feelings. That being said, praying out loud helps you stay focused and can be a spur to feelings of devotion. 2) Food and drink can make it harder to have the right mindset or feeling for prayer, so it might be best to pray without having eaten or had drinks besides water for some time. Fasting can also bring on an even stronger feeling for prayer. 3) Try to make your deeds outside of prayer line up with what you ask for in prayer. If you ask for help, but give no help to others, you shouldn't think that will work out well for you.

This started out as at least half a joke, but as I worked through it, I was like "huh, maybe this isn't all bad". The Lord's Prayer is one of the few pieces of my lukewarm Christian upbringing that really stuck in my mind, and I've always appreciated its cadence, so I tried to keep that as much as possible here while making the concepts fitting for a prayer to Woden. That being said, I'm <i>really</i> new at this prayer/poetry thing, so I'm sure I'll look back at this in a bit and cringe.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Allfather, who art in Fallhall,<br />
Awesome be Thy name.<br />
Thy walkyries come, Thy will be done,<br />
On fields choosing the winners.<br />
Teach us this day our daily lore,<br />
And welcome us as wayfarers,<br />
As we welcome those who wayfare amongst us.<br />
Lead us not into shamefulness,<br />
And unshackle us from fetters.<br />
For Thine is the wisdom,<br />
and the greatness, and the lordship,<br />

Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.
</p>

<p>
It is the thrown-out plastic water bottle in an otherwise spotless stream. It is the streaming comedy that rings brittle and hollow. It is the buzzing of a notification for a social media app. It is the sneering look of cynical contempt that curdles a young face.
</p>

<p>
Call it ennui. Call it anomie. Call it nihilism. Call it by whichever French philosophical word you like. It is an <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">Immoral Maze</a>. It is <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk</a>. It is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.
</p>

<p>
So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-destinations_and_journeys">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-22
</p>

<p>
The other day, I read <a href="https://open-space.dreamwidth.org/8001.html">this post</a> the other day by an online acquaintance, which reinforced the old-but-good maxim that it is not the destination that matters, but rather the journey. I agree with this, but in responding to the post, I had a few thoughts on it that I thought I'd get down and post here.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2cd3914" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cd3914">The Destination is not the <i>Goal</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cd3914">
<p>
So, you've likely heard some variation of this fortune-cookie-style wisdom before, that the journey is what matters, not where you're going. As I said above, I think this is mostly true and worth keeping in mind, since our psychology and society often push us into laser-focusing on the destination with remarkable tunnel vision. It's helpful to be reminded that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo">"life moves pretty fast - if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."</a> Also, every single successful person you ever talk to will tell you that the experience of achieving what they were after was nowhere near as engaging and interesting as the pursuit. Also, paradoxically, if you start out overly focused on outcomes and end points, you might just miss out on developing what you need to develop to even reach them at all. Often, focusing on the process instead of the goal is <i>how</i> you get to the goal at all. But notice in all of these examples, we're still talking about goals and destinations, they're still assumed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org862b6aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org862b6aa">Destinations are <i>Excuses</i> for Journeys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org862b6aa">
<p>
Okay, so journeys = good and destinations = bad, right? We should just stop setting goals or having specific places to go, right? Well, maybe not so much. There's a difference between a journey and wandering - the destination. So, we have a bit of a paradox. We want to value destinations less than journeys, but we need destinations to have journeys. What I realized in responding to my friend's post is that destinations are <i>excuses</i> for journeys - necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for what we're looking for. I keep having this insight over and over again playing with my daughter - I'll get frustrated that she's being slow to take her turn on Candy Land, or that she gets distracted by a stick while kicking her soccer ball into a goal. On my better days, though, I'll catch myself and realize "oh, right, achieving the 'goal' of this activity isn't actually why we're doing this, it's so that she can have fun and spend time with me and learn things". Another helpful example for me is playing games. Within the game itself, sure, you're playing to win, but you're <i>really</i> playing the game to have fun with your friends, so you likely shouldn't act like a dick to try to win. So how do we recognize that we need destinations so that we'll take journeys, while not attaching too much importance to them?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga49e706" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga49e706">How Do you Balance these?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga49e706">
<p>
I like to think about it as something similar to the advice to have "strong opinions, loosely held" that you'll run into in the startup world. It's helpful to have specific goals or destinations, maybe even ambitious ones, but not to focus on them so hard that you lose sight of what's around you on the way. One thing I think helps do this is to be suspicious of "efficiency", when that means "get to the outcome as fast as possible". Sure, sometimes efficiency is worthwhile, but only when it is compatible with whatever other goals or values the journey might be meant to support. If you purposely chose to take the scenic route for the sights and stops, it's foolish to speed once you get on it. If you asked your kid to help clean up so she learns to be helpful and responsible, then it's dumb to do things for her because she's slow about it. If you started a company to have freedom and autonomy, it's foolish to take a deal that puts you in someone else's pocket. So, to properly value the journey, we have to think about not where we're going, but why we chose that end point in the first place, and be ready to adjust along the way.

<h2 id="reading_goal_for_2022" class="Post">Reading Goal for 2022</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reading_goal_for_2022">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-05
</p>

<p>
This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:
</p>

<p>
<i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i>
</p>

<p>
I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?
</p>

<p>
A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="https://fs.blog/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/#2-the-lindy-effect">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.
</p>

<p>
So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

</p>

<p>
For now, I'm lucky enough to get to share my thoughts with students every semester. That being said, there's a lot of stuff that I think is really helpful that I can't justify sharing in my course, as it's not so much about "business" or "communication". So, I reckoned I'd gather up that kind of thing here. Mostly, it's stuff I wish I had known when I was younger, so it ought to be very helpful to young folks. On the other hand, I wasn't all that young when I learned a lot of this, so you might still find something helpful here even if you're not so young.
</p>

<p>
Given that this is the internet, and that I teach at a university, I feel like I have to say clearly that these are my own views, and not those of my employer. I've posted them here to help maintain some of that distance. If you see anything here that upsets you, I'd like to hear from you so we can talk it over, especially if you're one of my students.

<h4 id="org6df6d3d">Learn and Use Mental Models</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6df6d3d">
<p>
My good friend Jonathan introduced me to "mental models", which are perhaps best explained by the blog <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a>, but here's the short version: different fields have their own ways of thinking about the world, and many of these ways can be applied outside of their home field. Naming these ways of thinking as more-or-less contained "models" makes it easier to remember and apply them in a variety of situations. The other reason it's helpful to think of them as separate "models" is that it reminds you that they are just that: useful abstractions that help you understand the world, not the raw, objective truth.

<h4 id="org7734135">Learn How to Read a Book</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7734135">
<p>
Anyone who wants to read books for more than fun needs to read <i>How to Read a Book</i> by Adler and Van Doren. If you haven't read it, your education has a serious gap. They break down reading into four levels: 1) Elementary, 2) Inspectional, 3) Analytical, 4) Syntopic. 1) <i>Elementary reading</i> is what you learned in grade school: marks on a page form meaningful words - that's all most folks know how to do. 2) <i>Inspectional reading</i> could be called "intelligent skimming" - you shoot to get the most out of a book in a fixed amount of time. 3) <i>Analytical reading</i> is where things get interesting. This is when you want to get the most out of a book, <i>period</i>. You take all the time you need to grok it in fullness. 4) <i>Syntopic reading</i> is when you want to understand a concept or field of study and so you read a lot of works by different authors and make sense of them all together. Even if you don't follow the exact scheme of this book or the techniques it outlines, I think it is very useful to have an idea of different levels of reading depending on what you're trying to do, and to apply them intentionally.

<h4 id="org24f31f5">Use Divergence and Convergence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org24f31f5">
<p>
I was introduced to this pair of concepts by my former boss Tony, who learned them by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Basadur">Dr. Min Basadur</a> and becoming certified in his creative problem solving approach (which is currently called <a href="https://www.basadur.com/simplexity/">"Simplexity"</a>). In creative thinking, you have two processes which are both necessary, but are better done separately: "diverging" and "converging". <i>Diverging</i> is where you try to generate as many options as possible. <i>Convergence</i> is when you evaluate the options generated and try to pick the best ones based on whatever criteria is relevant. These two ways of thinking use very different mental processes, and they interfere with each other. This approach applies in a surprisingly broad number of fields: in writing, you want to write a crappy first draft and edit, if you're figuring out where to go to dinner with your friends, throw out any options you can think of without worrying about if any of them are 'good', and only <i>then</i> pick something from that list. So, any time you're trying to solve a problem, first come up with as many options as you can, pause, and then look at those options and ask which ones work. Repeat as needed.

<h4 id="org4374b81">Seek Out Old, Weird Things</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4374b81">
<p>
Don't waste your time trying to fit in. Not because fitting in isn't important - it is. But that shit will take care of itself. Even the weirdest, most against-the-grain bastard you can think of is still a product of his time and culture. So, unless you are already a hermit living deep in the woods, cultivate an interest in the obscure, the far off, and the long ago. Even though there are certain charms to eccentricity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYpsdBJlBcU">in and of itself</a>, that's not what I'm pushing here. In a big, highly-linked world, your best hope for being valuable is to bring a combination of talents and knowledge to the table that <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/navals-writing">no one else has</a>, not by doing what everyone around you is doing. The two best heuristics I know of for making this happen are to go after what is weird and what is old. When you start poking around weird/old things, you're going to run into a lot of mularkey, but this is actually a feature, not a bug - you get to practice evaluating sources and how they fit in with what else you know. If everything you encounter fits into a neat, coherent system without this work, you are missing or distorting large chunks of reality, because reality is messy. What do I mean by "weird"? Anything that would get a snooty look at a cocktail party is a good start - cryptids, UFOs, alternate versions of history, magic, conspiracies, and so forth. Am I saying you should <i>believe</i> all of this stuff? Of course not. The idea is to expose yourself to ways of thinking that are very different from what you'll usually encounter - sometimes, when used carefully, some of those ways of thinking are useful. And that leaves "old", this one is simpler - if it was written before you were born, chances are pretty good that it contains some ways of looking at the world that seem pretty alien to you, which again, is the point of the exercise.

<h4 id="org9017f75">Learn and Recognize the Three Economies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9017f75">
<p>
I encountered this model in John Michael Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition/9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</a>, which itself draws heavily on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E.F. Schumacher</a>. The book was helpful for a variety of reasons, but the best bit was a mental model (see above). Greer breaks down "the economy" into three separate economies that work very differently: the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Economies. I'll start in the middle with the most familiar: the <i>Secondary Economy</i> is the economy of goods and services. I cut up meat to sell to the baker and use the proceeds to buy the products of the candlestick maker. Economics as a field is very good at analyzing the Secondary Economy, but tends not to think much about the <i>Primary Economy</i>, which is everything the natural world does to allow human economic activity to happen at all. When a farmer buys seed and a tractor and works his tuchus off cultivating and harvesting his crops, that's all Secondary Economy work. The fact that plants evolved little starch pods called grain, that the microbes in the soil allow plants to grow in it, that bees pollinate the plants, and that the sun shines down free energy for photosynthesis is all the Primary Economy. Lastly, we have the <i>Tertiary Economy</i>, which is the economy of financial instruments like money, loans, and stocks. Theoretically, everything in the Tertiary Economy is a representation of something in the Primary or Secondary Economy: I have a piece of paper called a "Title" that says I own a chunk of land, but the bank has a piece of paper saying they get the land if I don't pay back the loan they gave me to buy the title, and so on. So long as the Tertiary Economy remains pretty lightly linked with the Primary and Secondary economies, it's incredibly useful - using money to settle transactions and measure wealth has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">lots of benefits</a>, and other financial instruments help to start bigger, more complex businesses that can be valuable to everybody. Unfortunately, the Tertiary Economy has a tendency to become unmoored from underlying economic reality and to eat up more and more of the total share of economic activity in the form of speculative bubbles. The more emphasis on the Tertiary Economy, the more bubbles like this happen. Our current economy is something like 75% in the Tertiary by notional dollar value, which is definitely something to think about.

<h4 id="org8c690b1">Work Out Your Relationship to Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c690b1">
<p>
This is the bit of this post I had the hardest time writing. It's big, weighty, and feelings run very strong around it. So I'll just try to dive in. At one time or another, all of us grapple with questions like "what's the point of all this?" or "how do I know what to really care about?" Some of us find answers that work for us in the teachings of a religion or a philosophy. Others of us look to what science and reason can tell us. And some of us try to bring our eyes down to the here and now and focus on what's right in front of us and set aside such big, maybe unanswerable questions. Perhaps the most common response is to distract ourselves from the questions so that we don't have to think about them. Television, booze, sex, jobs, gadgets, jewelry - whatever our own vice might be, we find something that lets us ignore those questions for a while. This is a bad long-term strategy, for at some point, <i>something</i> will happen that will show you the distractions for what they are - empty, meaningless, a waste of your precious time and attention. Sometimes this can hit like a ton of bricks: maybe someone you love dies, or maybe the relationship you've built your life around ends, or you find out you've only got a few months to live. If you wait for these heavy moments to think seriously about meaning, you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">gonna have a bad time</a>. Instead, start now. I won't tell you what traditions to explore, and I certainly won't tell you what conclusions to come to. This kind of thing is irreducibly personal, and what works for me is unlikely to work for you. If you're at a loss on where to start, there's an online book called <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> that I think does a pretty good job of outlining many of the reasons this is a thorny problem, approaches that have historically been tried and some of the problems with them, and so forth. You could also do worse than to read some ancient philosophy. If there's a religious tradition that's familiar or appeals to you, you might see what it has to offer. Wherever you start, don't expect this to be a quick project, something you sort out over the summer and never think about again. Wrestling with meaning is a life-long challenge, but one that can make everything else far more worthwhile.

<h4 id="orgf5a53c3">Meditate Discursively</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf5a53c3">
<p>
Lots of folks these days take seriously the idea of taking a bit of time every day to get your mind right, which is great. On the other hand, almost all of them practice forms of "mind-emptying" techniques that seek to still conscious thought, which is a bit less great. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with such techniques in and of themselves, but they have some little talked-about downsides. First off, very many folks find them tough to get started with or keep up. Secondly, even for folks who make a habit of it, many don't get that much out of them. Thirdly, and most seriously, a small number of people have very strong negative psychological reactions (most often if they jump straight into something like a week-long silent retreat with no prior training). Luckily, there's another method of meditation called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/68294.html">"Discursive Meditation"</a>, which I learned from John Michael Greer. This method has a long history, tremendous benefits, and pretty much perfect safety.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to do it: sit up straight in a chair, breathe deeply, and spend several minutes thinking about a specific theme of spiritual/philosophical significance. That's it! If you'd like more detail, check out the link above for a series of posts that lay it out step by step. You get all the good of training your attention not to wander, breathing deeply, and paying attention to your posture, while also giving your thinking mind a good workout as well. I've tried a wide variety of <a href="https://courses.liveanddare.com/limitless-life-meditation">meditation techniques</a>, and this one has been by far the most rewarding for me. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but think over giving it a shot. It's easy, safe, and works equally well whatever your spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) may be.

Given the expectations and norms of our current culture, this one might be most useful for heterosexual males, but I hope it's helpful to whoever might need it. Many young folks, when they find themselves romantically interested in someone take an approach of "let's get to be friends, and then I'll ask her/him out later". This sounds reasonable, but is actually a terrible plan born of cowardice. Yes, I know, harsh, but that harshness comes from my own bitter experience of trying to follow this plan back in the day. Basically, asking someone out is scary, and we scramble to  mitigate that fear any way we can. It seems like asking someone out will be less scary if we know the other person already likes us as a friend. Plausible, but crap. Being friends is not the same as being lovers, they're different relationships with different dynamics and different needs. Of course, there is <i>some</i> overlap, but it's actually easier to go from "we went on a date and there wasn't any chemistry" to "so let's just be friends" than it is to go from "we feel comfortable together as friends" to "so do you want to risk ruining that with awkwardness by going on a date?" So, if there's someone you think you might want to date, ask them out instead of trying to be friends first.

<h4 id="orgdac664b">Have Kids If You Want Them</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdac664b">
<p>
So yes, kids aren't for everyone, and you definitely shouldn't have a kid if you aren't ready or don't really want one, but overall, kids are pretty great. I wanted to state this explicitly, because from the outside, it's easy to see what sucks about having kids: they take your time, they're expensive, they throw fits, they cover you in snot and get you sick, and so on. The thing is, from the outside, it's also harder to see what is great about having kids: watching a human gradually come online, seeing your own facial expressions mirrored back to you, having someone who feels emotions more intensely than you even know how to run up, throw their arms around you, and bury their face in your shoulder. There is absolutely nothing like it.

<h4 id="org7462fe6">Learn from the Stoics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7462fe6">
<p>
There's a lot of great stuff in ancient philosophy, but if I had to pick one thing that's most helpful, it would be the core insight of Stoicism: "you can't control what happens to you, but you <i>can</i> control how you react to it". Simple to state, hard to live. Someone cuts you off in traffic? You didn't make that happen, but you have full control over whether you get mad, how mad you get, and what you do because you're mad. Again, I know, easier said that done. And the Stoics acknowledged that you might not be able to stop that initial flare of anger from appearing, but <i>you are not your emotions</i>. They are something that happen to you, and you can choose to engage with them or distance yourself from them. Sometimes anger is useful, because it motivates you to right wrongs. Other times it just stresses you out for no reason. Learning to get inside your own cognitive processes like this is enormously helpful. Instead of being jerked around by whatever emotion happens to flare up due to circumstances, you can decide to steer your life based on whatever values you find truly important.

<h4 id="org93ede19">Turn Off Notifications, Feeds, and News</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org93ede19">
<p>
Most folks say that time is your most valuable resource, but I'd tweak that to say that <i>attention</i> is your most valuable resource. We've all had hours or days or weeks where we didn't do much and felt vaguely crappy afterwards. We've also all had experiences of intense, focused attention, maybe only for a few minutes, that have stuck with us as peak moments. Time may be the quantitative measure of your finitude in this existence, but attention is the qualitative. Where I'm going with all this high-flying philosophy is that you should be utterly ruthless in guarding your attention from anyone and anything that tries to grab it without your express, willed intent. Ever had a pleasant evening spoiled when you got an text from someone wanting you to deal with some problem for them? Ever been right in the middle of straightening out a complicated argument in your head when an email alert has popped up and you lose that almost-there insight? Ever been at dinner with a date, you're really getting into the conversation, and then they check their phone? Notifications destroy the quality of whatever they interrupt, even if you don't do anything else with them right away. It's even worse when the notifications try to further hijack your attention - taking you to a social media post that is at the top of a rabbit hole you go down for hours or to a news story that freaks you out and ruins your mood for a whole weekend. Notifications are evil. Turn as many of them off as you can possibly get away with. Put your attention where <i>you</i> want it to go, and keep it there for as long as <i>you</i> decide.

<h4 id="org3403aea">Spend Some Time Outside</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3403aea">
<p>
This one really is this simple: every day if you can, but at least once a week, go spend some time sitting or walking outdoors. If you can get somewhere with plants and animals, go there. If not, consider moving somewhere less hellish, but in the meantime, sun or moon and sky will do just fine. Most of us spend most of our lives in large boxes looking at smaller, brighter boxes, focusing on an abstract world of words, images, and thoughts. As such, we have very little connection to the actual, physical world that keeps us alive. So, go outside. This shouldn't be some doleful chore (though, on some days in the summer in Texas, it can feel that way). Go feel the warm sun on your face, watch squirrels get frisky, check out good-looking guys or gals. Fifteen or twenty minutes is great if you can get it, but even just a handful of minutes can do wonders.

<h4 id="org6d04776">Don't "Follow Your Passion"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d04776">
<p>
This is the core idea in Cal Newport's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love-9781455509126/9781455509126">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. "Follow your passion" was a rallying cry for Baby Boomers who had followed the overly-conservative career advice of parents who lived through the Great Depression, and it was useful for getting folks used to the idea that maybe you shouldn't be miserable at your job if you can help it. Unfortunately, it was going too far to suggest that everyone has some deep, inborn passion that they just need to discover and their whole life will fall into place. Sure, some folks have these life-defining passions, but most of them figure that out pretty young. You ever met someone who can't help but draw, no matter what? That guy's got a passion, he doesn't need the advice to find it. Most of us don't have that. Instead, most of us <i>become</i> passionate about whatever we get <i>good at</i>. So, Newport recommends you find some skills that are both rare and valuable and then get good at them. Rare so that you're not a dime a dozen, and valuable so that other people will actually pay for it. Some examples: crafting ships in bottles is rare, but not so valuable. Being a decent, but not great, computer programmer is fairly valuable, but not that rare. So, if you want a challenging, meaningful career, find something hard to get good at that's in demand, and then get good at that. Once you do, you'll have more control over what you do, who you work for, and what you achieve.

<h4 id="org092d865">Learn a Craft</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org092d865">
<p>
Learn how to make something with your hands - scarves, bread, motorcycle engines, whatever grabs you. If you don't know what you might like making, try a wide variety of crafts (remember Divergence and Convergence?). Pay attention to what seems interesting even when you're not good at it (for me, that's woodcarving). Then take some classes, watch some videos, find a club, or whatever works - learn the skills you need and then make the time to do it. Getting really good might take a lot of work, but you can get to "just fine" in many things with very little practice: for example, I bet you could go from "bread comes from a shelf in the store" to baking tasty loaves in 2 or 3 tries, tops. The goal here is not to become an artisan and quit your job to do glassblowing full time (though, if you can make that work, more power to you). The point is to concentrate deeply and engage with something outside of yourself in the real world. You'll find there's a big difference between imagining what it takes to turn water, flour, and yeast into dough versus feeling a sticky substance and smooshing it around until it feels right. Not only is it helpful to ground yourself like this, it is <i>hugely</i> enjoyable! If you've never "lost yourself" in something you cared about, then you are truly missing out. Of the most meaningful things in my life, almost all of them involved this kind of focused attention.

<h4 id="orgf7af6ae">Make the Right Thing Easier</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf7af6ae">
<p>
I learned this from the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-house-that-cleans-itself/9780736949873">The House that Cleans Itself</a>  by Mindy Starns Clark. If you have tried something multiple times with the best of intentions, but for some reason it won't stick,  "I'll do it again, but this time I'll just try harder" is most likely a losing strategy. Instead, find a way to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, mail used to pile up on the credenza by the door. So, my wife and I put a two-drawer inbox on the credenza and a recycling bin next to it. Now, it's easy to sort what's mine or hers, and any junk mail goes right in the recycling. Apparently, it was too hard to walk the 15 feet to the main recycling bin, but it's not too hard to drop it within arm's reach. Go figure. Seriously, sometimes the tweaks that make something doable will be downright embarrassing. You can apply this concept in lots of areas of your life: set up automatic savings, don't have junk food in the house, put your alarm where you have to get out of bed to turn it off, have charging cables everywhere you might need to charge your phone, and so forth. There <i>are</i> some things where the answer is training your willpower, but more often than you might think, you can find a way to make it easier to win.

<h4 id="orgcfc584b">Fake It Till You Make It</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfc584b">
<p>
This advice has become much more widespread of late, but allow me to reiterate: you will not be good at something when you start. You get good at it by doing it. Humans are imitative animals, so if you want to be good at something, act as much like someone who is good at it as you can, and then keep at it. Eventually, the act will become the reality (likely far before you believe it). Don't put anybody at risk, of course, but it is almost always much safer to risk failing than you're afraid it is.

<h4 id="orge446567">Drink Water</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge446567">
<p>
If you're anything like me, you might have grown up drinking too much other liquid (like Dr. Pepper) and not enough water. Luckily, the Army beat this out of me, so I now take hydration very seriously. If you don't drink much water, you will be <i>shocked</i> at how much better you feel if you get enough. Here's how to do it: buy a 1 quart bottle that you will find convenient to carry around pretty much everywhere. Set a goal of drinking 2 of these a day (more if you do something that makes you sweat much). Set specific times/events by which to empty the bottle - for example "I'll drink one by lunch time and the next one by the end of the work day". If you find yourself getting light-headed, add a <i>tiny</i> pinch of salt to one or both bottles. If you are thirsty, add a 3rd or 4th bottle. If you drink any alcohol, consider going for that 3rd or 4th bottle just in case, and make sure you get some salt either in food or added to your water. Seriously, if you haven't been getting enough water, you have no idea how much it helps: headaches, tiredness, muscle growth, weight loss - all better with water.

<h4 id="orgbaf987e">Stretch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbaf987e">
<p>
Most of us far more time sitting than our bodies are built for (see the point about How to Stand/Sit), which leaves us stiff. So get some stretching in your life. You can experiment, but here are a few good options to try out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AakYeM23sI">Sun Salutations</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_bY6REpIPE">Five Rites</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHnN0pBKM4n4x7wI90zg-Od0hSOKawwJ">Daily Dozen</a> , <a href="https://coursetolife.com/courses/gymnasticbodies-fundamentals-f1-pro-bundle/">Gymnastic Strength Training Daily Limber</a>. Whatever you pick, pay special attention to your back, since that's where a lot of the bad effects of sitting show up, but it's all linked up, so find a whole body routine. If you have a more intensive stretching practice, like Yoga or Gymnastic training or the like, then that's awesome, but even if you are otherwise a couch potato, do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes stretching every day.

<h4 id="orgb5dde42">Stand (and Sit) Well</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb5dde42">
<p>
Okay, this one is best done by demonstration, but it's important enough that I didn't want to leave it out here. As folks who spend far too much time sitting, we are all bad at standing, which paradoxically also makes us bad at sitting. We stand and sit in ways that damage our skeletons and circulatory systems, so it'd be great to fix that. If you want to go <i>real</i> deep, check out <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deskbound-1-standing-up-to-a-sitting-world/9781628600582">Deskbound: Standing Up to a Sitting World</a> by Dr. Kelly Starrett, which is where I got this checklist for proper standing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Feet</i>: Plant your feet, toes straight forward (not out to the side or pointed inward) about hip-width apart.</li>
<li><i>Knees</i>: Very slightly tense your muscles as if trying to turn your toes outward while keeping your heels planted, but don't let your toes actually move. You should feel this as a slight tension in your knees, which this movement stabilizes.</li>
<li><i>Hips</i>: Tense your butt cheeks to do a humping motion with your hips, moving your tail bone down and forward. For a less crude metaphor, imagine that your hips are a cup and that you don't want to pour any liquid out the front. This stabilizes your hips.</li>
<li><i>Lower Back</i>: Gently tense your abs, about 1/3 of full tension, pulling them back toward your spine</li>
<li><i>Upper Back</i>: Rotate your arms in your shoulder sockets. To do this, with your hands at your sides, rotate them until your thumbs face forward.</li>
<li><i>Head</i>: Move your head a bit forward and backward and feel for the spot where it's sitting right on top of the stable pillar you just made from the ground up.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations, you are now standing the way your body was designed for! Keeping your body in this position every waking hour is a bit much, but I use this process as a handy check-in to "reset" when I notice myself slouching.
</p>

<p>
To sit, just do steps 4-6, but you'll notice it's much harder. Your legs, and especially your hips, are doing a lot of the work of maintaining good posture when you stand, and when you sit, you basically don't have them to help.

My name is Jeff Russell. This webstead is my home on the internet. I plan to share my thoughts on the many things I'm interested in. Hopefully you'll find them interesting too.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've had somewhat sundered "selves" on the web - I had a blog and social media account for gaming, another blog and webstead for coaching and thoughts on business and getting more work done and such, and I've lurked around reading but not putting out there my interests in things like philosophy, magic, and religion. After listening to Naval Ravikant <a href="https://nav.al/rich">talk about</a> why you want to welcome and make the most out of what you have that no one else does, and to Josh Waitzkin <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/06/19/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-distilled/">talk about</a> how greatness comes from "embracing your funk", I made up my mind to set that right - hence, here we are, with one stead to put all of those many interests.

This webstead is largely built following the advice in <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed to Last</a> by Jeff Huang. That's why almost everything is on one page, the formatting is minimal, and the html/css is as simple and vanilla as I can make it.
