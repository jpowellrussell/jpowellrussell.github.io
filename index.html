We've made it! I know I've harped a bit much about the length of this book and how it's been a slog at times, but in my defense, I started reading this book in July of last year, so that's about half a year of working my way through this book. All of which is to say, I'm glad to have made it through. I'll write up the last chapter and Epilogue here, and I'm thinking about doing one more post with overall thoughts on the book as a kind of capstone to the series. Let's take a look at how Kvilhaug closes out her book.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeb08ebb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgeb08ebb">At Last, a Clear Meaning for "Pantheism"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb08ebb">
<p>
All throughout the book, Kvilhaug has been talked about "pantheism," but she's been a bit murky about what she exactly means by that, which has been frustrating, because "pantheism" comes in a lot of unalike flavors that can have some very different theological implications. At last, here at the end, though, Kvilhaug lays out what she means:
</p>

<blockquote>
Pantheism is a concept that may be understood in different ways, so to clarify what I mean by the term. It is basically the idea that one unifying deity or universal soul lays at the core of all deities, a one within the many, or a many within the one. The concept also includes divine immanence, the idea that the divine unity is immanent in "creation," "nature," or "the universe," not outside of and apart from it. In many Pantheist traditions, the divine is the soul of existence itself, as a whole, and thus we are all aspects of the ultimate divine soul.
</blockquote>
- Kvilhaug, M. (2020). p. 551

<p>
In the rest of the chapter, she expands further on this. Though she says that she acknowledges the reality of difference between different people and different Gods, it becomes pretty clear that she thinks it's <i>more</i> true in some important sense that we are parts of "the same thing," the universal soul/Godhead/pantheistic root stuff. This has a few implications, some of which we'll talk about in a tick, but maybe the biggest one is that she believes any and every path to contemplation of or searching for the divine will end up leading to the same place, and some paths seem to be more direct routes than others, so if you figure all this out, you can skip tedious steps like worshiping the Gods as separate beings rather than as particular manifestations of something you already have within yourself. As early on in the book, Kvilhaug again gives some lip service to the idea that different religious approaches are all valid, but manages to give off the impression that anyone who doesn't take her approach is less sophisticated or hasn't gotten as close to the truth, so that's fun. To be clear, I don't think Kvilhaug's beliefs or approach are untenable or preposterous, I just think that her certainty that her way is the right way is kind of annoying.

<h3 id="org0f18245">More On Mystery Cults</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f18245">
<p>
Kvilhaug gets back into the idea of Germanish "mystery cults" like those known from the classical world and goes further with the idea than when she talked about it before. One of the main jumping off points she uses for her discussion is a curious remark by Tacitus: he says that the Suebi, one of the Germanish confederations of tribes around in his time (1st century CE), worship "Isis." Kvilhaug does a pretty good job of talking about the various things this might mean, assuming he's not just wrong, which seems unlikely for an otherwise rather credible observer. First, she goes through the likelihood that some of the Germans back then <i>literally</i> worshiped an Egyptian Goddess. This is not as crazy a possibility as it might at first glance seem: by the 1st century CE, a mystery cult devoted to the Hellenistic version of Isis was one of the most popular forms of religious devotion in the Roman Empire. Even at this early date, the Germans must have had plenty of cultural contact with the Romans - it wasn't all cattle raids and obliterated legions - so, some of them might have picked up some religious practices from their more civilized neighbors to the south.
</p>

<p>
Though not implausible, Kvilhaug asserts, and I agree, that it is even more likely that when Tacitus said "Isis," he very likely meant a Goddess that seemed enough like what an educated Roman knew about Isis that he figured the Goddess the Germans were worshiping was the same one. This was, in fact, the norm for Roman writers: to use the familiar name of a Roman God or Goddess for whichever of the local Gods or Goddesses seemed most alike: for example, it seems very likely that when the Romans talked about German worship of "Mercury," they meant an earlier version of Odhinn, most likely because they heard something like "he is the God of poetry, speaking well, and magic, and he travels around a lot" and thought "sounds like Mercury to us." Kvilhaug goes on to argue that Tacitus's choice of <i>Isis</i> rather than, say, Juno or Venus or Minerva, or another more homegrown Roman Goddess, is an indirect indicator that the Goddess worshiped by the Germans was a "Great Goddess" (more on that in the next bit), or at least a Goddess with many areas of influence, including sovereignty of some kind. She also finds it significant that Tacitus chose the Goddess worshiped in a mystery cult - one reason he might have picked her is that he recognized something in the worship of the Suebi that looked like a mystery cult.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug goes on to argue that the famous cult center at Uppsala might have functioned as the site of mystery initiations like Eluesis in Greece. I don't think the case is decisive, but it is certainly an intriguing possibility. We know that Uppsala was famous throughout the Old Norse world and drew worshipers from all over, much as Eleusis was and did in the Mediterranean. We know that Uppsala was richly endowed with gold and other ornaments, as was Eleusis. Uppsala held a regular festival (every nine years) as did Eluesis (yearly). There's even a hint in Saxo Grammaticus that there was some kind of stage performance at Uppsala, and Eleusis likely staged plays as part of the Lesser Mysteries. There are also some interesting mythological parallels between some of the tales of the Gods we know to have been worshiped at Uppsala (Odhinn, Freyr, and Thorr) and some of the mystery cults we know about from the classical world, but those were a bigger focus in the earlier section of the book.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I think Kvilhaug makes some interesting points here, and perhaps offers some avenues for further exploration. I'm not quite as <i>sure</i> that there was a "Mystery Cult" of the Nordic world in heathen times as it seems Kvilhaug is, but that may be a bit of playing around with definitions. I think it is nearly beyond doubt that there existed <i>some</i> kind of esoteric religious practice, very likely including some kind of initiation, during most, or more likely all, of heathen times. If <i>nothing</i> else, it seems very likely that religious specialists of various kinds, like the <i>volur</i>, must have had some kind of practice, training, and initiation to become recognized in their roles. It would also be consistent with what we know of other polytheistic religions for their to be some amount of more involved practice or special rituals for more enthusiastic members of the laity (such as the mysteries that are the main topic of this section, but also things like pilgrimages to significant shrines for purification in Shinto or meditative and prayer practices in Buddhism). Should we consider such initiatory and/or esoteric practices "mystery cults?" That's harder to say. To me, that implies a level of regularity, continuity, and organization that it's a lot harder to prove, especially for a <i>mystery</i> cult. So, I'm not saying Kvilhaug is <i>wrong</i> that there was an Old Norse mystery school of some sort, just that I'm less confident than she is that it's a slam dunk.

<h3 id="orge4c74d2">The Great Goddess (or God)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge4c74d2">
<p>
Earlier in the book, Kvilhaug talked about Freyja as a "Great Goddess," a theory put forth by some scholars (some that she named: Britt Mari Nasstrom, Folke Strom, and Anne Holtsmark). Basically, the theory goes that in some religions, and most especially in those of a pantheistic bent, you tend to see one deity revered as the best representation of the universal immanent soul/divinity/godhead, and that often that deity is a Goddess. Further, in the Nordic countries, that Goddess was Freyja, and all of the other Goddesses are just hypostases or other aspects of Her. Here, Kvilhaug revisits this argument, but takes it a bit farther given the explicit pantheism that is the focus of this chapter. She says that if all Gods and Goddesses are just manifestations of the same universal soul, then <i>of course</i> all Goddesses are one Goddesses, but also, they're all one God, depending on the myth. She further elaborates on the point she has made before that Heimdallr is the "Great World," or the embodiment of all of the cosmos, and in some of His myths serves as the universal divine that all other Gods (And Goddesses and Men and Women and everything else) are just emanations of. Odhinn also seems to sometimes fill the role of "all divinity present in all things." I think mostly you'll be nodding along with this if you buy Kvilhaug's assertions about pantheism, and you'll find it speculative or hand-wavey or otherwise useless if you don't.

<h3 id="orgab97914">Eagles: An Unlooked-For Comparison</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab97914">
<p>
Okay, this far into the book, I've gotten used to some pretty out-there comparisons and tie-ins and the like: dwarves as space aliens, Thorr as the literal magnetosphere, Cybele and Ishtar as influences on Norse Goddesses, but I was still <i>not</i> expecting to see the Norse myths compared to Carlos Castaneda <i>at all</i>. If you're not familiar, Castaneda wrote a series of books while studying for his anthropology Ph.D. that became rather popular. In these, he describes learning about spiritual matters from a Yaqui (a Mexican Indian tribe) "man of knowledge" named don Juan Matus. Apparently, in one of these books, <i>The Fire from Within</i>, Castaneda tells about don Juan describing the visions of the "Old Toltec seers" involving a huge spiritual force/entity that is "like an eagle" that is the source of all consciousness, and from which "streams" or "emanations" of force or awareness flow, but which also eats the awareness of souls when they die, enhancing it's own knowledge and consciousness through the experience thus consumed. Kvilhaug compares this with the prominent role played by eagles and Gods/jotnar in eagle shape in the Norse myths, especially <i>Hraesvelgr</i>, "Corpse Swallower," the eagle who sits at the top of the World Tree, from whose flapping wings come all winds, and who eats the dead (and might be the same as Thjazi and/or Suttung). I'm not gonna lie: the parallels are at least interesting, if not downright striking, not least because they seem to come from such disparate sources.
</p>

<p>
There's something to know when considering this comparison, though. After Castaneda's books became very popular, some folks came out expressing doubts that his accounts were accurate, or even that don Juan was a real person. The works feature very little that is verifiably Yaqui in language or culture, there's no outside corroboration of don Juan or Castaneda's interactions with him, and there are certain inconsistencies in the stories as given that would be odd for careful ethnographic work. All of which is to say that some folks think Castaneda's a stone-cold fake. <a href="https://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a>, whom I respect greatly on all matters occult and esoteric, agrees that Castaneda's works are likely best thought of as fiction, but fiction that nevertheless includes some very deep spiritual insights. If such allegations are true, or close to true, it also renders the "proof" of Old Norse and indigenous Mexican beliefs describing similar spiritual realities far less impressive. Even still, I've never encountered any mention of Castaneda having any familiarity with Norse myth, so it'd be pretty strange if he had consciously incorporated anything from it as part of making something up. If Kvilhaug is wrong that these are truly uncrossed parallel visions of a deeper spiritual reality, the most likely explanation to me is that Castaneda was exposed to enough "adjacent" cultural material to Old Norse myth that a vision he had himself featured an eagle in a similar role. But it's also possible that she's onto something here, and it certainly makes for great food for bethinking.

<h3 id="org5bd4bab">The Norse Myths are Intentional, Symbolic Fiction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5bd4bab">
<p>
I mentioned above that Kvilhaug's belief that the pantheistic truth of the universe can be approached multiple ways has further implications in the chapter, and the biggest one might be that she sees the myths as <i>merely</i> metaphorical expressions of the ineffable truth of pantheism. Specifically, she believes that the poems of the Edda were works of "fiction" crafted by their writers with conscious metaphorical intent. In other words, she thinks the Eddic poems bear a similar relationship to pantheistic truth as <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> bears to the gospel. She sees the Eddic and Skaldic poets as initiates into the pantheist-flavored mysteries she discusses who used the raw material of their culture's folkways and lore to consciously try to convey the deep truths they had experienced in metaphorical language. On the one hand, this helps make sense of Kvilhaug's tendency to equate darn-near everything (more on that in the next bit) - she feels like they're all just intentionally chosen symbols anyway, so it doesn't much matter which one is used, except as it is affected by things like poetic, narrative, or aesthetic considerations. Since all religious insights end up pointing to the same end eventually, it's helpful to compare notes between two different paths to triangulate where it seems they're both pointing to. Hell, this interpretative framework being asserted is even consistent with Kvilhaug's pantheistic chauvinism - if the pantheistic unity of all spiritual insights is true, and if these poets were folks who had deeply grasped this, what else <i>could</i> they write besides conscious metaphors of ineffable truths?
</p>

<p>
My main beef here is that this isn't really how myths work, and Kvilhaug has shown a lot of the evidence that they don't throughout this book. Multiple times, she gives examples of the surprising longevity of mythic themes and figures - the Bronze Age carvings showing a sun Goddess and what looks like a God with a hammer, Tacitus's account of a Goddess of plenty paraded in a cart, just like Frey's statue in late heathen times, and others. One of the reasons myths are so long-lasting is because they are <i>important</i> to their culture: there's a right way to tell one and a wrong way. Different storytellers might try out different variations, but only within certain bounds. You might be able to get away with changing <i>how</i> Thor killed a particular jotun, but if you said He <i>didn't</i>, or that He was a coward, or a pacifist, everyone would just say "that's not how the story goes!" My point is that within a culture where myths are still a vital part of its religious life, and not just one piece of cultural heritage among others, the elements of those myths are not simple raw materials that can be repurposed to whatever end an individual author wants.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, I don't think Kvilhaug is saying that the skalds were picking Gods or Goddesses willy-nilly, with no regard for what They were known to be like. I think, instead, that she was saying the old stories had always had hints of the pantheism she believes the skalds wanted to convey, and those skalds picked stories and emphasized elements from them that highlighted those hints. Sure, at times in the ancient world, we had self-conscious works using mythological elements like Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, or more earnest, but still clearly very intentional, works like <i>The Golden Ass</i> by Apuleius, but these came in societies at a very different place in their development than the Iron Age and early Medieval Nordic countries. Even if Kvilhaug is right that there were explicit mystery cults in the north back then, I am skeptical that their adherents would be crafting explicitly allegorical works out of the raw material of organic myths.

<h3 id="org6ac8b9c">Everything is the Same as Everything Else</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6ac8b9c">
<p>
It is maybe fitting that once Kvilhaug (finally) reveals the full shape of her interpretative framework of the myths she makes it clearer than ever before why she has been so ready to find similarities between different Gods, Goddesses, jotnar, stories, places, and things: she <i>literally</i> believes they are all "really" the same thing. Urdhr is Brynhild is Idhunn is Frigg is Freyja is Odhinn is Heimdall is Ymir is Mimir is Thjazi is&#x2026; You get the idea. And no, I'm not exaggerating for comedic effect here. When making the comparison between different eagle myths we talked about above, she goes on to say that the myth of an eagle that is the source of all winds and is the "corpse devourer" is <i>the same</i> myth as the roaring mill (<i>Hvergelmir</i>) in the underworld that receives all souls but is also the source of all streams. And both of those are the same as <i>Urdharbrunnar</i>, the Well of Origin/Fate. If Freyja is the "Great Goddess" that is the "true" nature behind the many masks of the other Goddesses, Norns, Valkyries, and others, well, then, Odhinn the Great God is <i>the same thing</i>, only seen for its masculine attributes rather than feminine. Since all of these figures are just symbols pointing at one, single thing behind them, any differences are wholly arbitrary, or at best, aesthetic or contingent on what aspect of that single thing the storyteller wants to emphasize today, in this one story. I have to give Kvilhaug credit for being consistent on this matter, and following the implications of her beliefs through to their logical conclusions, but if you don't share her starting premise, it's a frustrating experience to see the rich and exciting world of manifold Gods, Goddesses, elves, dwarves, jotnar, trolls, and so forth all thrown into a blender and turned into homogeneous slop.
</p>

<p>
The systems of spiritual teaching I am currently exploring teach that, yes, all of reality is a manifestation of a single source, and so, in some sense, we are all made of the same "stuff" and are parts of the same "whole," as Kvilhaug asserts. The systems I follow, though, lay far more emphasis than Kvilhaug seems to on how different manifestations truly do differ in meaningful ways. You and I and Odhinn may all be emanations of "the One," but to say that it is "more true" or "more important" that we are "the same" than that we are "different" seems reductive to the point that it might as well be false. Now, might it be an important part of spiritual insight and growth to see that we are "the same" in ways that are not immediately obvious? Quite possibly, yes! But to take that and say "therefore, differences are an unimportant illusion that can be dispensed with" strikes me as springing from a desire to make a big, complicated world easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
Look at how utterly confusing and messy the natural world is. On the one hand, you could just say "well, all of life is just an assortment of arrangements of carbon atoms with a few others brought along." Okay, sure, technically right, I guess, but hell, look at how utterly messy and confusing those arrangements of carbon are. Look at <i>just your own gut</i> - we have such a poor understanding of how digestion works, how it interacts with everything else going on in our body, how it interacts with the billions of other critters that live inside our body, and so forth. That's one piece of the natural world that is <i>right here</i>! We haven't even touched the fungal and microbial ecosystems in the soil under forests. Or the undiscovered species of insects in the rainforests. Or what the hell is going on at the vents at the bottom of the ocean. If the world that is available to our bodily senses is made out of such fractal complexity, why would we expect the world beyond those senses, which is supposed to be inhabited by beings greater, smarter, and far older than us, to be any simpler? Or for attractive simplifying assumptions like "they're all <i>really</i> just emanations of the same universal soul" to be any more helpful than "those are all <i>really</i> just arrangements of carbon atoms"?
</p>

<p>
Maybe I'll change my mind on this as I go further in my spiritual exploration, but for now, I am deeply suspicious of any metaphysical scheme that tries to wrap things up in a nice, neat, easy-for-humans-to-understand package. We're clever apes with moderately developed sparks of something divine within us, and there's a whole lot more of Being than there is of us.

<h3 id="org2003576">Not Really a Mystery, and Not Really a Thesis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2003576">
<p>
Given that in other parts of the book, Kvilhaug has talked about how working out the deeper meanings of the myths is like a detective story, I think one reason she might have held off until the last chapter to lay her metaphysical/theological cards on the table was to "make her case." Now, there's a place for narrative non-fiction, where the thing being explored <i>is</i> treated kind of like a mystery that is gradually uncovered chapter by chapter as new evidence is brought in and the implications are gradually, tantalizingly made clear. From what I remember about reading <i>Fingerprints of the Gods</i> back in college, it did an <i>excellent</i> job of this, hinting and teasing at the final "reveal" while making its case, but not entirely giving the game away until the end. If something like that is what Kvilhaug was going for, well, the poor organization I've lamented in almost all of these reviews has betrayed her, because she spoiled herself throughout the whole book, repeatedly. I think the book would have been much stronger if she had just come out at the beginning and said "I think the Old Norse myths are works of metaphorical literature intentionally crafted to convey the pantheistic spiritual insights of a mystery religion similar to those found in the classical world and elsewhere, I'll spend the rest of the book proving it." Which is, you know, the standard approach in academic writing, which you might expect someone who holds a Masters degree to gravitate toward. Finally having her put these things so explicitly made a lot of the rest of the book click into place more clearly. Maybe it wouldn't have done so without reading the rest of the book, I dunno - if you happen to read all of these reviews before reading the book and decide to start with the last chapter and then read the rest, please let me know how that works out.
</p>

<p>
For me, this is a much stronger criticism than "it's a bit repetitive at times" or "wow, I wish you had gone to the trouble to make an index" or even "you scatter important insights about the same topic across multiple chapters."  All of those are structural issues, but this is a <i>foundational</i> issue - the rest of the structure is built on shaky groundwork, so no wonder it's harder to follow than it ought to be. Kvilhaug ends the book with a description of another personal spiritual experience (and again, it's pretty well done for that kind of thing), one that granted her a key insight into the pantheism she has come to believe is at the core of Norse Myth, and together with the Epilogue, it seems clear that she thinks this provides a nice, inspirational send-off, encouraging the reader to begin his own exploration of the pantheistic truth hidden within the myths, with her insights as his guide. Instead, it just felt like another idiosyncratic take consistent with what has been said over-and-over throughout the book, but never all that clearly, and presented as the authoritative truth, despite some token protestations of intellectual humility. It was a somewhat disappointing, but not all that surprising, ending to a very uneven book - genuinely worthwhile insights mired in a confused, repetitive structure, and crammed into one true framework of interpretation.

I took a bit of a break from <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_1_introduction_and_the_books_of_old">The Seed of Yggdrasill</a> to read a book that I
thought might help me with my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> project: <i>Spellcraft</i> by Robin
Skelton. It's not a particularly long book, and it's one of the few books on any
sort of magic written by someone who was also a talented (and published) poet
and student of poetry (his <i>The Shapes of Our Singing</i> is a far more conventional
book of poetics that explains a number of different traditional poetic
structures drawn from cultures and languages around the world). The book was
recommended to me by <a href="https://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> when I asked whether crafting magical
intentions and/or affirmations as poems made them more effective, and if so, if
he had any recommendations on the subject.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that Skelton might take <i>slight</i> issue with the use JMG recommended
and that I turned to the book for - in it, he argues that while "spells" (more
on what he means by that in a moment) <i>can</i> be poetic, if you get too caught up in
crafting a poem, you're actually doing something different than making a <i>spell</i>.
So, what does he mean by a spell, then? For Skelton, a spell is a spoken
utterance of words meant to bring about a desired intent. He distinguishes
spells from other types of magic, which might rely on ritual (ceremonial magic),
specific herbs or stones (natural magic), or symbolic association of the target
or intent with items or actions meant to represent them (sympathetic magic).
Throughout the book, he touches on these other kinds of magic, because in
practice, all of these have almost always blended together and supported one
another, but he always focuses on the spoken formulae and their characteristics.
</p>

<p>
Since he was a professional crafter of words, this focus is both reasonable and
appreciated. It keeps the book pretty tight, and he has insights that someone
focused on the other bits, or trying for a holistic description, might miss. For
example, the way that many spells will try to "pattern" the entire thing being
discussed (whether called upon or being acted on) by sequentially naming enough
specific parts of it to represent it as a whole. A silly example: the children's
song "Head, shoulders, knees, and toes" is clearly meant to represent the whole
body with it's fairly sparse cataloging of body parts from top to bottom. Also,
many spells make use of the "rule of threes," naming the same thing to be done
three times, or naming three things in sequence of increasing significance, or
naming something twice and introducing a variation on the third (like in a
joke). Many of these insights come across as a bit obvious when explained in
plain language, but the value comes in the fact that he inferred these plain
language rules from masses of examples, and then phrased them simply enough to
be easily made use of. A classic example of where the end product looks far
easier than it really was to arrive at.
</p>

<p>
To explain spells, Skelton relies on a more-or-less materialist explanation, but
a distinctly late 70s alternative materialist explanation. If you weren't
familiar, back in the 70s, parapsychology (the study of psychic phenomena) was
still <i>fairly</i> respectable. It was fringe, yes, but professors at big name
universities could get funding to conduct experiments on things like predicting
what card would be drawn, reading the thoughts of a subject, remote viewing, or
telekinesis. The findings were debated, but the belief that psychic phenomena of
some kind or another might be real, and that they likely had some kind of
physical explanation amenable to discovery by scientific experiment was one you
could hold without being banished to the outer darkness. So, <i>Spellcraft</i> asserts
that spells are accomplished by the spellmaker summoning a sufficiently strong
"psychic feeling," and then directing it with focus and a clear intent. By this
explanation, the spell itself (by which I mean the words spoken) is simply a
tool for concentration and communication with the subconscious - likewise with
the other flavors of magic discussed above. This explanatory framework has a few
practical implications. First, it suggests that the spell and any accompanying
ritual, herbs, timing, ceremony, or other considerations are <i>only</i> cues to your
subconscious, and as such, might vary person to person and might be able to be
altered or dispensed with if you can arrive at the proper frame of mind
otherwise. Secondly, it places distinct limits on what you can expect a spell to
accomplish - specifically, whatever can be accomplished through the power of
suggestion (over yourself or someone else, or both). The systems of magic I am
in the process of learning have different explanatory frameworks, and so might
disagree with these implications to a degree, but they also teach that these
implications are <i>mostly</i> right - you might be able to dispense with the ritual or
alter the symbols once you get very good, but there's a reason they are as they
are, and affecting your own consciousness or those of other folks are the most
readily accomplished aims of magic, but maybe not literally the only ones
achievable.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, as for the book itself, Skelton opens with two chapters on over-arching
forms found throughout spells of different intents: invocations and
incantations. An invocation is a pattern for calling up power to be used in the
spell, often from an "outside" power (I use scare quotes because Skelton
expresses agnosticism throughout on the literal external reality of Gods,
spirits, and other non-corporeal beings, and implies that they might simply be
processes and symbols in the deep mind), but not necessarily - an invocation can
be to yourself, an inner quality, or something else. Incantations are a tool for
focusing any power called up through some amount of repetition and enumeration,
often using the "patterning" mentioned above to represent a whole through the
addressing of its most significant parts. As you might guess, very many spells
open with an invocation and then move into an incantation. As Skelton points out
many times, the line between a prayer asking for an outcome and a spell can be
awfully blurry, with the main difference being that an outcome-focused prayer
asks a deity to use His power to make it happen, whereas a spell has the spell
maker at least channeling the power, if not generating it himself. After these
two, he steps through spells by categories of intent: blessing, binding &amp;
bidding, love, and healing. In each, he gives several examples from around the
world (though very many from the Hebrides and Ireland, whether because we have
good documentation there or it was of especial interest to him, I don't know)
and then breaks down what's going on in these examples. I found the combination
of explaining underlying principles and analyzing examples to show those
principles to be very useful. He closes out with a chapter on "Ways and Means"
that I was hoping would be more nitty-gritty language-use advice, but turned out
to have more to do with achieving the proper state of concentration, and so
veered the most into the areas Skelton left out of the book - ritual, timing,
props, and so forth. Again, all of this is treated as ways to get yourself into
the proper headspace, but throughout he does a good job of acknowledging that
what will work well with your deep mind is likely not obvious to your conscious
mind, and you'd do well to err on the side of using traditional symbols and
associations.
</p>

<p>
My chief complaint about the book (besides it not being as literally "how to
write prayers and spells as poetry" as I originally hoped) was that Skelton's
approach to the ethics of magic is not wholly consistent with the approach I
have learned, and I think to its detriment. He's careful to point out that
spells that aim at power and self-aggrandizement and harming others will have
negative effects on the person who casts them, and warns against such things
frequently. He even warns that often, you might <i>think</i> your spell has a pure and
good-hearted intention, but if it's really about fluffing your ego or dominating
others or something, it will not only likely be less effective, it will also be
harmful to you. So, that's appreciated. On the other hand, as the inclusion of a
"Binding &amp; Bidding" chapter might have tipped you off to, he doesn't place that
great a weight on consent, which I've been taught is one of the most important
magical ethical rules. When discussing those spells where consent is lacking
(such as a spell to bid a lover to come to you and make him or herself known),
he's careful to point out that these are the spells most at risk of having
hidden, uglier motives, and that they should be phrased in a way that they are
to the benefit of the other person (for example, don't force a specific person
to burn with inescapable passion for you, but instead invite someone who would
be happy with you to show up and feel well disposed toward you). Reading through
these examples, though, has only made me better appreciate the primacy given to
consent in the systems I'm learning: it's precisely because it's nearly
impossible to self-police your deep-down intentions about highly charged things
that you shouldn't even try it - you should only attempt magic where anyone
directly affected by it is on board with it, as a check that you're not fooling
yourself about what you're trying to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
Overall, though, I enjoyed this book and got some good tips from it, and I look
forward to trying to incorporate them into my practice, even if "spellmaking" as
defined by the book is not the focus of most of what I'm learning (ritual and
ceremony are, instead). It wasn't as directly relevant to my prayer-crafting as
I hoped it would be, but some of the concepts behind invocations and
incantations are helpful for informing how I might structure the more explicitly
poetic prayers I'm trying to put together. Unfortunately, it's been out of print
for a long while, and it looks like it can be tough to come by at a decent price
(cheapest copy on alibris at the time of writing is $97(!), I got it for less
than $30 a little over a year ago), but if you get the chance to check it out,
it's got a lot of interesting thinking on the power of words to speak to and
shape our deep mind for the ends of magic.

This chapter might be one of the best in the book. Not because it has the deepest insights or the newest ways of thinking about the myths - it's all pretty much in line with what she's been saying throughout. Rather, this chapter might suffer the least from the complaints I've had for most of the rest of the book - it's straightforward, not particularly repetitive (while still appropriately referring back to points already discussed), and weaves together evidence from multiple poems into a coherent message. The chapter also has a core point, explores that point, but doesn't wander off on too many tangents, so hooray! Once again, glimpses like this of what this whole book <i>could have been</i>, say if Kvilhaug had hired an editor, are frustrating, but I'll take good stuff where I can get it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8b3045e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8b3045e">The Chapter's Thesis - Thor Stands for the Human Initiate in Eddic Poems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8b3045e">
<p>
Kvilhaug's main point for this chapter is, as I said, pretty straightforward: in (at least most) Eddic poems, Thor stands in as a human initiate being confronted by spiritual challenges. Specifically, Thor stands for a strong, materially successful man, someone on top of the world in this life, who may have less insight into the spiritual world. What's immediately appealing about this theory is that it explains why one of the most respected, widely worshiped Gods of the elder heathens would be shown as such a buffoon in so many of the myths about him. One of the preferred scholarly explanations has never been very satisfying to me, at least not as the whole explanation: Thor was the God of the common man, whereas Odin was the God of poets and lords, so the poetry we have, which was composed by poets for lords, favors the high class God over the low class God. Now, clearly, there's likely something to this. Odin <i>is</i> the God of kings and poets, magicians and wanderers. His myths don't feature much in the way of being a good, solid family man or a pillar of the community. Thor on the other hand, is a devoted husband and father, utterly reliable in warding Asgard from jotuns and trolls, and unfailingly brave. There's a lot here for more "down to earth" folks to find admirable.
</p>

<p>
Still, the thought that different groups of society each had "their own" God and treated the others with ridicule and contempt doesn't really jive with what we know about polytheistic societies. Yes, groups and individuals often have one or more Gods that they are closer to and give more worship to than others, but the idea of <i>putting down</i> Gods with whom you don't have much of a relationship seems like a projection from monotheistic norms. Sure, you got the <i>occasional</i> denigration of the Gods of enemies, but by far the norm was to treat all Gods, foreign and domestic, with <i>at least</i> distant cordiality and respect. These are, after all, powerful eternal beings that know and can do far more than you, so why risk it?
</p>

<p>
The other favored explanation for Thor's embarrassment in many of the Eddic poems is some combination of Christian influence and/or more common folktales shaping the poems, rather than some presumed older, more serious "religious" mythology. Again, while not impossible (remember, even the very oldest Eddic poems were written down, and likely composed, rather late in heathen times), and possibly part of the picture, this strikes me as not the best explanation either. Whatever else they are, the Eddic poems are works of highly-crafted poetry. The "it's just folktales" argument also goes directly against the idea that these were composed by the high class poets opposed to the common folk in the earlier theory. As for the Christian influence argument, I think Kvilhaug's arguments from the past chapter on the decidedly heathen initiatory elements in many of the poems is pretty strong. We also have tales of later Christian poets <i>explicitly</i> mocking the Gods (like one guy calling Freyja "a bitch," for which he was banished), and the Eddic poems don't seem to do this (except maybe <i>Lokasenna</i>).
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, since I've never found these explanations very convincing, Kvilhaug's comes as a welcome alternative. Thor's seeming "bumbling" and the various humiliations he suffers are not attacks, rather they are <i>instruction</i> in his initiation, meant to impart lessons to the audience. This is a far more satisfying answer. So, how do these often comical scenes work as steps of an initiation? Let's explore.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org47c91f1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org47c91f1">Humiliation and Gender Role Reversal as Spiritual Growth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org47c91f1">
<p>
Kvilhaug points out that the Thor we see in the Eddic poetry is in many ways the stereotypical viking warrior: macho, proud, strong, brave, and ready to solve all problems with violence, to the point of being hot-headed. Notice that often, this is <i>exactly</i> what the Gods need to get out of one scrape or another - Thor shows up to run off Loki or the jotun who's causing trouble, or just kill him. In a few poems, though, like <i>Harbardhsljodh</i>, <i>Thrymskvidha</i>, and <i>Hymiskvidha</i>, Thor is made fun of, shown up, or forced to engage in shameful behavior. <i>Harbardhsljodh</i> is basically an extended ridiculing of Thor by Odin in disguise, meeting every boast of Thor's about his strength and prowess in battle with put downs and counter-brags about handiness with women. Besides <i>Lokasenna</i>, this is one of the harder poems to square with devout, worshiping heathens that revered both Gods. Again in <i>Thrymskvidha</i>, Thor has His hammer stolen out from under his nose and ends up having to dress as a bride and all but consummate a wedding to a jotun. In <i>Hymiskvidha</i>, Thor isn't humiliated quite so much, but he does have to heed the crafty advice of his/Tyr's mother (I've seen both interpretations) rather than take his preferred direct approach, and Hymir thwarts him catching the Midgard Serpent. In all of these, Thor's default of "smash it with Mjolnir and sort it out afterward!" is somehow shown not to be the way, and in all cases, the right path somehow involved women.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug makes good use of more-or-less Jungian scheme of what masculine/feminine beings and traits are doing in myth that she introduced way back in <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_1_introduction_and_the_books_of_old">chapter 1</a> when talking through this stuff. She also makes some interesting comparisons to the trope from martial arts movies of the young, talented hot head who has to discover that being an arrogant jerk that can kick everybody's ass isn't the path to true wisdom or power (she does an extended run down of <i>Fearless</i>, starring Jet Li to make this point). I thought her analysis of what's going on in <i>Harbardhsljodh</i> made especially good use of her paradigm, pointing out that Odin's bragging about getting with the ladies might have been less about His being all-time greatest player and more about His achievement of the spiritual accomplishments that bring about union with the "Lady with the Mead," as described in earlier chapters. Likewise, His making fun of Thor for fighting women is likely less about Him being a chickpuncher and more about Him failing the test to confront the ugly ogress appropriately so that she transforms into the shining maiden, again, as a path to spiritual enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Thor dressing up as a bride in <i>Thrymskvidha</i> may be more than a funny story about the mighty God being made a fool of. It might represent the need to embrace the feminine parts of His personality to overcome certain obstacles and reach greater wisdom and power. Kvilhaug argues that both of these stories (and arguably, also the story of Utgardhsloki given by Snorri) are about humiliation as a tool for breaking down the pride of the ego, and I think she's likely onto something. In <i>Hymiskvidha</i>, Thor has finally learned his lesson and readily acquiesces to the wisdom of His/Tyr's mother and so achieves His goals with minimal fuss (and when the jotnar decide to attack Him anyway, He gets to flex His still mighty fighting skills). The idea that we all have both masculine and feminine parts within us, but that many of us have trouble getting in touch with the part that doesn't match our bodily sex will be familiar to anyone who has read much Jung at all, and again, I think Kvilhaug makes good use of this framework for thinking here. She goes a <i>bit</i> overboard with bringing in modern gender theory and politics, but that's not really necessary to her wider point, which I think is pretty sound.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb150f1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbb150f1">Kvilhaug's Personal Experience with Thor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb150f1">
<p>
Kvilhaug closes the chapter with something a bit on the odd side, but that I appreciated: an account of one of her own spiritual experiences that has informed how she understands Thor. These kinds of things can easily veer either into "too personal to mean anything to anyone else" or else "grandiose claims about unique insight into the nature of reality." Kvilhaug dodges both of these pitfalls admirably. She is careful to stress the subjective nature of what occurred, acknowledges that she can make no claims as to whether it was "all in her head" or in contact with something outside of herself, and all of the mundane factors that may have contributed to it. For my part, I'm grateful for a writer to share this kind of very personal experience, as it helps cast some light on the arguments she makes elsewhere, but again, she's careful not to be weirdly dogmatic or proselytizing about it or the like.
</p>

<p>
As I said, this was a very solid chapter, and I wish we had gotten more like this. So, as we come to the final step in our journey, let's see how the last chapter goes!

<h2 id="a_boast_for_2024" class="Post">A Boast for 2024</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a_boast_for_2024">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-December-31
</p>

<p>
One of the core rituals of Heathenry is the <i>symbel</i> (pronounced "soom-bull"), a round of communal toasts given in honor of the Gods, the community, and the forebears. You can find a detailed write-up of how to do one right by Galina Krasskova <a href="https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2023/11/26/a-bit-about-symbol/">here</a>. In the course of giving toasts, some of them may appropriately take the form of "boasts" about deeds accomplished or promised. Now, this deserves a little unpacking. Usually, the word "boast" has connotations of empty, swaggering words, but if done right, a symbel boast should be nothing of the sort. Instead, it is a commitment in front of Gods and men that you <i>will</i> do this thing, or an acknowledgment that accomplishing the thing relied on the strength and support you gained from them, if it has already been done. It's a way of asking your community to bind their will and <i>wyrd</i> (destiny, roughly) to yours. If you do the thing, you bring good luck and strength to everyone who shared in the toast with you. On the other hand, if you fail, you weaken them and bring bad luck. So, boasts should not be entered into lightly, and should be given in a sense of earnest commitment, not as an attention-getting brag.
</p>

<p>
With all that out of the way, for the past <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#reading_goal_for_2022">two</a> <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">years</a> I have made a boast for the coming year to my online community, and this year, I want to do so again. I [][already] mentioned the nature of this year's boast, but I like to craft a poem to be given with the actual "toast."
</p>

<blockquote>
Hail Gods<br>
Great and mighty,<br>
welcome world-crafters!<br>
Ale I lift<br>
to Ese* shining,<br>
beloved life-shapers.<br>

Hail Forebears<br>
Far-spread about,<br>
and full-told through time!<br>
To you I toast<br>
with tumbler high,<br>
wellsprings of widespread kin.<br>

May coming year<br>
kindly yield<br>
blissful blessings to all<br>
Boldly will I<br>
a book full-write<br>
on prayers of fair praise.<br>
\* <i>Ese</i> is a proposed Anglo-Saxon version of <i>Aesir</i>, the chief tribe of the Gods, and which can be used to refer to all Gods, even the <i>Wen/Vanir</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, if you are reading this and are willing to bond your strength and will with mine, I invite you to share a toast of your favorite beverage with me (virtually, of course), and to mark some accomplishment of the past year or a firm intention for the coming year. May our bound strength of purpose help both of us along to our goals.
</p>

<p>
Hail reader and friend!

<h3 id="org1c20255">My Boast - A Blog Post a Week All Year</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1c20255">
<p>
To meet this boast, I gave myself 5 "misses," where I didn't get anything up on time, as long as I made it up within the next week, and 5 "placeholder" posts, where I posted something without much substantive content, but on time. Here's how that worked out. For the sake of this rule, I am counting "after midnight but before I went to bed" as being "still Sunday."
</p>

<b>Missed the Deadline</b>: 3 (but never by more than 1 day, if that means anything!)<br>
<b>Placeholder Posted</b>: 2<br>
<b>Missed the Deadline, and Made Up For It With a Placeholder</b>: 0<br>

<p>
Overall, this suggests I was a bit generous with the wiggle room I allowed myself. Also, looking at where I used placeholders, as well as where I was late, it was mostly holidays of one kind or another. This wouldn't have been a problem if not for my "Just In Time" writing and posting, where almost every post was written over the weekend that it got posted. Overall, I think the placeholders were a better option than flat-out missing a week, and I should have fallen back to that more often (which was the whole point of having it as an option). Instead, I found myself with a post 1/2 or 2/3 written and then not being able to wrap it up by Sunday evening. I had hoped for a getting into a better rhythm, especially one with more of a break between writing and editing, so that I could give editing more of the attention it deserves. It's tough finding the right balance between "just focus on getting something finished and out there every week" and "edit your posts for lasting value and quality." The good news is that I've gotten to the point where writing a blog post feels like a normal part of my workload and life on a weekly basis, so I think I'll try to keep that up.

<h3 id="org3b19238">Reading</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b19238">
<p>
After <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">last year's boast</a>, I did not put any particular constraint on my reading this year, but I did try to make it a priority. One way I did that was to write book reviews, bringing together my weekly blogging and my desire to spend time reading. Another way was to recommit to reading fiction regularly (ideally, at least about ten minutes before bed every night). Part of how I made that more likely was to let myself read whatever fiction I was interested in or excited about, whereas in the past I've sometimes tried to alternate between "lighter" and "weightier" fiction. I also didn't read as many comics this year, though that was less out of some intention, and more that I didn't discover as many comics as I have in years past. One thing that continued to pull <i>against</i> reading more books was continuing to read a lot of blogs. There's a lot of good stuff on substack, and I've been keeping up with more of it than I did in the past, but I'm wondering if I ought to put some stricter limits on what or how much stuff from blogs I read - not because I think it's "bad," but simply the cruel implacability of opportunity cost - an hour spent reading a long-form article is an hour <i>not</i> spent reading a chapter in a book.
</p>

<p>
Though it's a vanity metric, "number of books read" is at least helpful to me for spotting major trends in how I spend my time on the input side of things. A huge spike in "books read" might mean I read a lot of graphic novels, which I can finish in an evening. A big dip might be because I was reading big, fat doorstops like <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_6_odds_and_ends">Spengler</a> or reading a crap ton of blog posts instead, or maybe both. So, how did this year stack up? Unless I tear through a novella or some graphic novels, it looks like I'm finishing the year with 42 (<a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">heh</a>) books, 32 of which were not graphic novels. This is <i>way</i> higher than last year's 17 books, but much closer to 2022's 46, some of which I discussed in my lookback on reading only books by the dead I linked a moment ago. I should also point out that I have a handful of books, maybe 3-5 that are "in process" - I've been reading them, am actively planning on continuing to do so, but I've only been reading in bits and pieces, or at certain times, like <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> by William James, which I bring with me when I need to wait on an appointment, or for my daughter to do her dance class. This habit is likely unhelpful, and I should unify my will on one reading project at a time. You'll find proponents for both "only one book at a time, always" as well as "dip in and out of as many books as you want, it's great!" with the latter being seen in its most extreme form as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Given how strongly I am drawn by "ooh, shiny new ideas!" as well as the amount of variety I'm already getting from my hyper-customized magazine that is substack, I likely need to lean more heavily toward the focus end of things.

<h3 id="org2994a7f">Note-Taking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2994a7f">
<p>
At some point last year, I started keeping an <a href="https://www.scottscheper.com/free-guide">analog zettelkasten</a>, and by some measures, I've kept up with that. I say "by some measures," because I haven't been as consistent with it as I'd like. I've done a very good job of taking notes on what I'm reading on "bib cards" (you make a card with bibliographic information on the book or article, then take reading notes on the back of it), an okay job on writing cards to go into my zettelkasten, but a kind of terrible job on "filing" or "installing" those cards - giving them an index number and writing it down in my key. The little use I have made of this set up keeps me convinced I ought to stick with it, but I've yet to develop the core habit of writing and installing "main cards" as I go. By all accounts, this gets easier as your key/index gets more robust, as adding key entries is one of the hurdles, but I haven't pushed past that just yet. We'll see how things go in 2024.

<h3 id="org5d3719f">Spiritual Work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d3719f">
<p>
I've been pretty consistent with my spiritual work, doing a daily <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/57125.html">banishing ritual</a>, <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/65232.html">discursive meditation</a>, and divination of one kind or another. There's been a handful of days where I had to do a placeholder (like only doing 5 minutes of breathing for my meditation, or a shorter ritual), and another handful where I missed one or more of the practices all together. Even still, I scryed each of the stations of the Wheel of Life and each of the fews of the Ogham and have worked my way into the fourth grade of the <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-dolmen-arch-a-study-course-in-the-druid-mysteries-volume-1-the-lesser-mysteries-john-m-greer/18188126?ean=9781935006916">Dolmen Arch</a>, nearing the end of the "Lesser Mysteries." I also worked my way up to the master level of the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/207129.html">Modern Order of Essenes</a> and began work in the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/248074.html">Universal Gnostic Church seminary</a> on my way to ordination in that rather quirky religious body. I plan on keeping up with the same going into next year - I can't do any advanced ceremonial magic until my younger daughter is three, so I won't be exploring that end of the <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-druid-magic-handbook-ritual-magic-rooted-in-the-living-earth-john-michael-greer/6897361?ean=9781578633975">Druid Magic Handbook</a> in the coming year, but I have plenty to keep me busy with study, meditation, and a weekly scrying.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1c9630">
<p>
If you haven't seen at the top of the page or bottom each new post, I'm starting a mailing list for updates to the blog. Personally, I like getting email updates for new blog posts (I subscribe to a bunch of substacks), so I decided I ought to extend the same courtesy to you, gentle reader. I've been holding off on doing this for not wanting to use a corporate tool like mailchimp and not knowing an open source option, but I decided to stop using that as an excuse and just go low tech. For now, that means that to get on the mailing list, you just send me an email saying so, and I put your email address on a list. Each week, when a post goes out, I'll copy and paste it into an email and send it to everyone on the list. Presumably I'll find a better way of handling it as we go, but for now, I wanted to get a minimally viable product going.
</p>

<p>
The other thing for the year is I'm setting myself an ambitious goal: I'm going to finish crafting the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> and write a book about it. I don't yet know what all will go into that book, besides the prayers and how to say them, but this feels like an important step for me: my boasts for the last two years have been very "process" oriented - only read books by dead guys, crank out a blog post weekly. I think it will do me some good to have something more concrete to go after, and I've been meaning to write a book for years, so here we go.

Still another short one, before a medium penultimate chapter and a long final chapter. Still, the end of the tunnel is in sight! I know I keep harping on the same things, but they all seem linked together, and as I go through the book, they become more of a problem. Better organization and editing would have meant less redundancy, as well as shorter length. The good insights (which, again, are definitely here) could shine out all the more clearly were that the case. Ah well, let's talk about the male path of initiation now that we've talked about the female path and the sacred marriage.

<h3 id="org46ce691">Odhin's Self-Giving Upon the Tree</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org46ce691">
<p>
If you have spent any time with the Heathen lore at all, you have come across the tale of Odhinn hanging himself upon the World Tree, Yggdrasill, a sacrifice of himself to himself, by which he won the runes and maybe even his very godhood, as relayed in <i>Havamal</i>. One thing that's curious about this tale, though, is that it is <i>not</i> told of Odhinn in Snorri's <i>Prose Edda</i>. Maybe <i>the</i> defining story of the king of the Gods, and Snorri just left it out? Curious. Kvilhaug has made this point before, but she makes it more fully here - maybe Snorri left it out because that story was too radioactive to 13th century Icelandic Christians. Too Heathen. Too magical. <i>Too much stepping on Christ's exclusive claim to resurrection</i>. It's always difficult to argue that the absence of evidence is evidence, but given how many clues we have that Snorri was familiar with most of the specific poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, the idea that he just flat didn't know <i>Havamal</i> seems odd. As happens often, I find Kvilhaug's confidence in her theory a <i>bit</i> much, but in this case, I think she's very likely on to something. At any rate, the reason she puts so much weight on this myth in this chapter is to make the claim that it provides the pattern for a possibly real-life initiation ritual, at least for high-status, spiritually important folks like kings, shamans, and esoteric seekers. Ordeal is a well-known path to altered states of consciousness, and is well-attested among the circumpolar folks who had shamans. Specifically, ordeal by some kind of <i>hanging</i> is known in some of these groups, so that's, at a minimum, suggestive. And fasting is a human universal. Now, nine days and nine nights with no food and water? I tend to suspect that's a length of time to prove His godly superiority, as the rule of thumb I learned in the Army is "three minutes without air, three hours without heat, three days without water, three weeks without food." Still, the core idea that some combination of fasting and ordeal was used by actual spiritual specialists in the Viking world seems quite likely to me, and the idea that <i>Havamal</i> reflects that seems just about as likely.

<h3 id="orgd581d57">Yeah, But Isn't a Self-Sacrificing God Just a Copycat of Christ?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd581d57">
<p>
How much Christian influence there is in the versions of the myths we have is hotly debated, both among scholars and practicing Heathens. The written versions we have were written down by Christians, and in some cases, transmitted through Christians before being written down. Some of our sources, like Saxo Grammaticus, <i>hated</i> the old Heathen ways and went out of their way to put them down and make them look bad (Saxo's main approach was to euhemerize the old Gods into kings and wizards of elder times and then tell the most unflattering stories about them as proof of how wicked they were). Some, like the unknown scribes who copied down the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> and added a few prose bits to introduce and stitch together the poems <i>seem</i> to have been happy to just say "here's the old stuff, they believed different things back then, because they didn't know any better." Others, like Snorri, walked some kind of middle ground, retelling the stories in his own words, and in a way calculated not to alarm Church authorities, but that made it clear he did not <i>believe</i> any of this unChristian nonsense. Further complicating matters is the policy that the Church used at the time of co-opting local holy sites, practices, and even (to some degree) beliefs, but with updated, Christian meanings, as a method of conversion - so we <i>know</i> that pre-Christian stuff in Germanish-speaking lands and elsewhere got re-painted by Christians (the Celtic lands got this good and hard, as a reading of the <i>Mabinogion</i> or any Irish legends will show pretty quickly). All of which is to say that it's not crazy at all for modern folks to ask "okay, how much Christian influence might there be in the lore as we have it now?" and it's not easy to answer that non-crazy question.
</p>

<p>
The two tales that might get the most debate about Christian influence, though, are of Odhin's self-sacrifice upon Yggdrasill, and the "final" battle of <i>Ragnarok</i>. We'll leave aside Ragnarok for now, as this chapter focuses on Odhin's self-sacrifice. If you haven't heard it before, or if it's not clear to you, here's the argument for Christian influence: Odhinn hangs himself upon a tree, willingly, wounded by a spear, where he dies and comes back to life with a spiritual gift for all of mankind (the Runes). A "tree" was one of the preferred ways to talk about the Cross at the time in the Germanish-speaking world (see the Old English <a href="https://oldenglishpoetry.camden.rutgers.edu/dream-of-the-rood/">Dream of the Rood</a>). "Hanging" isn't exactly being crucified, but it's not <i>that</i> different either (especially because the Old Norse leaves it a bit ambiguous whether Odhinn was hanged or hung - a noose around the neck, or suspended in some other way?). The spear wound mirrors that said to have been given to Christ by Longinus. In the <i>Heliand</i>, a continental Saxon retelling of the Gospels, used as a conversion text, the spiritual truths that Christ teaches are called <i>Runes</i>. All of which is to say that the pro-Christian influence argument is not baselessly making stuff up - it's a plausible inference to make.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug, though, lays out one of the best takedowns of the Christian-influence theory (for this myth, anyway) that I've seen. This is one of those places where her contrariness and apparent lack of sympathy for (if not to say possible hostility toward) Christianity come in handy. She goes through each element of the myth and identifies its Heathen precedent and long pedigree. Hanging and strangulation as forms of sacrifice are attested archaeologically from before the time of Christ. The idea of a World Tree, and an ordeal upon it, has <i>very</i> strong and deep shamanic and/or Indo-European roots. The spear was Odhin's signature weapon, and again, that seems to be <i>very</i> old. And while the <i>Havamal</i> is a bit ambivalent about whether the <i>Runes</i> it speaks of are the system of writing, the association of writing, magic, and spiritual truths/secrets ("Rune" comes from a word that means "secret") is also very old. All of which is to say, <i>everything</i> in the <i>Havamal</i> tale is at least plausibly drawn from pre-Christian tradition. Kvilhaug goes so far as to basically say this is a slam dunk that it was not influenced by Christianity, but I think that's going a bit far on the evidence. I'd say she makes an excellent case that the Christian influence is not <i>obvious</i> or <i>necessary</i> for the tales to be the way they are. On the other hand, there's almost no way to say "yep, no Christian influence here" absent some kind of pre-Christian written evidence. This whole area is one where I'd really like to see a deep, well-informed analysis by someone without any axes to grind. Christian influence doesn't leave Heathen material lacking spiritual significance, and the persistence of Heathen elements doesn't imply a lack of piety on the part of Germanish-speaking Christians.

<h3 id="org06eb799">The Steps of Initiation Clearly Laid Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org06eb799">
<p>
Though it's a bit repetitive from what Kvilhaug told us back in chapter 3 about "The Maiden with the Mead," we get the most clearly-spelled-out analysis of the initiation myth structure that she relies on that I've yet seen here in this chapter. Would I prefer she had just laid this out back in chapter 3? Yes. Am I happy to have it anyway? Of course. This kind of explicit "here are the steps, each step has a name, here's an example of each step happening" stuff is <i>exactly</i> what I want more of from Kvilhaug. This is helpful! She has a clear analytical framework that has done her a lot of good in understanding a wide range of tales - why not share that tool with us as well? Again, here, she does, so I'm grateful for that, but it's <i>after</i> she has spent chapters and chapters talking about stories with this framework obviously influencing what she's saying, but without making it as clear and explicit as she dos here. I just want some better organization! I'll likely have more to say on this when I write up my thoughts on the book as a whole, but once again, it's clear to me that what I <i>really</i> want from Kvilhaug is a well-organized and impeccably-cited reference work - something like Simek's <i>Dictionary of Northern Mythology</i>, but with her fanatical emphasis on the raw, plain meaning of names and conviction that most myths are blueprints for real-life rituals of one kind or another. That would be <i>so useful</i>. And rad. Alas, that does not seem to be where her strengths or energy lie, so I'll have to settle for her sharing very useful insights in long, rambly, repetitive prose. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCpjgl2baLs">Le sigh</a>.

This one's another short chapter, and once again is a bit repetitive and is a transcription of Youtube videos, so it's not the most helpful chapter. Still, there's a few interesting tidbits, and we're pushing through, so let's get to it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcece24e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcece24e">Sacred Marriage as a Middle Eastern Import</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcece24e">
<p>
This whole chapter suffers somewhat from Kvilhaug's (I believe) mistaken take on history. For one, she comes back to the "pre-Indo-European culture was a bunch of peaceful matriarchs" Maria Gimbujtas-inspired stuff which is almost certainly very wrong. What's frustrating is that she makes some claims to support this interpretation that might be very interesting to investigate, but doesn't give any sources: for example, she claims that ancient DNA samples show that the women in this pre-Bronze Age culture stayed local, while it was the men who came from elsewhere, based on burials. This very well could indicate matrilineal traditions, without necessarily being a "matriarchy," but given how fast and loose she's played with historical/archaeological evidence elsewhere, I'm not wholly convinced. Secondly, she seeks to redeem some of Snorri's euhemerized history of the <i>Aesir</i> - namely, that they came from Troy in Asia (Minor), which is where their name comes from. As I've said before, I'm all for giving ancient writers the benefit of the doubt when they describe things that seem to go against our current understanding of historiography, but Kvilhaug draws on an Anatolian-origin and cultural diffusion model of the spread of Indo-European folk and tongues in Europe, both of which I believe to be badly flawed. There's a great overview of the evidence for the origin and spread of the Indo-Europeans <a href="https://nemets.substack.com/p/proto-indo-european-urheimat-debate">here</a>, and to be fair, the Anatolian origin theory seems like the second most likely one to me. On the other hand "cultural diffusion" is right out - the Indo-Europeans replaced most of the "First Farmers" and Hunter Gatherers in a big way, as the ancient and modern DNA evidence shows.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Kvilhaug asserts that maybe the Nordic Bronze Age (likely the archaeological culture associated with the Proto-Germanic tongue and folk) came from Turkey, which suggests contact with Mesopotamia, which means the archaeological and mythological evidence for "sacred marriages" in Nordic lands may have been a direct transmission from the very well-attested tradition of sacred marriage in Mesopotamia. As I've implied, I'm not so convinced of this. Instead, one of two options seems more likely to me: 1. the concept of a "sacred marriage" is just baked into human psychology, it's a deep enough archetype that it'll pop up independently around the world, or 2. if there is a common origin for this mythic/ritual complex, it's <i>way</i> old, and is a common ancestor to Mesopotamian and Norse sources. There's also the interesting, but highly speculative, theory that early contact with Proto-Indo-Europeans influenced Mesopotamian myth, not the other way around (I had a source for this, and I can't find it right now, which is immensely frustrating. Short version is that the "cut up a proto-God to make the world" myth is well-attested in comparative Indo-European myth, and then shows up in the Babylonian <i>Enuma Elish</i> for some reason). Anyhow, I find Kvilhaug's speculations that the Norse were somehow <i>literally</i> continuing the Ishtar/Inanna cult not very convincing at all.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org255c4d6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org255c4d6">Odhin's Winning of the Mead in the Havamal against Snorri's Telling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org255c4d6">
<p>
What I found more interesting in this chapter is Kvilhaug's pointing out that the version of Odhinn winning the Mead of Poetry given in <i>Havamal</i> differs quite a bit from Snorri's prose version. Snorri's more familiar version (presumably because it's spelled out in more detail) has Odhinn sneak into the mountain where Suttungr has hidden the Mead under the guardianship of his daughter, Gunnlodh. Odhinn spends three nights with her in exchange for three drinks of the mead, which he uses to drink up all of it and then escapes in the shape of an eagle. The version in <i>Havamal</i>, though, has Odhinn demonstrate his eloquence and power via spell-songs to Suttungr and then swear a ring-oath, presumably of marriage to Gunnlodh. It's told in the allusive form of poetry, so it's hard to know everything for certain, but the two versions definitely have different vibes. Kvilhaug connects the <i>Havamal</i> version with the "sacred marriage" theme of the chapter, which is potentially interesting, even if her speculations about where that theme came from prove to be wrong. Kvilhaug thinks that the <i>Havamal</i> version, being older and written by Heathens, is the "correct" version, but I suspect it's more complicated than that, as it usually is with mythology. I suspect that both versions have something to teach us about Odhinn, Gunnlodh, and the Mead. One consistent element, though, is that Odhinn <i>leaves</i>, which is interesting. Kvilhaug believes that this symbolizes how the spirit of mankind has become separated from the source of divine inspiration and so has to seek it. That seems reasonable, at least as <i>an</i> interpretation, if not <i>the</i> interpretation, but it's not exactly consistent with how else she's interpreted this myth elsewhere. Again, though, consistency isn't exactly a requirement in getting meaning out of myths, so maybe the point's moot.

This was one of the shortest chapters yet, which worked out nicely, as I'm typing this on an unexpectedly long layover for international travel, and I'm not sure how much more time I'll be able to devote to a post this weekend. ALso, much like the last chapter, this one deals with material that Kvilhaug has gone into earlier in the book, but I'd say she does a better job here of not repeating herself and referring you back to those earlier chapters. In this case, Kvilhaug expands on the role played by magical tutelary women by focusing on their depictions as <i>seidhr</i> workers - witches.
</p>

<h3 id="org7ffb80b">The "Witches" of Elder Times were Respected, Not Outcasts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7ffb80b">
<p>
We start off with a bit of an overview of both the mythological instances of Goddesses and other (semi) divine beings being shown as seidhr women, as well as some of the history of real-life prophetesses. Overall, this bit is pretty good, especially for providing references of where <i>volur</i> (plural of <i>volva</i>) show up, but some of Kvilhaug's chip-on-the shoulder about Christian persecution of pagans and women comes in, a bit stronger than I think is necessarily warranted (again, it's not that she's totally wrong, it's just that she bangs on it a bit more than I think is needed). She makes the argument, I think credibly, that for the most part, "witches" (a term she uses in a way I infer is meant to "reclaim" the term, as Wiccans have tried to do) were not seen as dangerous outcasts, but rather as honored and important members not only of society, but its ruling elite. One of the more interesting parts was the exception she uses to prove the rule. The Goths expelled their "witches" not long after moving to the area around the Black Sea on accusations of "dark magic" of some kind (I was not clear from her text if this happened before or after their conversion to Christianity). Centuries later, though, when the Goths were driven west by the invading Huns, they said that the Huns were descended from those exiled women, who had bred a race of devils - so this was not some minor footnote of a historical event, it was something remembered for centuries and associated with the greatest calamity to befall their folk.

Kvilhaug has argued earlier in the book that the <i>Poetic Edda</i> is a coherent whole, not a random collection of unrelated poems, but in this chapter, she says that the thread that gives them coherence is precisely that they trace a path of initiation, the Old Norse mystery religion she talked about in the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_7_death_and_resurrection">last chapter</a>. The idea that the heroic poems had such a unifying thread was interesting and exciting enough, but the thought that the whole <i>Poetic Edda</i> can be read in such a way is very interesting and exciting, if it turns out to work. I'll have to do a lot more reading and bethinking of my own to really make my own call. Of smaller implication, but even more interesting for being something I don't think I've encountered before, Kvilhaug also argues that the <i>Voluspa</i> stands as a summary of the entire rest of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> (and, by the argument in this chapter, thus of the entire Old Norse Mystery Religion). Now, there's no doubt that the <i>Voluspa</i> is the most central work of Heathen cosmology, but casting it as a microcosm of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>'s macrocosm is very intriguing - again, I'll have to give some real time to bethinking on this.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60d7466">
<p>
Forgive me for being a bit flippant with the header here, I couldn't resist the reference to the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Magical_girl">silly anime genre</a>, but this bit was actually really interesting and useful. Besides the examples we've already seen of Valkyries and Goddesses taking care of their favored male followers/consorts/initiates in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, Kvilhaug takes us through <i>a lot</i> of examples of warriors getting trained by "otherworldly" women of various stripes from the <i>fornaldarsogur</i>, the subset of the Icelandic sagas that is less dramatized history and more folklore and fairy tales. In these tales, the woman sometimes "merely" knows how to do magic, but other times is a valkyrie or giantess, but in all of them that Kvilhaug surveys, a young warrior spends some amount of time with one of these women, sometimes as a prisoner, sometimes as a lover, sometimes as both (there's a very <i>Odyssey</i> vibe to some of these), and during this time is taught some kind of secret wisdom - spells, the special way to defeat an otherwise invulnerable foe, or how to avoid a deadly or inglorious fate. In almost all cases, the warrior must demonstrate courage and steadfastness, and is rewarded with some combination of magical and temporal power and the favors of the woman or her daughter. As I said, there are apparently a lot of examples of these in the stories, and it seems worth tracking down and reading these references for more insight and bethinking material.

This chapter mostly covered topics that have come up before, so my thoughts might be briefer than they otherwise would be, especially given the weighty nature of what this chapter covers: death and rebirth. The very short version is that Kvilhaug argues that the Old Norse believed that at least some souls reincarnated, and that souls faced different fates after death depending on what wisdom they did (or didn't) develop during life, and that wisdom comes from encounters with one or more Gods or Goddesses, which are manifestations of an underlying unified divinity. Want to dig in more? Let's get to it.

<h3 id="org9af22e3">Maybe Elves are Just Folks Who Won at Spirituality</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9af22e3">
<p>
I've long been curious what to make of Elves in the Germanic lore, and Kvilhaug helps shed some more light on them, but not so much for me to be fully satisfied. Where does this confusion come from? We have lots of references to "elves" as some kind of group of conscious beings, but the <i>kind</i> of conscious being referred to seems to vary rather a lot. A dead king buried in a mound became known as "The Elf of Geirstad." A Christian traveler was barred from entering a farm because they were giving sacrifice to "elves." The God Frey is said to live in <i>Alfheim</i>, the home/land/world of Elves, is called a Lord of Elves, and sometimes seems to be called an Elf himself. And that's without even getting into the fact that Snorri talks about both "light" and "dark" elves, and that "dark elves" may or may not be the same thing as the <i>dvergr</i>, dwarves. Further complicating things, as with everywhere else, later Germanic folklore is full of beings that get up to mischief and have various interactions with humans, like the fae of Celtic lands, and some of the names of these beings are etymologically linked with Elves (like, you know, the word "elf").
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug's interpretation is, as you might imagine, a bit dependent on her metaphysical/theological presuppositions, my reservations about which I've shared, but I think it has some merit. She sees "elf" as a label for a soul that has transcended reincarnation to live eternally outside of materiality. As such, Gods are elves, enlightened dead humans are elves, and presumably, any other conscious spirit sufficiently in touch with the divine is an elf. This does a good job of sidestepping the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Monster_Manual">Gygaxian</a> desire to divide all beings into neat mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive categories based on different names. Kvilhaug plays to her strengths here, being willing to see overlap and fluid borders where others look to make them as firm as possible. That being said, this also brings up the downside of her approach: the utility of "elf" as a label depends on her interpretation of souls reincarnating, reaching spiritual enlightenment, and moving on to some other kind of existence being the view of the afterlife the Old Norse had. If you don't buy that theory, then her solution to the elf puzzle isn't so helpful.
</p>

<p>
Synchronistically enough, as I was about to start writing this post, I read this short <a href="https://readoldthings.dreamwidth.org/89237.html">post</a> by readoldthings over on Dreamwidth. He includes a short passage from the <i>Odyssey</i> about the Naiads and nymphs and references an analysis of it by Plotinus. His interpretation is that the nymphs are nature spirits and seem to be the same kind of being as the Fae in Celtic lands. What's most interesting for this discussion is that Plotinus argues that Homer is saying that these nature spirits are, in fact, souls between human incarnations. I had never encountered this idea before, and it's a remarkable piece of comparative evidence to set next to beliefs in the Fae, Elves, and other ambiguous (to us) spiritual beings.

<h3 id="orga95a05e">Kvilhaug Argues the Old Norse Believed in Reincarnation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga95a05e">
<p>
By this point in the book, Kvilhaug has made no secret of her interpretation of the lore as indicating that the heathens of elder times believed in reincarnation, at least sometimes, at least for some folks. When I first encountered the idea that there might be reincarnation in the Germanish lore, I was pretty skeptical - I had only ever heard of reincarnation as a Hindu and Buddhist belief, or as a modern New Agey one that got it from those older sources. Since then, though, I've encountered a lot of evidence that has caused me to <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#hold-on-to-what-you-believe">change those beliefs</a>. I now suspect that a belief in reincarnation likely goes back <i>at least</i> to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">Proto-Indo-Europeans</a>, and that some elements of those beliefs likely lingered in the various folks whose religions and tongues came from them well into historical times - sometimes very obviously, as in India, sometimes in ways that were obvious to ancients but aren't well known today (Pythagoras and his followers taught the transmigration of souls, multiple Roman writers commented that the Celts believed in reincarnation, and so forth), and sometimes in tiny little snippets like we find in the Germanish lore.
</p>

<p>
In the Germanish lore, one of the most direct pieces of evidence is unfortunately also one of the less credible: in the <i>Codex Regius</i>, the first-found and still most important manuscript of most of what we today call the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, there's a prose snippet between two poems, given by the Christians who wrote it down, saying that "back then before they knew about Christ, they believed that folks can be reborn." Mark that I said <i>less</i> credible, and not "not credible at all." Those Christian monks were much closer to the beliefs of elder times than we are today, and my general starting place is to assume that the writers of long ago actually knew what they were talking about unless we have strong reason to believe otherwise - a kind of historiographic Chesterton's fence, if you will. But it's not as direct as Socrates/Plato saying "okay, here's exactly how reincarnation works, I got it from a guy who talked to a guy who died and was revived and saw it all happen" at the end of the <i>Republic</i>. Instead, you have scattered references that the old Norse seem to have believed that at least something from someone who died could come back later. Kvilhaug leans towards the maximalist end of interpretation here, but I think she makes a pretty good case. Specifically, she argues that many of the human heroes in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, especially both Helgis, should be seen as a series of incarnations of the same soul. That being said, she goes more into that particular analysis more in earlier chapters. At any rate, since reincarnation is consistent with the teachings I currently work with, I find this approach reasonable, interesting, and useful.

<h3 id="orgded701f">What is the Underworld like, and Why Would You Go There?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgded701f">
<p>
Kvilhaug spends some time going through various descriptions of the underworld, most of which is pretty familiar, but she does point out two things that I think are interesting and possibly worth looking more into. The first is that the earlier descriptions of Hel's realm include more positive elements, unlike the better-known stereotype of Valhalla as a raucous good time and Hel as dreary wasteland, which is found more in later sources. Now, the idea of the underworld as dark, dreary, and generally unpleasant is very old and very widespread (at least among Indo-European folks), so it's not like Hel <i>wasn't</i> those things in the older sources, but it was apparently <i>also</i> a place with warm, inviting neighborhoods. I'm not sure what it means that the later heathens seem to have felt that any warm and inviting afterlife destinations were somehow <i>not</i> Hel, if earlier ones thought otherwise, but it might be worth thinking about and looking more into.
</p>

<p>
The second thing Kvilhaug points out that I think I might want to look into more deeply is that whenever someone living visits the underworld, there is a loud, "resounding" sound. Kvilhaug argues that this is a characteristic of a shamanic spiritual journey of some kind. As I've talked about in earlier posts, I've long been curious about the (maybe) shamanic elements in Germanish lore and practices, so finding more potential comparative elements always grabs my attention. But wait a tick, what the heck are living guys doing in the underworld? In just about every case, it's to <i>learn</i> some kind of secret wisdom. Again, Kvilhaug covered all of this in more detail in earlier chapters, such as the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_3_the_maiden_with_the_mead">Maiden with the Mead</a>, but it's interesting to mark that when the living go to the underworld for this knowledge, they're still obviously different from the souls that show up because they're dead.

<h3 id="org5f5797e">Death as a Lover</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5f5797e">
<p>
This is one section where I was hoping for a bit more of Kvilhaug's gathering up of examples to make a point - she does give examples, but at times just says things like "lots of skaldic poems use this imagery." Anyway, I'll pull the same trick here and say that Kvilhaug shares that often in Old Norse poetry, death was described as a woman welcoming the dying man as a lover. This is one place where I'm not sure about the comparative mythology, whether among the Indo-Europeans or elsewhere. Given the nearly equally deep significance of love/sex and death to human life, psychology, and spirituality, finding them combined in Old Norse belief is, well, suggestive, if nothing stronger. This feels like another of those areas that warrants further reading and bethinking.

<h3 id="orgf3eb814">The Many Many Worlds of Norse Belief</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3eb814">
<p>
Okay, I'm getting a bit cutesy with my header titles, but I couldn't resist. If you've spent any time with the Germanish lore at all, you've run into the thought that there is more than one "world" or <i>heimr</i>. The most commonly found count of those worlds is nine. What Kvilhaug lays out nice and clear is that there are actually multiple accounts given of how many worlds there are and what their names are, just among Old Norse works, without even touching other Germanish sources (such as the "seven worlds" of the <i>Nine Herbs Charm</i> in Old English). <i>Grimnismal</i> gives twelve "heavens," in nine of which "death rules," which Kvilhaug finds highly significant, especially since the three worlds where death does <i>not</i> rule are said to hold "elves," which she uses as evidence for her interpretation discussed above that "elves" are beings that have achieved immortality. Snorri describes ten "heavens," where, again, Kvilhaug sees the tenth as holding immortal "light elves," distinct from the beings in the other nine worlds. The variety here is interesting for a few reasons. For one, it's a good reminder not to be overly doctrinaire in how we interpret the lore and what it might mean for our beliefs and practice - many of us were raised in religious traditions that put great weight on the strict <i>accuracy</i> of texts, and it can be hard to shake the desire to figure out what the "real" meaning of a set of religiously-significant texts "really is." Another reason its helpful is the exact opposite of dogmatic certainty: multiple versions, with different numbers, names, and characteristics provides multiple sets of symbolism that can be meditated on, adapted to rituals, and compared with other sets of symbolism (10 worlds would be super handy if you're trying to map things to the Sephiroth, for example, or twelve could be handy if you want to have four trinities, and so forth).

<h3 id="org8a2c940">There May Have Been a Norse Mystery Religion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8a2c940">
<p>
In one of the more interesting things from this chapter for me, Kvilhaug <i>does</i> bring in some comparative material and talks about classical mystery cults, specifically the Eleusinian Mysteries and the cult of Isis. (Quick Aside: "cult" here has none of the modern negative connotation. In academic literature, "cult" is used to mean any specific body of practice and belief, often to stress the fact that participation in a specific cult was not necessarily exclusive - going and doing the Eleusinian mysteries didn't make you an "Eleusinian" who couldn't do "regular" Greek religion anymore.) She talks about how Apuleius's <i>Golden Ass</i>, an allegorical tale of initiation dressed up as a fantastic, even slightly silly, fable, has many striking parallels with the path of initiation she's described being held in Norse poems in earlier chapters. I found this comparison fascinating, not least because I want to do a deeper dive on the Eleusinian Mysteries and their central myth of Hades carrying away Persephone to make Her His bride and compare it to Thjazi carrying away Idhunn for unspecified reasons (but I suspect they're the same). Where this section fell a bit short for me, though, was another greatest hit from this book: Kvilhaug goes further than I would like in identification of divine beings, stating that Isis was the Goddess behind all Goddesses, and making the argument that Freyja played a similar role for the Norse. Despite that, what's most interesting here is her contention that maybe the Norse, or at least some of them, had literal mystery cults where folks went, had a spiritually significant experience, and came away with a different view on life and the afterlife, and this might be hinted at in the poetry that has survived. This is another of those places where I think what we can explicitly prove by the records is far, far tinier than what we can reasonably infer by knowing about humans, history, culture, and religion, so I think she's very likely right.

<h3 id="org9e8ede8">Valhalla as a Metaphor for Reincarnation Gets a Bit Muddled</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9e8ede8">
<p>
Toward the end of the chapter, Kvilhaug has one of her weaker sections, despite a potentially interesting idea. The potentially interesting idea is that the image of Valhalla as a place where warriors fight every day, feast every night, and heal/resurrect to do it all over again the next day might be a metaphor for reincarnation, which is an endlessly repeated struggle until you figure out what you need to to move past it. What makes it weak is that it's fairly muddled, and in many places it contradicts things she's said, like giving Valhalla as an example of the eternal afterlife achieved by souls that have learned what they need to get away from reincarnation and claim their spiritual bride. It's also tainted by a bit of the snobbery we've talked about elsewhere, though here I think it's a bit more forgivable. Basically, Kvilhaug recognizes that most folks who have even heard of Valhalla picture something fairly cartoonish: burly manly men fighting all day and then drinking, feasting, and swiving all night. Is that a bit simplistic and focused on the bodily appetites for a profound spiritual reward? Very likely so, yes. On the other hand, I don't think Valhalla is described that way <i>on accident</i>, nor do I think it was a cynical psyop by Viking kings to get their men to fight harder. There is something deeply appealing about that cartoonish afterlife for the kind of man who wants to go do dangerous things and cares more about living gloriously than living for a long time. The reason I'm fairly sympathetic to Kvilhaug is that I think her dismissal of that image mostly comes from taking the myths seriously and wanting others to do so, and she figures that if folks think "Viking religion was all about fighting and getting drunk, hell yeah!" then they might not notice the deeper stuff she has spent her adult life digging into and sharing with others. So, that's admirable enough, right? On the other hand, I think there's <i>something</i> there that Kvilhaug is missing in her haste to defend the spiritual profundity of these myths and maintain her self-image as a good, modern feminist - some reason that these profound myths painted a very vivid, appealing image of fighting <i>for real</i>, but without hatred or consequence, eating and drinking without cost, and being welcomed by women who were as fierce and formidable as they were welcoming and attractive. My own guess, at this point, is that it's meant to point to the attractions behind the attraction, the goal behind the goal - whatever it is we should <i>truly</i> want cannot be described, for it is beyond the experience of this life. The closest we can come is to imagine what we most intensely want in this life, but then make it even better by removing the drawbacks that are inherent in whatever we want in this material existence. But I dunno, I need to bethink on it more.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org865909c">
<p>
Overall, there were several things I found interesting and helpful in this chapter, but the amount of meat on the bone is getting a little light compared to earlier chapters. Much of what was most relevant or interesting had already been said in more detail in earlier chapters, but was also not simply a reference saying "go back and read chapter 3 for more on this." In other words, this chapter once again drove home how badly I wish Kvilhaug had made the effort, or secured the effort of someone else, to better organize and streamline the material in this book. It keeps on making good points and finding worthwhile links between things, but it does so in a scattered, sometimes repetitive way. By this point, I've mostly come to accept this, but I also am feeling more and more acutely "wait, I'm not done with this book yet?"

Tree of Woe has been writing a <a href="https://treeofwoe.substack.com/p/on-strategy">great</a> <a href="https://treeofwoe.substack.com/p/on-strategy-part-ii">series</a> on strategy lately. The second post describes the "OODA Loop," and the implication it has for strategic thinking that quick, decisive action is almost always a strategic advantage in-and-of itself. Despite being long familiar with both the OODA loop and maxims like Patton's "a good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week," I had never put the two together to realize that the OODA loop implies that attitude, so that was a great insight. Still, it reminded me of an insight of my own that came to me moving from the Army into consulting, which is that Patton's preference for violence of action is a heuristic that is situationally, but not universally, helpful. So far, so obvious, right? But it was a little later, when I began reading more about mental models and decision-making that I encountered the key to unlocking when to use that heuristic and when not to: the difference between satisficing and maximizing.

<h3 id="org4f7564b">My Definition of Strategy - Coordinating Efforts to Get Outcomes Under Uncertainty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f7564b">
<p>
In the first article linked above, Tree of Woe has a wonderfully elegant definition of strategy that I really like: "The art of decision-making in conditions of uncertainty." It's short, to the point, and captures the most important bits: making decisions and uncertainty. Many definitions of strategy are crafted for one field (military, political, business, and so forth), and fall down a bit when taken out of that field. This one has the advantage of working well across all fields where you might think of things as "<a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book-strategy-a_history">strategic</a>."
</p>

<p>
Even so, this is a topic near and dear to my heart, so a few years ago, I came up with my own definition. I take its similarity to Tree of Woe's as an indication that I got something right, but I wanted to share it to highlight the differences and why I think they're worth thinking about. So, here's my definition of strategy: "coordinating the efforts of lower-order means to achieve higher-order ends in the face of uncertainty." Notice the common focus on uncertainty (Tree of Woe's first article has a <i>great</i> framework for thinking about different sources of uncertainty) - if you know exactly how things are going to go, it might be hard, but it's planning, not strategy. On the other hand, my definition specifies a little more what kind of decisions are being made, making it a bit narrower, but I think focusing a bit more on "strategic" decision-making versus other kinds.
</p>

<p>
For starters, let's look at the first word: "coordinating." The word "strategy" comes from the ancient Greek <i>Strategos</i>, which means "general [of an army]," and so means "doing the stuff that generals do." Notice it is not doing the stuff that a fire team leader does, or a lieutenant - from the beginning, the word strategy has been applied when a certain amount of complexity is involved in the thing you are making decisions for. I may face uncertainty about what will happen with my finances in the next year, but is it "strategic" to save money? I'd argue not by itself, because it's just me making a decision about my actions. Now, if I'm the CFO of a corporation trying to improve its financial situation for the next year, that <i>is</i> strategic, because I'm coordinating efforts across a large organization.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so strategy is about coordinating, but what are we coordinating? That brings us to our next point: "the efforts of lower-order means to achieve higher-order ends." I'm not thrilled with how wordy this is, but for now, that's the best I can do to get the idea across succinctly. Remember the bit about "doing what a general does?" Not only does that imply a large/complex organization to be coordinated, it also implies a certain "level" of outcome intended. When I decide what route to take to get to work in the morning, I face all kinds of uncertainty, but it would be a bit silly to call that decision "strategic," because the outcome is just whether I'm a few minutes late to work. On the other hand, if I'm deciding what route a patrol should take through enemy territory to successfully blow up a bridge before a crucial supply convoy can get over it, <i>that's</i> strategic, because the outcome has a wider effect than its immediate surroundings. I put this piece into my definition because I wanted a way to meaningfully distinguish between tactics and strategy, which this gives us: tactics are what you do to ensure effects at the same level, strategy is what you do to affect higher-order things. Good tactics will often be informed by the strategic context, like when Lieutenant Winters of <i>Band of Brothers</i> fame took out that German artillery emplacement at <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Br%C3%A9court_Manor_Assault">Brecour Manor</a> - he knew that the artillery hindered units landing at Utah beach from coming inland and establishing a more secure beachhead, and so understood the significance of what he was doing, but all of his decisions that June morning were focused on the immediate goal of defeating the German artillery emplacement.

<h3 id="org96dfa49">Satisficing against Maximizing - Good Enough or As Good as Possible</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org96dfa49">
<p>
So, I thought up the above definition while I was a consultant, and I've been pretty happy with it since. At the same time, I observed that the preference for "violence of action" the Army had drilled into me wasn't <i>always</i> appropriate in the business world. This was maybe easier for me to notice than some others because the preference for violence of action doesn't come especially naturally to me: in strategy games, my favorite tactic is to "turtle" behind a wall of impenetrable defenses until I have overwhelming force. In real life, I like to gather information, ponder, and "wait and see" as much as I can. That being said, I was an airborne infantryman, and there, violence of action is not only expected, it's <i>who you are</i>, so I internalized it pretty well, despite it not coming naturally. This combo allowed me to notice both how useful violence of action can be, but also that there are times where it's not the best way to go. For a long time, this was vague and intuitive - I could recognize when to be aggressive and when to be contemplative, but I couldn't tell you in a general way what was different about those situations.
</p>

<p>
And then I encountered the idea of <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Satisficing">satisficing</a> versus maximizing. We're all familiar with maximizing: it's getting the most of out of a situation that you possibly can. If you want to be an olympic athlete or a rock star, you likely are doing everything to maximize your craft - every extra rep, every tweak to your psychology, every opportunity to test and prove your talent, you're going to take. If you find a good investment, you want to put as much money into that as you can afford, because the more you put in, the more the payoff. Peter Thiel doesn't want to have just a <i>bit</i> of a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#zero-to-one">monopoly</a>, he wants the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
Satisficing, on the other hand, is when there is a certain threshold with which you will have <i>satisfaction</i> (see the link there?), and beyond that doesn't make a big difference. If you want to have a fancy dinner, once you're in Michelin Star territory, you're likely getting something fancy and delicious, and finding a place with a second Star isn't going to be as big a jump up as finding a place with a Star at all. Or if you find a job in a place you want to live that pays enough for your lifestyle and goals, you might just take it instead of spending weeks or months looking for a job that pays a bit more. Many, many situations in life work like this, and once you're consciously aware of it, you can apply it to save time and effort where you might otherwise spin your wheels. My favorite go-to example: have you ever been with a group of friends trying to decide where to order dinner from? Have you ever spent <i>way</i> too long trying to figure this out? Well, satisficing to the rescue: in this situation, your goal is not to <i>maximize</i> food enjoyment, your goal is to <i>satisfy</i> your group's need for a decent meal while you enjoy spending time together. That means that <i>any</i> restaurant that everyone is at least fine with will work. So, when you get into the start of what looks likely to be an endless round of "I dunno, what do you want?" just jump in with "let's get pizza!" If anyone objects, they'll say so, and you can throw out another suggestion. But often, just having a definite choice put out there will get everyone else to say "okay, works for me."
</p>

<p>
The technical difference between when you want to maximize and when you want to satisfice comes down to the expected payoff of the action. Not everything is amenable to being quantified and graphed, of course, but for the sake of clarity, it's helpful to go there for these examples. In situations where there is a linear payoff (I sell one more widget, I get $5 more dollars) or an exponential payoff (going from 3rd to 2nd in marketshare makes me 50% richer, going from 2nd to 1st makes me 150% richer), you want to maximize if you can - more effort brings more payoff, so it makes sense to put in as much effort as you can that isn't held back by other constraints. On the other hand, very many situations have diminishing marginal returns: the first one gives you a huge payoff, the second a decent payoff, the third meh, and so on. Imagine you're starving. The first cheeseburger will literally save your life and likely be the most delicious meal you've ever had. The second cheeseburger might get you to feeling stuffed, which might be a nice contrast. The third will make you sick. These are situations where you want to satisfice - maybe just eat that first cheeseburger and move on with your life.

<h3 id="orga641a75">Applying to the OODA Loop - How Quickly Can You Orient?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga641a75">
<p>
Now we know that some situations call for maximizing, and some for satisficing. It turns out that's the key to what produces the preference for violence of action in the military - almost every military situation has a threshold that must be reached and diminishing marginal returns for doing better than that threshold. If the enemy stops fighting, it doesn't <i>really</i> matter how many more soldiers you kill (okay, it might in the long run, but you see my point). If you take a solid defensible position, it doesn't really matter if it's the <i>best</i> defensible position. Not only are most military situations ones where a satisficing approach brings about good results, much of the uncertainty in military situations is brought about by the enemy's <i>choice</i>. If the opposing general would just stop <i>deciding</i> things, you could easily work out the best approach. But alas, he won't. This means that not only will you get diminishing returns from figuring out the <i>best</i> plan once you've come up with a <i>fine</i> plan, but in the time you spend evaluating options and coming up with the best approach, the other side is <i>changing the game</i>. So, your perfect plan might end up applying to a situation that no longer holds. This is the other reason the military has such a strong preference for violence of action - taking the initiative <i>literally</i> shapes the situation both sides are making decisions about, and it shapes it in a way that is hopefully to your advantage. Put these things together, and it's clear why <i>do something that makes sense</i> has so strongly dominated "figure out the best thing to do."
</p>

<p>
What's interesting is that Boyd's OODA loop provides a way of thinking about this. Briefly, OODA stands for "Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act." Boyd recognized that each phase was dynamic and involved taking in information from the situation and other side, but as it's presented usually, folks way over-simplify. So, observe is about understanding what's happening around you. Orient is judging the significance of those things. Decide is picking a course of action, and Act is taking that course of action. The phase with the most relevance for our discussion is <i>Orient</i>. Working out whether a situation takes maximizing or satisficing is an orienting decision. Likewise, the reason taking the initiative is generally preferred in military situations is that it allows you to shape what's happening, which forces your opponent to <i>orient</i>. So, once again, understanding when "getting the gist of things" orients you well enough versus when you should know all of the ins and outs tells you when to maximize and when to satisfice. Point being, in many situations, going with the <i>satisfice</i> option makes good sense, but overall, it's helpful to notice when you ought to shoot for maximizing.

<p>
I've been looking forward to this <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-secret-of-the-five-rites-in-search-of-a-lost-western-tradition-of-inner-alchemy-john-michael-greer/19645542?ean=9781801520652">book</a> by John Michael Greer coming out for a while, so I'm excited to give it a quick write up. I say quick because it's not really all that long, but it is chock full of good information. Obviously, this book will be most helpful if you're interested in the exercise program of "The Five Rites," but it's also an exceptional introduction to the wild world of late 19th to early 20th century American occultism (and its antecedents elsewhere).

<h3 id="org14f60e6">The Five "Tibetan" Rites - Neither Tibetan, nor Rites, Discuss Amongst Yourselves</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org14f60e6">
<p>
The heart of the book is a set of five calisthenic exercises known as "The Five Rites," though originally billed as the "Five Tibetan Rites." These were <a href="https://templodoyoga.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/the_eye_of_revelation_by_peter_kelder_edited_by_c_witt.pdf">published</a> by Peter Kelder in 1939 as a path to youthful vitality and long life brought over from the mysterious Orient (Tibet, obviously). As you might have guessed, this appears to be entirely made up, and Tibet was selected because it at the time it was even harder to verify what came from there than it was to verify what came from India, or China, or other fashionable centers of ancient wisdom. Sure, two of the Rites very likely made their way into American practice via Hatha Yoga and Sun Salutations (these were different schools at the time), so there was <i>some</i> Eastern origin to some of the exercises, but Greer does a good job of laying out the immediate predecessors to this form of the exercises, and where those likely came from. The short version is that European and American occultists of the late 19th and early 20th century were gleefully experimenting with all kinds of physical and breathing exercises, and at the same time, the little shreds of lore and practice that were coming over from India and the rest of Asia held a lot of cachet. Put these together and American practitioners slapped one Asian label or another on anything that they could. The prolific William Walker Atkinson was an especial fan of this, and it looks like he first published versions of four of the rites in one of his "Indian" branded books (under the pen name "Yogi Ramacharaka"). Kelder's little pamphlet, with the clear fingerprints of its publisher, Harry J. Gardener, all over its writing, took these four exercises, added another exercise likely derived from the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Spiritualism">spiritualist</a> movement, and packaged them as a sequence - something like an American sun salutation. Along the way, via tweaking, experimentation, and variation, these developed into a respectable workout that can be done quickly, taught through the written word (important to the booming occult correspondence course industry at the time), and is compatible with other alternative spiritual pursuits (like doing magic). If you are interested in trying this yourself, see the last section below.

<p>
So, as someone who's been doing the Five Rites off and on for a year or two, the background on where the exercises came from was interesting, but not really earthshaking. On the other hand, the strands Greer traces on the internal/energetic/"woo" side of the Five Rites are utterly fascinating. The investigation serves as an introduction/overview of the occult scene of the late 19th and early 20th century, focusing on America, but with necessary forays into Europe and Asia. So, if you'd like a quick tour of the weird world of alternative spirituality at the turn of the last century, you can do worse than this book.

<h4 id="orge24aa68">A Quick Aside on Subtle Bodies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge24aa68">
<p>
Traditional western alternative spirituality (occultism) teaches that we are more than just our material bodies made of atoms, electricity, and so forth. Different schools of thought split these "subtle" bodies up in different ways, or give a different number of them, but John Michael Greer, whose teachings I currently work with, gives four: material, etheric, astral, and mental. The material body is the one we all know so well - meat, fluids, nerves, headaches, hunger, and so forth. The etheric body is the body of "life force" - a concept that just about every culture except the industrialized West believes in. The etheric body is thought to animate and charge the material body, the difference between a living body and a corpse. When you have lots of energy and feel "alive," your etheric body is healthy and full of etheric "energy." When you feel drained, mopey, hopeless, and lethargic, your etheric body is not in great shape. Sunlight, fresh air, physical exercise, and eating well all help to keep your etheric body in good shape. The astral body is what you experience the imaginary with: day dreams, regular dreams, mental images, sounds, and scents, emotions, and desires. Most the stuff that we have been trained to think of as "in our head" is what our Astral body experiences. Last, we have a "mental sheath," which is our way of experiencing the mental plane, and it is the least developed of our bodies, because humans are the only material animals we know about that experience the mental plane at all. This is how we experience meaning, significance, and understanding. It's hard to describe, because again, we're not very good at it. If you can ever think of a concept you were trying to learn that suddenly "clicked" - it went from a memorized definition to something that actually impacts how you understand the world, that was an experience of your mental body.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, all of these bodies affect each other all the time. To use a crude example, say you imagine someone you find attractive doing sexy things with you (astral). You begin to feel excited and energetic (etheric), and your body responds by becoming aroused (material). If you follow this to where it's likely going, you'll have actively engaged all three of those bodies (far less likely that you'll be using the mental body much to get yourself off). Point is, much of what the Five Rites were aiming to do was not merely to affect the material body, but also the etheric (and to a far lesser extent, the astral).

<h4 id="orgccf5128">Spiritualism and Rosicrucianism Shaped Most of the Background for the Five Rites</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgccf5128">
<p>
The two main threads of the "internal" side of things seem to come from Anton Mesmer on the one hand and Rosicrucian teachings on the other. Anton Mesmer is immortalized in the word "mesmerize," but hypnosis wasn't really his thing, but that of one of his followers. Instead, Mesmer's main focus was on what he called "animal magnetism," which was his name for Qi/Life Force/Prana/Spiritus/etc (see below on the subtle bodies). His teachings were highly influential on the homegrown American movement of Spiritualism mentioned above, and Harry Gardener, the editor/co-writer of <i>The Eye of Revelation</i> had a Spiritualist father and learned their ways early. The most obvious influence on the Five Rites as we have them is the First Rite, which seems clearly descended from Abby Judson's etheric cleansing <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/126779.html">exercise</a>. The Rosicrucian teachings seem to have had a more substantial impact on the Five Rites and the body of practices they grew out of. These included the seven "vortices" the <i>Eye of Revelation</i> talks about (centers in the etheric body), the energy thought to be stimulated by the exercises, and the purported physical and spiritual benefits of doing them. If you're not familiar with either of these traditions, this book will give you a great starting place, along with a good feel for what the occult "scene" was like back in the day.

<h3 id="org441bc30">The Secret Greer Discovered is a Complete Program of Spiritual Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org441bc30">
<p>
The titular "secret" is a set of practices that Greer has reconstructed from the various strands that he discovered went into producing the Five Rites. The Rites themselves form one part of that practice, but it also includes visualization, meditation, and behavioral recommendations (for example, make sure to bathe once daily with tepid water, neither hot nor cold). This seems to be potentially compatible with other spiritual practices, but is best practiced at a different time of day from any others, and might conflict if the other spiritual practices feature a lot of visualization of movement of energy in the subtle bodies. Following these practices is meant to provide a safe, fairly certain path to a similar spiritual awakening to what certain schools of Yoga can produce (like the modern, Westernized flavor of Kundalini Yoga). I just read the book and haven't given it a try, and I'm not sure that I will with my other spiritual practices, so I can't comment on the efficacy, but I trust Greer on such things. The procedure outlined seems more rigorous than a very basic spiritual practice, but not so rigorous as a full-on course of magical study - at its maximum, it seems like you could complete all of the recommended practices in roughly half an hour. So, if that's appealing, consider checking it out!

<h3 id="org17ecc62">My Own Experience with the Five Rites</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org17ecc62">
<p>
I learned about the Five Rites from JMG on one of his sites, likely in a "<a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/tag/magic+monday">Magic Monday</a>" thread, something like, oh, a year and a half, two years ago? For some time I did this daily, but also supplemented with weight lifting and Indian Clubs. When I started noticing numbness in my forearms and hands (and when I started getting busier, if we're being wholly honest here), I cut back on much I was doing from 21 reps every day to 9 reps of each exercise twice a week. Later, I dropped even that very easy standard of practice and did a whole lot of nothing for awhile, the <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/famous-daily-dozen-exercises/">Daily Dozen</a> (which share some William Walker Atkinson DNA with the Five Rites, it turns out!) for a bit, and more nothing for a while. For the last few months, I've gotten back to more-or-less consistently doing the Five Rites, but I'm very slowly working my number of reps back up (I'm at 11, as of today). I say all this so that you can calibrate your reaction to my comments below appropriately.
</p>

<p>
I've never been what you'd call an "enthusiastic exerciser." I like how I <i>feel</i> when I work out regularly, but I have never really gotten to the point that other folks tell me they experience where I actually like working out, or they actively miss it when they skip it. I believe them that this is a thing normal humans experience, but not really me, at least so far. Anyway, one of the things I most like about the Five Rites it that even from this decidedly lazy starting point, the Five Rites are pretty easy to build into a habit. They're quick, they don't require a massive, painful effort like lifting heavy, and they don't get you sucking wind the way a hard run or bike does. In other words, all of the immediately unpleasant things that will leave you feeling better later and in the long run, it minimizes. Instead, the usual state for me to finish a session of the Five Rites is with a slightly elevated heart rate, breathing a bit heavier than usual, and feeling slightly amped, ready for more. This is <i>far</i> more motivating for me than kicking my ass on a Tabata ride on my 80s Aerodyne bike or picking up as much weight as I can without throwing my back out. Also, I tend to feel "energized," in a non-woo, totally physical way after the Five Rites - if I'm tired, it's a pick me up, if I'm unmotivated, I'm ready to tackle some stuff afterward. Physically, I've lost some stubborn weight without trying <i>that</i> hard about my diet, so I'm not complaining there either.
</p>

<p>
I also have not felt as fit and strong from just the Five Rites as I have when I've had a more comprehensive fitness plan. I suspect that to be where I want to be, I <i>do</i> need to have some hard runs or bike rides and some heavy weight lifting, which is too bad for a lazy jerk like me. On the other hand, if I'm trying to maintain, or if I want something I can do every day, even days where I can't "really" work out, the Five Rites are <i>really</i> good, at least for me. At maximum, it takes about 10 minutes to do it, and you end feeling jazzed rather than wiped. You can even do them in formal-ish clothes in the office, if you have some fairly private space. So, setting aside completely any esoteric benefits, I'm a pretty big fan of the Five Rites as daily "baseline" exercise routine, but as always, what works for me might not be so hot for you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org28b1e7d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org28b1e7d">How to Get Started</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org28b1e7d">
<p>
Alright, so maybe now you're saying "I want to give this a shot!" Below I give my description of the five exercises. You can also follow the link above to the original pamphlet with its full instructions. The book recommends starting with three repetitions of each, and adding 2 more repetitions once that becomes easy (after about a week, minimum). Once you get to 21 reps, that's it, don't add any more. If you've been doing 21 reps of each exercise for awhile and feel good, you can add a second session (say, one in the morning, and another in the evening). If you do this, start over again at 3 reps for the second session, and build up 2 reps at a time, week by week, until you get to 21. Add repetitions at the rate of your <i>worst</i> exercise - if you can do 9 of four of the rites easily, but one of them is still a struggle, don't add any more repetitions yet - wait until that last rite is easy too. Do each repetition slow and steady, don't rush or try to "bang it out." I do three long, slow breaths between each exercise.
</p>

<p>
If you're a generally fit person, this may sound <i>way</i> too easy, but trust me, it's worth taking it slow. For one, these exercises make a lot of use of fiddly little stabilizer muscles, especially in your core. If you go hard to start with, you're asking to pull or strain one of those, which is not only no fun, it will also keep you from doing these or other exercises for a while. Secondly, remember that bit about internal alchemy above? Well, that means that these exercises are meant to stimulate systems in your body, including your endocrine glands (and that's not even touching the possible effects on your non-physical subtle bodies, if you go in for that stuff). If you do too much too fast, you can over-stimulate these glands and end up with some weird and unpleasant results.
</p>

<p>
Basically, if you start doing the Five Rites and you feel like you're not getting enough of a workout, instead of pushing your progress with the Rites, go do something else in addition - pull ups, lifting weights, going for a run, whatever works.
</p>

<h4 id="org905109d">The First Rite</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org905109d">
<p>
Stand with your arms held out to your sides, parallel to the ground (forming a 'T' with your body). Spin in a circle, going clockwise (imagine a clock on the floor under you, spin in the direction the hands would turn). No need to do this too quickly - if you find yourself more than a little dizzy, slow it down.

<h4 id="org9dff180">The Second Rite</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9dff180">
<p>
Lay on the floor (preferably on something like a mat or rug that gives a bit of cushion and insulation) with your hands flat on the floor next to your hips. For each repetition, keeping your legs straight, raise both feet together until they are straight up in the air, simultaneously lifting your head and shoulders to compress your belly. Lower your legs and head back to the floor to complete one repetition.

<h4 id="org77b2895">The Third Rite</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org77b2895">
<p>
If you do any yoga, this is basically Camel Pose. Kneel on your knees, but with your thighs straight up an down (your butt should not be resting on anything), the tops of your feet on the floor,  with your hands at your sides, and let your chin dip slightly, to relax your neck and upper back, but otherwise keep a fairly upright posture. To do a repetition, lean your head back and let your spine bend backwards, with your arms hanging back free. I find I get the best results if I focus less on bending my back and more on opening my chest. To complete a repetition, come back up to upright, and again, let your chin hand down a bit to relax your neck and upper back.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf0cf061" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf0cf061">The Fourth Rite</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf0cf061">
<p>
Sit with your legs together and extended in front of you, with your hands on the floor to either side of your hips. Again, it seems to be helpful to let your chin dip a bit to relax the neck and upper back in this position. Lift up your hips, letting your feet go flat on the floor, forming a "table" out of your trunk and thighs, with hands and feet flat on the floor. Don't arch your back like a gymnastic bridge, and don't throw your head too far back. I find it helpful to do this slowly and deliberately, minimizing any "pop" into position. Return to the seated position and remember to relax the neck/upper back before the next repetition. I also find it helpful to "unload" my arms in this position - let the elbows and shoulders relax and stop putting any weight on the hands.
</p>

<p>
If you do a lot of repetitive work with your hands (like typing), you might find yourself getting some weird numbness on the under/outside of your forearms and hands once you start doing a lot of repetitions of this. Taking it slow in introducing repetitions and relaxing the neck and arms in the starting positions as I've recommended will help, but you might also want to introduce some shoulder extension stretches before/after the Five Rites. To do these, sit on the floor with legs relaxed (feet on floor, knees bent) and put your arms behind you, palms flat, fingers pointing away from your body. Move your hands until your pinkies touch and crawl them as far away from you as you can. Then, pick up your butt and move it away from your hands before putting it back on the floor. Repeat until you feel a strong, but not painful, stretch in the inside of your elbows. Hold for 30 seconds or a minute, or as long as feels good to you. You can also stretch your wrists by getting on your hands and knees, fingers facing forward, then lean as far forward as you can, until you feel a stretch in your wrist. Hold for 30 seconds to a minute. Then, rotate your hands so your fingers are facing in toward you, heels of your hand facing out, thumbs on the outside. Then sit back on your heels as far as you can comfortably, and feel the stretch in your wrists. Hold for 30 seconds to a minute. When I've added these stretches, I've gotten rid of any numbness in my forearms and hands that I might have been feeling from some combination of work and the Five Rites.

Again, if you do Yoga, this will be familiar. It's basically a Downward Dog into an Upward Dog, or what you might have heard called a "Hindu Push Up" in certain workout spaces. Start on your hands and knees and then lift up your hips and straighten your legs, leaving yourself with hands and toes flat on the ground and your butt as your highest point. Try to keep your spine straight, feeling the stretch in your legs. To begin, you likely won't be able to flatten your feet, but as you do more of this, you might be able to get your heels down to the floor without compromising your spinal posture. From this position, lower your hips and lift up your head, now arching your back and looking as far up/back as you can, keeping your arms straight. Allow your feet to roll over to where the top of your foot is on the floor instead of the bottoms of your toes.

<h4 id="org1fc64dc">Optional - Grounding and Follow Up</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1fc64dc">
<p>
You can do the five exercises above with no "woo" whatsoever and get good results. You won't get super jacked or anything, but you'll develop decent core strength and flexibility, and it tends to have a great effect on energy. I've also shed the last 5 or 10 pounds that have been dogging me for years since I've started doing these at least semi-regularly (your mileage may, of course, vary). All that being said, one simple addition I have found helpful was suggested by another commenter over on JMG's <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org">dreamwidth</a>: "grounding," which apparently comes from Qi Gong practice. After completing your full set, stand with your feet hip-to-shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent, comfortably settled and solid. Place your hands on your belly, an inch or two under your belly button, with your elbows out at your sides (I form a little diamond with my thumbs and forefingers). Breath in deeply through your nose then slowly out of pursed lips. While you do this, put as much of your attention on your belly and trunk as you can, trying to center your awareness there. Do this for a couple of minutes or until you feel "settled" or "grounded." I also find it helpful to follow Kelder's advice and avoid cold drinks, showers, or other exposure to strong cold for a while after finishing the Rites. Given the endocrine stimulation, you might also want to avoid strong caffeine drinks immediately after, or you might feel a bit jitterry.

This chapter was not quite as coherent as I might have hoped. As you might expect, this chapter draws together a lot of the threads Kvilhaug has talked about in previous chapters, but unfortunately, it's not as much of a culmination of those threads as I'd like to see. That's long been one of the most interesting things about the Norse lore - there's a clear narrative arc to it, even in the raw form of the poems given in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. Loki's tricks grow more and more spiteful, more often hurting than helping the other gods. Baldr is killed, Loki is bound, and we pass into tales of human heroes and valkyries rather than gods and goddesses. Things are <i>building</i>, and what they are building to is Ragnarok. Folks argue about whether Ragnarok is just a re-skinned Christian apocalypse, or to what degree Abrahamic eschatology influenced whatever tales might have been there, but to me, it seems integral to the heathen worldview - it's baked in right there at <i>Voluspa</i>, it's referenced throughout the Eddic poems, and it presents neither a satisfying "good guys win, bad guys lose" narrative, nor a true "ending" at all, but rather a complicated, nuanced destruction and rebirth. I think there's much to learn here, and Kvilhaug helps us to suss out some of what that might be.
</p>

<h3 id="org8a4287a">Do You Want an Apocalypse? Because This Is How We Get Apocalypses</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8a4287a">
<p>
One of the most interesting parts of the narrative that leads up to Ragnarok is how the gods seemingly lay the foundation for this doom of their own doing. To get the wall built around Asgard, they break their oath to the giant craftsman. To avenge Baldr's death, kin kills kin. At one time or another, the gods break <i>all</i> of the inviolable rules that they are the very guarantors of - oathbreaking, kinslaying, rape, murder, and so forth. In each case, it seems to be <i>needed</i>, it seems to be <i>justified</i>, and yet, it is still, in some sense, crooked. Maybe the only way to chain Fenris was for Tyr to pledge His hand as collateral that they weren't <i>really</i> tying Him up. Maybe the only way to make things right after Baldr was killed was for Hodhr to be killed, and maybe only another son of Odhinn could do it. The point is that whatever the reason, however good it was, breaking the fundamental laws of the cosmos makes the cosmos less stable. Those laws are meant to be inviolable for a reason - violating them makes them harder to uphold, and they're load-bearing elements of reality. Kvilhaug makes the good point that it is likely overly simplistic to read the tales of Ragnarok literally as "this is what's going to happen to the physical sphere of rock and sea and magma that you live on," and that it is more likely <i>mostly</i> about a/the <i>spiritual</i> apocalypse - whether on an individual level or societal. I agree that this is likely a far more productive way of looking at things, and gives a nice lens for the less-than-admirable deeds of the gods that help lead to Ragnarok: we each of us do the best we can, but compromises and tradeoffs are made, and maybe even for the best, but they lay the groundwork for what will get us down the line.

<h3 id="org0e3a936">Kvilhaug's Main Trinity: Mind, Passion, and Spirit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e3a936">
<p>
So, as we've heard before, Kvilhaug sees many of the male god trinities that show up in Norse myth as variations of the trio of "Mind, Passion, and Spirit." No surprise, she sees this all over the Ragnarok myth as well. Her basic idea is that a lot of myths are about how Mind and Passion, if left to their own devices, are dangerous and liable to abuse, but that they can be harmoniously managed when Spirit is present and put in charge. Two insights I found especially helpful here: 1. These trinities often also have a key interaction with a goddess of fate and/or a dark ogress, with the right relation being a harmonious marriage of Spirit to that goddess, and 2. in stories where two brothers or friends are given, it can be helpful to see them as Mind and Passion, and the third figure who reconciles or otherwise makes them harmonious as Spirit.

<h3 id="org92b8dbf">Initiation as the Cure for the End Times</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92b8dbf">
<p>
Building on the insight that Ragnarok might best be understood in a spiritual, rather than documentary, sense is the thought that the "answer" to Ragnarok is initiation. This comes across most clearly in <i>Hynluljodh</i>, where Freyja's favorite Ottar has his seeking and gaining of initiatory knowledge marred by repeated references to these fiery and chaotic end times. Freyja stands firm in asserting that the precious mead and the help of the gods will see him through all of that. If Ragnarok is as much about a spiritual or personal dissolution and descent into chaos as it is about the physical world literally coming to an end, it makes sense that having found the kind of knowledge that will allow you to transcend greed and fear and death will let you ride out that catastrophe. In some sense, this is even more hopeful than the "mere" promise that initiation will allow someone to overcome the cycle of oblivion in death and rebirth into the non-heroic human condition.

<h3 id="orgd0b7725">The World After the End</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0b7725">
<p>
Though much weight is often put on the finality of Ragnarok, every mention of it we have also talks about the renewal that will come after. Some folks have said this is a Christian softening of the harsh end of all things, even the gods, that the dour northmen foresaw, but I don't find this argument all that compelling. The renewal after Ragnarok is not presented as the advent of some singular messianic figure, nor is it inconsistent with a cyclical view of the cosmos. In fact, one of the most interesting things about the renewal after Ragnarok is the idea that some of the awfulness that led to Ragnarok, most of all the killing of Baldr and the vengeance on Hodhr for doing so, might have somehow been necessary for the rebirth that follows. If the myths leading up to Ragnarok spell out the inevitable compromises and corruptions that lead to things falling apart, these myths tell of the promise that things could be better, but only with the right changes in human consciousness and conditions. Kvilhaug brings in her idea of trinities by saying that Baldr is the new representative of Spirit, whereas His brothers Vali and Hodhr, now cleansed of their negative feelings and short-sightedness, are Mind and Passion. She also introduces some interesting numerological speculation that I'll have to look into more closely as I dive deeper into these myths.

This chapter shows Kvilhaug going along with some of her best and worst tendencies. On the downside, she tries to tie some of the myths to historical events, but does so on the basis of shallow and outdated understandings. More positively, this chapter has a clear theme, and all of her analysis is through that lens and comes back to it, such that even when I think some of the myths cited are a <i>bit</i> of a stretch to bring up when discussing golden ages and their loss, they are at least clearly related to the other things she discusses in the chapter, and the far-flung references to other works has a focus that makes them more comprehensible. I'm also glad to be writing up this chapter because it's our last really long chapter before the final one, clocking in at 74 pages. From here on out, other than the last chapter, none are longer than about half that, which makes getting these reviews out on a regular basis much easier!

<h3 id="org3f48532">Historical Golden Ages (Didn't Really Happen)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f48532">
<p>
Kvilhaug opens the chapter with some more speculation about what historical events might be reflected in the myths, and again, it comes across as some of her weaker stuff. As I might have mentioned in a previous chapter, at the time of writing, Kvilhaug seems to have fully bought Marija Gimbutas's theory that Europe had a mostly-peaceful matriarchal culture before the mean patriarchal Indo-Europeans rolled up and took over. For an excellent discussion of how Gimbutas was light years ahead of her field in working out where the Indo-Europeans came from, but totally wrong about what they displaced, check out this <a href="https://librarianofcelaeno.substack.com/p/maria-gimbutas">great post</a>. For a <i>very</i> thorough take on what we know about Europe for the past 12,000 years or so, <a href="https://nemets.substack.com/p/seven-ages-of-western-eurasia">this</a> makes a great overview. Anyway, the point is, the folks who settled Europe before the Indo-Europeans likely weren't all that peaceful or all that matriarchal either. It's possible their religion(s) gave greater weight to female deities than the Indo-European ones, based on the amount of female statuary, but we really don't know. There likely <i>are</i> some echoes of this and/or earlier meetings between the Indo-Europeans and neighboring peoples found in mythology and historicized mythology of the various Indo-European peoples (like the Aesir-Vanir War, the Rape of the Sabine Women, and so forth), but note that <i>none</i> of these stories are associated with a golden age that got wrecked - they're all associated with different groups of people and/or divine beings having a war and eventually settling it with a truce that united them and established much of how society was ordered. Anyway, the point of all this is that I think it's generally not that helpful to try to find the "real" golden age behind a golden age myth. The idea that things used to be better, and now we live in a crappier world is <i>very</i> common mythologically, and likely has as much to do with individuals aging and normal civilizational decay as it does with accurate historical memories.

<p>
Kvilhaug also engages in one of her other less-than-helpful tendencies in this chapter when she starts talking about the influence of Christianity and its own story of a lost "golden age" in Eden (spoiler alert - it's all bad). Did you realize that it's standard Christian teaching that the Fall was <i>only</i> about sex? Me neither, because no one serious actually thinks or teaches that. Maybe that's the version that gets trotted out by lukewarm Norwegian mostly-secular Christians trying to check a few religious boxes or something, but it was yet another occasion where Kvilhaug seems to attack a caricature of Christianity rather than engaging with the very many ways you can respect what the religion is doing without agreeing with it. It's also a bit muddled why she even brings up Eden here - she doesn't make a very strong case that the "lost golden age" Norse myths are late, Christian-influenced stories that are just retelling the Eden myth, nor does she especially say that the Golden Age myths were cast in a grossly deceptive light by being written down by Christians shaped by ideas of Eden and original sin. There's a lot of complicated and potentially useful stuff to sort through in the role of Christianity in shaping or influencing the lore that we have, since all of the written versions passed through Christian hands to get to us, even if they were composed in a heathen age. Instead, she just seems to sort of vaguely be talking about how different religions and cultures have "golden age" myths, but the Norse ones are better than the Christian one, because Christianity is bad and hates sex. Or something. It's not a great look, and it doesn't add much to the chapter.

<h3 id="org0a7b643">Frodhi and His Millstone is Definitely A Golden Age Myth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a7b643">
<p>
Okay, the first Norse myth discussed is definitely a golden age myth. King Frodhi ("Wise") presided over an age so peaceful and prosperous that a maiden could walk unescorted the breadth of the country without being troubled and a gold ring could lie right there out in the open without anyone picking it up. He achieved this through a wondrous mill that could grind out whatever you wanted, turned by two giantesses - Fenja (usually translated as "of the heath," but Kvilhaug prefers "the Achiever") and Menja (usually translated as "of the Necklace," maybe associated with Freyja's famous <i>Brisingamen</i>, but again, Kvilhaug has her own preference, here for "the Rememberer"). From her preferred translations, and the fact that turning this mill cranks out what happens in the world, Kvilhaug equates the giantesses with Urdhr and Verdhandi. At any rate, at some point, Frodhi grows greedy and has the giantesses grind out gold, and he goes to sleep and orders them to keep going without rest. As they grow resentful at their mistreatment, they grind out all kinds of bad stuff, and the golden age ends. Kvilhaug argues, and I think with good support, that the point here is that as long as wisdom is in charge, primal forces can be turned to good ends, but if we lose wisdom, those primal forces cause all kinds of hardship and bad news. This is a clear myth of "you had a good thing going and screwed it up, and now everything sucks," so it's a good place to start a discussion of golden ages and their loss.

<h3 id="org20639e2">Chaining Fenris is a Bit Shakier as  'Golden Age' Myth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org20639e2">
<p>
Okay, so next up Kvilhaug talks about the myth of chaining Fenris. While much of her analysis is helpful, I think including this myth in a chapter on "golden ages" is a bit shaky. Her standpoint is that up to this point, things seem to have gone pretty well for the Aesir, but then Loki's kids show up and seem to introduce/embody problems. Fenris's name most likely means "greed," which is not shocking, as wolves are often associated with greed/hunger in Norse myth, so <i>the</i> wolf very likely is as well. Kvilhaug's take is that Tyr represents war, and that he loses his hand to Greed, because war too easily escalates due to greed, at great cost. I think there's some merit to this, but my own meditations have led me to believe that Tyr, as the God of organized, societally-sanctioned war, losing his hand to the wolf is the <i>cost</i> of war - you feed some of your young to the wolf, and they never become men, householders, because the tribe/city/society <i>needed</i> to pay that cost, or at least thought it did. Anyhow, there's lots more here to meditate on - the wolf is bound by seemingly insubstantial things, Tyr is the God of keeping oaths and he essentially offers a false guarantee, Fenris is not dangerous <i>yet</i>, but we know He kills Odhinn at Ragnarok - there's a lot of useful, interesting stuff happening here, but I'm not sure how much of it is usefully analyzed as "right after" the presumably idyllic age described in other poems.

<h3 id="org9b1c36a">Kvasir's Readily Available Wisdom is Another Clear Golden Age</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b1c36a">
<p>
When we get to Kvasir, though, we're again clearly dealing with a time when things were good and then someone went and messed it up by getting greedy. We have two different versions of where Kvasir came from, oddly enough both from sources written by Snorri - in the <i>Ynglinga Saga</i>, he is simply one of the Vanir hostages given to the Aesir as part of the peace deal to end their war. The version given in the <i>Prose Edda</i> is more interesting, though. At the end of the Aesir-Vanir war, both sides came together to seal the peace deal in various ways  including the hostage exchange given in the other version (though with slightly different hostages), but one of those ways is a bit funky. All of the Aesir and Vanir spit into the same vat, mix that spit with some berries, and from this divine mush form Kvasir, who proves to be the wisest man in the whole world (presumably because he partakes of the wisdom of all of the other divine beings). Kvasir wanders the world, giving out his wisdom to anyone who wants it, for free even! But then a couple of dwarves, Fjalar and Galar, whose names probably have something to do with noise and/or yelling (like many of the primeval giants we've encountered before), have the bright idea that instead of just having Kvasir over for a beer and asking him whatever they want to know, they should instead <i>kill him</i>, drain his blood, and use it to brew some mead that will grant eloquence and wisdom to whoever drinks it. Cool plan, guys. So, they do it, and they put the mead in three containers: <i>Son</i> (maybe "blood," or maybe "reconciliation"), <i>Bodhn</i> ("Vessel/Container"), and <i>Odhroerir</i> ("Stirrer of <i>Odhr,</i>" <i>odhr</i> is something like inspiration or the ecstatic state, it's the root of <i>Odhin's</i> name, he is "The <i>odhr</i> master.") Continuing to be complete psychos, these dwarves next invite over a giant, Gilling, and his wife, take Gilling on a nice boat ride, and then tip over the boat to drown him. Coming back on shore, his wife is understandably upset, starts wailing, and these guys are apparently less of a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBGOQ7SsJrw">lamentations</a> than Conan, so they kill her too. Unfortunately for them, their son <i>Suttung</i> ("Heavy with Drink") hears about this, rolls up on the murderous dwarves, and puts them out on a reef that gets covered at high tide. With the water creeping higher and higher, the dwarves offer him something, anything to save their lives, and he's all "well, whatcha got?" Water up to their necks, they offer him the mead in a panic, and he's like, "yeah, okay, that'll work." Snorri says that they were thus reconciled, but I like to think of Suttung as just letting them drown anyway.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Suttung hides the mead in <i>Hnitbjorg</i> ("The Clashing Mountain" is the usual translation, maybe like the cliffs that smash together that the Argonauts had to get through), and sets his daughter <i>Gunnlodh</i> ("Invitation to Battle") to watch over the mead. At this point, we're pretty clearly out of the golden age of Kvasir going around being a bro to all and sundry, as his wisdom is now locked up under a magic mountain and guarded by a giant family. What's interesting about this myth, though, is that it's not <i>only</i> about the golden age and its loss, but also about its (partial) restitution. Odhin decides to go get the Mead, and so he spends a summer mowing hay for Suttung's brother (after tricking his previous thralls into killing themselves with a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">whetstone</a>), and then the brother agrees to help him get the mead, first by asking Suttung (no go), then by drilling a hole in the mountain for Odin to <i>literally</i> snake his way in, but I guess he feels bad about screwing over his brother or something, because he tries to trick Odin, first by not drilling all the way through, and then by straight up trying to go all <i>Saw</i> on him with the drill, but Odin gets into the mountain anyway. Gunnlodh likes the looks of Odin and agrees to give him a taste of the mead if he'll spend three nights with her (in the version referenced in <i>Havamal</i>, there's an implication that Odin swore an oath to her, maybe a marriage oath, but that's not in the <i>Prose Edda</i> version). When she goes to give him three sips, he uses one big sip per container and ends up with all of the mead inside him! He turns into an eagle and hightails it back to Asgard, but Suttung spots him, turns into an eagle himself and takes off in hot pursuit (hmmm, another <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_4_retrieving_the_soul_of_the_gods">giant-turned-eagle chase</a>). We don't here what happened to Suttung, or if Odin just lost him, or what, but along the way, Odin leaked out some of the mead (from which end it came out will depend on how you interpret the passage), and this nasty, second-rate mead is where crappy poetry comes from. The good stuff, though, Odin spits out into three containers in Asgard, and it becomes available to those he chooses to grace with it, granting poetic fluency, which is also wisdom and memory and inspiration and all that.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug's take on this myth sequence is, surprise, that some of the figures are actually the same as Gods/Giants from other stories! She equates Suttung with her favorite giant, Aegir (which is <i>slightly</i> weird, as the primary source for most of this story is a section of <i>Skalkskaparmal</i> being told <i>to Aegir</i>, but hey). She points to the association with mead, being the father of the Maiden with the Mead, and so forth. More interesting to me is her assertion that Kvasir might be another name for Heimdall, which at first struck me as totally out of left field, but she presents some interesting evidence. First, in <i>Thrymskvidha</i>, stanza 15, Heimdall is called one of the Vanir and said to possess great wisdom, and though He isn't mentioned in any of the stories about the hostage exchange, He is seen living and acting amongst the Aesir, implying he might have been one of the hostages. Secondly, and more interestingly, in <i>Gudhrunarkvidha onnur</i>, stanza 23, the "precious mead" is said to be imbued with/made to grow by "the power of earth," "the cool cold sea," and "the Blood of Reconciliation/Atonement," and in <i>Hyndluljodh,</i> stanza 38, Heimdall is said to be imbued with/made to grow by "the power of earth," "the cool cold sea," and "the blood of reconciliation/atonement" - now isn't <i>that</i> something? I wouldn't say it's open and shut, especially since Kvilhaug reads a lot into Heimdall that others don't (she translates His name "Great World," and sees Him as the personification of all of Being), but at a minimum, it's awfully rich food for bethinking (meditating) on.

<h3 id="org7e4134f">Baldr's Murder Mystery is a Compelling Way to Read the Myth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7e4134f">
<p>
Though it might be a bit cutesy, Kvilhaug approaches the myth of Baldr's death as a murder mystery, which turns out to actually be pretty compelling. Now, this is another myth where the "golden age" is not so much spelled out as implied - since Baldr is so extraordinarily great, things must have been great when he was around. It seems  bit shaky to me, but again, it doesn't much take away from the analysis of this myth, just the broader theme Kvilhaug is trying to demonstrate with a bunch of "Golden Age" stories (this is the last time I'm going to hammer on this, because I think that the myths of Kvasir and Frodhi are likely the only ones that are <i>really</i> golden age myths). Anyhow, so the point is, the story of Baldr seems fairly straightforward: Baldr has some bad dreams about dying, everyone freaks out, his mom, the queen of the gods, goes around and gets everything^* to swear an oath not to harm Him, so everything's good. The gods, being rowdy viking gods, celebrate this by hurling weapons at Baldr and finding it awesomely hilarious when nothing happens. Loki sees all this and hates it, and wonders if it's <i>really</i> as foolproof as it seems. So He turns into a woman, goes to visit Frigg, and asks her if she really got an oath from <i>everything</i>, and she admits, well, no, the mistletoe seemed too small and harmless, so I didn't ask it. Meanwhile, blind Hodh doesn't get to play the reindeer games, and Loki finds him sitting sadly on the sidelines. Loki says he'll be a pal and help Hodh shoot a dart, and he has just the one. Well, surprise, the dart is mistletoe, and now Hodh has killed the most beloved god, and Loki has bounced.
</p>

<p>
Even from this short telling, you can see that whose "fault" it might be is a bit tangled. Loki had the intent, secured the murder weapon, and even guided Hodh's hand. On the other hand, Hodh is the one who let the dart fly. Where things start getting even <i>weirder</i>, though, is when you consider that Odhin, the god who has sought out the most hidden wisdom, went and consulted a ghost volva about Baldr's dreams, and then as Baldr lies dead on his funeral pyre, Odhin whispers a secret in his ear. And, oh, also, later, after Ragnarok, you know, that thing that Odhin is more concerned about than anything and that will kill Him? Yeah, after that, Baldr <i>comes back</i> to the reborn world. So maybe the Crafty One knew what was coming and had some role in it. But wait, it gets even trickier! Frigg, the (extremely )protective mother can even be considered a suspect! In the <i>Lokasenna</i> (basically Loki trash-talking all of the other gods), Loki brags to Frigg that he got Her beloved son killed. Another Goddess, trying to calm things down (everybody tries, Loki keeps escalating, until eventually Thor shows up and threatens Him enough that He leaves), responds by saying that Frigg sometimes sits on Odhin's high throne, the Hlidhskjalf, and can see just as far and clearly as Him, and further, that She knows all fate, but speaks it not. What a strange juxtaposition! And remember, it was Frigg who so "carelessly" revealed the only thing that could kill Baldr, after going to all of that work to protect him. All of this points to the idea that Baldr's death might <i>not</i> have been the (only) the awful tragedy it is usually presented as, but a necessary step in the eventual preservation and rejuvenation of the world.
</p>

<p>
Where Kvilhaug mostly gets the "golden age" vibe from this myth is in translating the names. She gives Baldr's name as "Bold" (one of a few credible etymologies that many other scholars also buy), and so sees Him as the embodiment of courage. His wife Nanna Neprsdottir's name she translates as "Understanding, daughter of the Ring," and for this story at least, she translates the <i>odhr</i> in Odhin's name as "Spirit" and Frigg's name as "Love" (it is definitely related to the word "Love," but it's a title that came to mean "Lady," and most translations render it "Beloved"). His home, <i>Breidablik</i>, she translates as "Broad Vision." In other words, Baldr is the kind of courage you get from deep understanding and broad vision, and as long as that courage is nurtured and respected, it is a source of happiness, and is in fact quite resilient. Kvilhaug translates <i>Hodhr</i> as "Strife" or "Aggression," which is apparently a bit more speculative than some of the other names. If we go with it, though, that means that this understanding, loving, fair courage can be disrupted by "blind strife" or "blind aggression" - just as we see hatred and greed as negative qualities that heroes have to surpass to earn a valkyrie bride. As usual, I think that Kvilhaug comes off as a little too sure she has the one and only answer to the "puzzle" of the myth, but I do think that this particular proposed "solution" is incredibly fruitful and will help cast light on a lot of other linked myths.

<h3 id="org70ea31b">Baldr, the Sequel: Vali's Ugly Conception</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org70ea31b">
<p>
This is not quite its own tale, and it certainly isn't about the loss of a golden age, but more what is done after it. It's also weird because it's a rather ugly tale, and our most complete version of it comes from Saxo Grammaticus, who had a far more hostile take on his heathen ancestors than Snorri did, and whose euhemerized tellings of mythic stories often show the god-substitute characters in very poor lights. We can't totally toss these stories out, though, because there are hints and snippets in the authentically heathen lore, like the Eddic and Skaldic poems, that point to some of these same stories. All of which is to say that this myth is on even shakier ground as something that was known and believed by heathens back in the day, and so any religious thinking informed by it should take that into account.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so Baldr has been killed, technically by Hodh, so now Hodh owes a blood debt to Baldr's kin, and Baldr's kin have an obligation to hunt down Hodh until and and unless he comes up with a suitable wergild ("man-gold" - the price paid to the kin of someone killed, which was the civilized answer to endless tit-for-tat blood feuds, Hatfield and McCoy style). When Odhin consulted with the dead seeress about Baldr's seemingly unavoidable death, he asked about vengeance, and he was told he would have to father a new son on a woman/giantess named Rind (Kvilhaug translates as "The Rejecter"). That son will be named Vali, which Kvilhaug links with the same word in Valholl ("Hall of the Chosen"), and so translates as "The Choice." We know that Rind was Vali's mother, and that Vali succeeds in avenging Baldr, and that He is another of the Gods who will survive Ragnarok and be a part of the new order afterward. But pretty much all we know about Rind, or the circumstances of Odhin fathering Vali on her, come from Saxo's telling, which is, well, not very nice. Odhin heads to Rind's folk (here given as Ruthenians, roughly Ukrainian/Polish, which might stand for "foreign, but known to us," which might indicate giants in the non-euhemerized version of the myth Saxo was building on), and he makes his suit, offering first his own greatness, and then when that fails, money. Rind turns him down and says he's too old. He then strikes her with a thorn that makes her fall ill and mad/confused. Odhin changes himself into a healer woman and comes to help. He tells her attendants that she'll have to take some medicine that is so bitter, she'll try to toss it away, so they have to tie her down. And, uh, leave them alone to administer the medicine, of course. With the poor girl tied down, Odhin rapes her and impregnates her with Vali.
</p>

<p>
As I said, an ugly story with a weirdly mixed provenance. Kvilhaug does a good job of laying out some reasons that this distasteful detail may have been part of actual heathen myths and not just a slander thought up by Saxo, and then proceeds to interpret it in the way she has been doing with all the other myths so far. Her take is that "Spirit" (remember, a tricky, fuzzy concept, <i>odhr</i>, that has connotations of altered states of consciousness, ecstasis, and frenzy) can come upon even the most arduous rejecter of things spiritual and create the choice to act bravely and wisely in the world. I'm not sure I wholly buy her take, but it's not unreasonable, and if we accept that in myth, one way of looking at sexual union and its products is as a metaphor for forces/concepts/archetypes coming together and creating an outcome, then whether that coming together was consensual or one-sided might have further metaphoric import. I'm reminded of the myth of the conception of Erechtheus, the first king of the Athenians. Hephaestus tried to force Himself on Athena, but by the time He caught Her, He was too worked up and spilled His seed on Her thigh. She wiped this off, and threw it on the ground, and from the ground sprung the baby Erechtheus. I'll save getting into the specifics (though Neal Stephenson does a nice job in a scene in <i>Cryptonomicon</i>), but the point is that it was important mythically for Erechtheus to, in some sense, be the son of Hephaestus and Athena and the Earth (at the site of Athens, specifically). It was also important, mythically, for Athena to remain a virgin, and for Hephaestus's unlooked-for yearning to be the driving force. The myth rather neatly conveys all of this in a vivid, easy-to-understand way. So maybe the story of Odhin and Rind is pulling some similar conceptual freight - but I haven't worked it out yet.

<h3 id="orgb4e3025">Volund's Teeny Tiny Golden Age</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb4e3025">
<p>
Okay, I said I wouldn't hammer on "was it <i>really</i> a golden age?" anymore, so I'll just point out that what Kvilhaug identifies as a golden age in the story of Volund is nine years of three couples being happily married - so a fairly short, and fairly domestic golden age, but perhaps there's some useful wisdom in contemplating "golden ages" from such a standpoint, after all. Volund is the figure known throughout the Germanic world by various names: Velent, Wieland, Veland, and in English, Wayland the Smith. This section was actually one of the most useful for me in the chapter, as Kvilhaug brings in sources from outside the Eddas and makes some comparisons/equations that are very thought-provoking, if nothing else. For example, in a late Danish medieval version of the story, Velent goes to learn smithing from Mimir, who is a "Hun." As we saw with the Ruthenians above, foreign folks, especially to the east, often seem to stand in for giants in later versions of tales that were de-mythologized. Kvilhaug's etymology for Volund looks straightforward as she presents it, and it has interesting implications if right, but apparently most scholars regard the etymology of the name as obscure and hard to figure out, so her very straightforward reading might be missing something (or maybe the scholars are looking for too complicated an answer!). Anyhow, she takes the first part from <i>Ve</i>, meaning "sacred enclosure," which is not as crazy as it might look at first from my writing, because the "o" in Volund has an umlaut, and so is closer to an "e" than it first appears, and she says the second is just <i>lundr</i> meaning "Grove."
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of interesting stuff going on in the various versions of the Germanic smith legends, often involving dwarves, betrayal, intentional laming, child murder, and worse (yes, worse). I'm not going to give a pithy summary, because this is one of the tales I don't even know as well in the Edda version as others we've covered, and I certainly don't know the other versions and references and such. Instead, I'll focus on what I think are the potentially most interesting, but also most speculative, parts of Kvilhaug's analysis. First, Volund is presented with two brothers. She equates this triad with Odhin-Vili-Ve (there's that "Ve" again!), the three brothers who killed Ymir and made the world, and/or with Odhin, Hoenir, Lodhur, who made the first men, and since she's all about the fluid identity of gods, she sees all of these triads as three-part manifestations of Odhin (which is not such a crazy interpretation - even staid, non-pantheist harder polytheist types often see <i>at least</i> the first three as all manifestations of Odhin). She compares their actions setting up a nice, cozy homestead in a valley by a lake with the acts of primal creation described in earlier myths. Now, here's where it gets even more interesting, potentially. The three brothers find three valkyries bathing at the lake and make them their wives (from how the story goes, it seems like They were into it, just not as much as the dudes). The live together happily for nine years, and then the women are like "valkyries gotta valkyrie," and go off to fight battles and choose warriors and stuff. Two of the brothers go after them, but Volund stays and just starts making gold rings every day. Anyway, what's interesting about Kvilhaug's analysis here is that she equates the three valkyries with the three Norns - Urdhr, Verdhandi, and Skuld. She then proceeds to match each valkyrie (based on the name) with each Norn. Now that each of the brothers has been identified with an aspect of Odhin/one of His brothers and each of the valkyries identified with one of the Norns, we see Odhin and his brothers/aspects married to the Norns, and we know which aspect is married to which Norn! Now, I don't know that I buy that these identifications are "true" in some objective sense, but the potential insights that come from these sorts of interlocking associations is precisely where Kvilhaug's approach shines.

<h3 id="orgfa0cf3e">Wandering Husbands Disperse Illusions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfa0cf3e">
<p>
For this bit, Kvilhaug brings together the story, told in <i>Ynglinga Saga</i>, where Odhin left the Aesir for some time, and so his brothers Vili and Ve both married Frigg while He was away, with the story of Freyja looking for Her lost husband Odh. She uses this to layout the case for seeing Odhin and Odh as the same god (remember, <i>Odhinn</i> is just "Master of Odh" and <i>Odhr</i> is "Odh," so this one's pretty straightforward) and Frigg and Freyja as the same Goddess (less straightforward, but not crazy - Frigg and Freyja both derive from the same proto-Germanic root, a title that just means "Lady.") This is actually the case of "these different gods are actually the same" I think is one of the intellectually strongest - I was thoroughly convinced of it back when I was a materialist heathen, and I still find the arguments compelling. That being said, at least for my practical religious life, I got clear instructions to worship Freyja and Frigg separately, as two distinct goddesses, so that's what I do. Anyway, Kvilhaug says both of these are stories about what happens when you lose touch with spirit/the divine, which seems fine as far as it goes. What I found most helpful is her suggestion about where the heck did Odhin/Odh <i>go</i> anyway? I don't think I've ever run into anyone speculating on that before, just accepting that the Wanderer's gonna wander. She links this with his visit to Vafthrudhnir for a wisdom competition (as told in <i>Vafthrudhnismal</i>). Kvilhaug sees Vafthrudhnir ("Powerful Head Veil," she says, but again, other scholars differ) as representing the forces of illusion that hide the true nature of Being from us (think Buddhist <i>maya</i>), and so as long as your spirit is caught up contending with illusion, it's not doing it's job of running your soul. If nothing else, an interesting way to approach these myths, with lots to think about.

The emphasis is on how there are multiple stories where a valkyrie (who, remember, Kvilhaug sees as a personalized fate goddess of a warrior/initiate, who is Herself a manifestation of Fate Herself) is put to sleep by Odhinn, seemingly as some kind of punishment for something She has done, but perhaps for sneakier reasons, like for Her to be the proper motivation for a hero to achieve what he needs to achieve to become worthy of Valholl, and thus of Odhin's plans for him. As always, there's some good discussion of names and references to other tales and gods, sometimes unexpected ones, but this is one of those sections that's a bit repetitive.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4d8adbe">
<p>
Kvilhaug seems to have been ahead of the curve here a bit. In the last few years, since Iain McGilchrist has finished his two-volume magnum opus <i>The Matter with Things</i> (see <a href="https://barsoom.substack.com/p/left-and-right-brains-and-politics">here</a> for a great intro for such a big, gnarly topic, though be warned it is through the lens of political implications, which may not be to your taste), Left-Brain/Right-Braing stuff has been all over the place (at least, all over the kind of stuff I read online and in books). Kvilhaug speculates that what gets coded as "feminine" in Norse myth might be representative of right-brain thinking, whereas "masculine" is left-brain. I think there might be something to this, but I also think gender is its own whole thing, deeply embedded in our thought and experience in a different way than our two ways of processing things with our brain. Where I'm left is thinking it might be very interesting to systematically go through various myths and analyze them <i>as if</i> this is true, and see what pops out. Especially after I've had a chance to read more McGilchrist.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bd4c47">
<p>
Altogether, I think that bringing these myths together and looking for their parallels was a helpful exercise, and there are some real parallels to them. That being said, as I made abundantly clear throughout, I think the idea of a "golden age" and its loss is not necessarily the thread that holds all of these together, but instead, something a bit more abstract and general, which is the theme of losing, seeking, and/or finding something vital. All of these myths truly do point to aspects of the human condition that are/can be lost, and to the great spiritual rewards that come from living in proper relationship with them, but not all of them paint this desirable thing as something that was once universally known and is now universally missing unless we actively seek it. Instead, these stories run the gamut from true, universal golden age of the past that has been lost (like Frodhi's age of peace) to highly individual paths of seeking and initiation, like the heroes with their valkyries.
</p>

<p>
Once again, we run into my chief complaint with Kvilhaug and her particular perennialist/pantheist take on things: her overly strong tendency to see <i>everything</i> as the same, one thing. Rather than several stories about seeking something felt as a deep yearning for something lost, all of these stories must be about <i>the</i> golden age, and all of the characters must really be the same character. It strikes me as overly neat for a world as big, complex, and messy as we know this one to be - why would spiritual matters be much simpler? Maybe I ought to stop even pointing this out, since it's pretty well established by this point how Kvilhaug sees these things, and that I don't agree, but I thought I'd bring it up here, because it's not <i>only</i> a case of "all of these Goddesses are really just one Goddess," it's <i>also</i> "all of these stories are really just one story," which, weirdly, strikes me as <i>even more</i> reductive than melting every character together. Even if every God is one God, there can still be different stories about Him, right? If you dissolve the differences between all of the stories <i>too</i>, what are you left with? One undifferentiated Being doing one, undifferentiated thing, always? In the Neoplatonic Druid philosophy I've read, that's <i>literally</i> the state of Being between creations, the "cosmic night" that comes between the "cosmic days" of manifest Becoming that are everything we have known and can know in our present states.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, as I've said before, Kvilhaug's instinct to look for similarities, look for connections, look for hidden parallels is a good and useful one, but here, as elsewhere, she takes it past the point where I find it helpful.

<h2 id="seeking_stillness" class="Post">Seeking Stillness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-seeking_stillness">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-October-15
</p>

<p>
Things have been a bit&#x2026; harried lately, and I think not only for me, but for many. I find myself constantly feeling like there's something I have to do, something unfinished, something <i>pressing</i>. Often, this is because, you know, I <i>do</i> have unfinished work to do (job, kids, hobbies, spiritual practice, you know the drill). But I also think that it is often a stronger feeling than is warranted by the actual tasks on my plate, and that it comes more from the morass of popular culture and online interaction we all wade through, with its relentless novelty, variable interval reward schedules, and graphic depictions of every which extremity. All of that has left me craving moments of <i>stillness</i>, which is the only way I know how to put it - time where I feel truly at rest, like I'm not <i>doing</i> anything, but I'm also not <i>wasting</i> my time.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the few things I miss about a regular mindfulness/mantra meditation practice. When I was actually regular about doing 15-20 minutes of vipassana focused on the breath or Transcendental Meditation-style mantra meditation, I would pretty regularly find these states of stillness, and much of the calm followed me around throughout my day. An hour-long float tank session also produced similar results, for a day or two anyway. But the trouble was, if I took even a day or two off of meditation, many of these benefits went away, and then it took another 1.5 - 2 weeks to really get back to where I was getting what I was after. And keeping up a mindfulness meditation habit that consistently was <i>really hard</i> for me, for whatever reason.
</p>

<p>
Which is one of the reasons I've been so keen on <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#meditate_discursively">discursive meditation</a> - for me, anyway, it is <i>way</i> easier to keep up a regular practice. I've done at least a 5 minute placeholder meditation, and most days a full 15-20 minute meditation, darn near every day for about two and a half years now, a streak I got <i>nowehere</i> close to with mindfulness meditation. Discursive meditation has many of the same benefits of building good habits, getting you to notice what it feels like to become distracted, and just plain taking some time every day to sit still with good posture and breathe deeply, which has its own benefits. Unlike mindfulness meditation, discursive meditation also lets you think deeply and figure stuff out and hit upon unlooked-for insights into philosophical or spiritual material, at least on a good day. On the other hand, at least for me, and your mileage may vary, discursive meditation pretty much always feels like <i>work</i> - it is <i>another</i> of the obligations that has to be met, there is a difference between doing it right and not, and so forth. Also, though it helps practice willpower and concentration and other good things, again, at least for me, discursive meditation doesn't bring about those moments of <i>stillness</i> that seem to be an antidote to the busy-ness modern life so often immerses us in.
</p>

<p>
So, I have found myself craving such stillness and not getting it through the core of my daily spiritual practice (ritual, meditation, divination). Instead I have found two ways to reach that stillness, and they have been helping me cope with all of the&#x2026; everything going on in the world right now, including my own very mundane concerns about getting stuff done for my job, around the house, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The first practice I can recommend comes from John Michael Greer's <i>Druidry Handbook</i>, and that is to take 10-15 minutes and just go "be in nature." Now, that by itself is sufficient, but a few comments that might help. First off, many of us have an inflated sense of what counts as "in nature" - to be "in nature," you don't have to go ride a horse out from the farthest trailhead in Yellowstone to the least-accessible part of the park, so that you have nothing but trees and mountains and bears as your companions. Sure, all of that is nice (well, maybe not so much the bears as companions), but you know where else you can find "nature"? The squirrels getting frisky in the tree in your backyard. The planter full of flowers in your window. The weeds pushing through the cracks of a parking lot. Heck, in <i>your own body</i>, because you are yourself a part of nature. The point being that all of us can find some nature to focus on, even if there's no panoramic view or charismatic megafauna around. Once you find some "nature" to engage with, you have two options: laser focus or splatter vision. For laser focus, pick something <i>tiny</i>, like a few square inches of lawn or the veins on the back of your hand or the structure of the one dandelion poking between two chunks of sidewalk. Then, spend your 10-15 minutes really, really paying attention to that tiny thing. I promise there's way more detail there than you can actually process in that amount of time, or ever. Pushing through the boredom of "I've now seen everything there is to see here" and becoming again interested is part of the work. For splatter vision, you do the opposite - open up your awareness to anything and everything "natural" that happens within your field of senses in the next 10-15 minutes. Watch the clouds sail across the sky, listen to the songbirds get into a fight and run each other off, feel the temperature and humidity change as the sun creeps upward. As you do this, let your thoughts muse on what you see ("are those squirrels fighting or courting, or maybe both?" "What kind of weather system is making the clouds do that? Gosh, I don't know much about the weather at all, do I?" "What do roly-polies even eat, anyway?"), but try to return it to just paying attention to what you're attending to (whether with laser focus or with splatter vision). I try to do this at least once a week, and I notice my anxiety and stress are way lower when I do.

<p>
The second practice I've been finding helpful lately is part of my daily prayer. As <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#a_few_daily_prayers">I've talked about before</a>, I try to build prayer into my life throughout my day, but I try to have one daily "main" prayer, usually in the evening right after we get the girls down for bed. I have an altar ("stall" in heathen-speak), I light an oil lamp and some candles, and I make a couple of drink offerings. I have a handful of set prayers I say the same way each time, a different prayer each day of the week (for example, to Sunne on Sunday, Mone on Monday, and so forth), and then some free-form prayers as well. One of those freeform prayers is the last that I do before wrapping up. I call upon all of the Gods, Goddesses, well wights (spirits), and holy forebears I have prayed to, and I tell them that I'm opening myself to whatever they might want to send me - sight, sound, words, rede (advice), or whatever else. I then take a short time, usually something like 9 slow, deliberate breaths, where I try to quiet my mind and be receptive. Most days I don't "get" anything like a message or direct guidance, but I do get a few moments of calm, intentional stillness, with my attention turned toward the holy, and that seems to be quite helpful all by itself.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure there's much more I could be doing, if I were truly trying to minimize the amount of <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#a_few_thoughts_on_slack">hassle</a> I feel in my life, and all of the basics apply, of course - get enough sleep, eat healthy food, work out, get sun, and so forth. All that being said, these two practices are ones where I definitely notice when I let them slip, and I definitely feel better when I get them back to being a habit. If you have any ways you find moments of stillness, healing, and beauty amongst the hassle and hurly-burly, I'd love to hear about it.

<b>Date</b>: 2023-October-08
</p>

<p>
Five years ago tomorrow (Monday, October 9th), I knew what the call was about as soon as I saw it was from my dad. It wasn't a surprise, but it was a blow - after watching her waste away for the past couple of years, she was gone. She was ready to go, and she had told me so not a week before. It was <i>hard</i> watching someone so kind, so giving, hurting so badly, losing interest in everything that brought her joy, <i>literally</i> welcoming death as a relief from pointless, unending suffering.
</p>

<p>
At the time, I was an atheist and a materialist - I had never felt religion all that deeply, and it had come to seem like nothing more than a comforting illusion to make the crushing truths of a huge, uncaring universe more palatable. I was working on a being a good Rationalist - always seek the truth, even when it hurts, even when you wish it weren't so. There was some value in that ethos, but now, looking back, I remember that when my dad was talking about the difference between someone sleeping and a dead body made it clear that <i>something</i> that had been there was gone, something like a soul, and then when he and my sister were talking about her being in Heaven, I <i>made</i> myself acknowledge that no, she wasn't, she was gone. Only our memories of her remained. Sure, there was a certain amount of strength in this, but looking back, it was to no good end - I was just hurting myself.
</p>

<p>
Throughout her entire illness, I had been trying to practice what I preach and live and think as a good stoic. When I caught myself thinking about how unfair it was that a healthy, active, non-smoking woman in her 60s had lung cancer, I reminded myself of the little kids I had seen when I took her to appointments at one of the nation's top cancer hospitals. Fair had nothing to do with it. When I found myself wishing her primary care physician had read the chest x-ray for her persistent cough better a year earlier, when maybe we could have done something, I told myself that I could only do the best with what I had now, and couldn't change the past at all. Again, there was likely some merit in practicing such virtues in one of the hardest tests real life can throw you, but in my rush to "deal with" the hurt in a stoic and reasonable way, I don't think I gave myself enough room to, you know, <i>feel bad that my mom was dying</i>.
</p>

<p>
I had protected myself by retreating into my head (and into more whiskey than was good for me). I intellectually "understood" what had happened, and I assumed that was the end of it, because that's how most of my life works - work something out intellectually, and you've got it. I knew the facts, I had a philosophy of how to explain it, and I knew what the end state should look like, so what else could I need? Weirdly, though, I'd have experiences like finishing <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> and weeping uncontrollably. Or my wife would point out that I was sleeping too much. Or I'd let timelines slip at work. But I was fine, right?
</p>

<p>
So, things were rough for awhile, but I didn't realize how rough. I muddled along, and then I had a rather singular experience. Without going too much into it, let's say that I found myself in a not-exactly-ordinary state of consciousness. While experiencing this, I felt a deep, deep grief for my mom, and I began crying freely. What was unusual, though, was that this didn't feel like a <i>bad</i> thing - <i>of course</i> I was sad that my mom had died - what kind of monster would I be if I weren't? Of <i>course</i> it was a deep, strong, feeling - hadn't I loved her deeply, and wasn't her loss a deep wound? This is likely old news to everyone else, but the experience of 1. feeling a "negative" emotion not as a bad thing or failure, 2. <i>feeling</i> the emotion and realized that was distinct from thinking about it or understanding it, and 3. linking the negative feelings I was having with the positive feelings I had had from my whole life with her all led to a pretty profound shift in how I understood myself and my grief.
</p>

<p>
Since then, I've found religion, and I have a much more hopeful outlook on where she is, what's she's doing, and what it means for the spiritual life of myself and my family, and that certainly helps as well, but it was that shift that really mad ea difference. I named this post "remembering my mom," and I've spent it almost entirely talking about myself. In part, what else can I say? It's far from rare to find someone singing his mother's praises, and often, those praises are remarkably similar: kindness, care, comfort - all the stereotypically "maternal" things. Well, I'd be adding to that chorus. My mom was a <i>wonderful</i> mother, in every way you could hope for a mother to be - kind, interested, nurturing, funny, supportive, understanding. So, take all of that as given, please. Instead, I'd like to share a few things about her that are less ubiquitous, all the while realizing that in many ways, it's a hopeless task: she was <i>my</i> mom, and no matter how many cute or funny anecdotes I share, she'll never have wiped your forehead when you were sick, helped you turn squiggles on a page into words, or pleaded with you not to join the army. All that being said, she deserves to be remembered, and putting a bit of that memory into writing helps me crystallize it and get ready to share it with my daughters, when they're ready to hear them.
</p>

<p>
My mom's father died when she was in high school, and that put her in a hard spot. He had been born to be a pilot. His father gave him money to go to college, and he took it and went to flight school instead. He loved it. By all accounts, he was a natural. Too old for fighter duty, he flew Catalinas to South American bases in WWII, and after the war, flew for a time. But in the 40s and 50s, the piloting profession was not kind to aging eyesight, and so he spent my mom's life bouncing between jobs that could pay the bills, but just - apartment manager, driving instructor, that kind of thing. When he died, my grandmother began working, and my mom stepped up to help take care of her little sister. She got into a minor regional state school and took advantage of the generous scholarship opportunities for folks pursuing a teaching certificate. Not long after graduation, she met a young engineer with his heart set on the automotive industry, and they fell in love and stayed there for the next 45 years. She followed him to the suburbs of Detroit, then back to Dallas when the auto industry got smacked in the 70s, and a few more places after that as my dad found his career in the oil industry. On their first few stops, she taught middle and high school, mostly history and English. When my sister was born, she stopped working and focused on us, until, that is, I went to pre-school, which gave her the opportunity to discover her true calling - pre-school teacher. The ridiculous sweaters. The inability to pass up talking to small children encountered in stores or on the street. Deep, loving, kind patience with the utterly ridiculous, but honestly felt, titanic feelings of four-year-olds. Whatever challenges my mom had had with the teenagers she taught before my sister and me, she was a natural with the little kids.
</p>

<p>
When my dad's work moved us to northern Virginia, he was doing well enough she didn't need to work, and her mother had moved in with us, so she didn't look for any teaching jobs, pre-school or otherwise. She never had to work again. Things were a bit rough at times with her mom, a strong-willed woman losing her wits to strokes and regular aging, but overall, we were happy and comfortable as my sister went through high school and I started it. Then my dad's work moved him again, this time to Houston, and my grandmother ended up in a nursing home near my mom's younger sister, rather than with us - I wasn't privy to everything that went into those conversations, but I'm pretty sure a part of it was my mom saying something like "I've done my part, it's your turn now" (after over 40 years of being the dutiful one to her sister's rebelliousness). Once in Houston, my sister was in college, I was in high school, and financially, we were doing better than ever, so my mom found herself having a grand old time. The one very weird exception, is that is my senior year of high school, my mom was clingy for the only time in her life that I saw. Now, once I went to college, she realized how great it was not having kids to take care of any more, especially with my dad still working and them making plenty of money, but for a few months there, she was a little funny.
</p>

<p>
When I met a beautiful and smart young woman who I wanted to build my life with, my mom welcomed her into the family with open arms. When she found out we had a kid on the way, she was excited enough to overcome the lack of energy that had begun to infect everything in her life once the chemo started. Besides throwing baby showers from her literal death bed, she took advantage of the temporary relief brought by the chemo to take some wonderful trips to Europe with my dad, including a cruise on a smallish sailing yacht through the Cyclades. As she lost taste for the weekly dinners we brought over, as she lost interest in the soap operas she had followed for longer than I had been alive, as she even lost interest in the science fiction and fantasy books she had read since she was a child, not <i>once</i> did she lose sight of the lives of her children, the comfort of her pregnant daughter-in-law, or the needs of the husband who had had to suddenly reverse from "totally taken care of" to caregiver in less than a year.
</p>

<p>
These days, I've accepted that she's gone in the way I knew her, but I believe that in more important ways, she's still around. It's still tough. We went to her grave today and I gave a toast over one of her favorite wines (J. Lohr Cabernet Sauvingon - as she and my dad had more money, she came to appreciate fancy things, but she never lost the ability to appreciate something good that was also a deal). While we stood there, my almost-5-year-old whose baby showers my mom organized alternated between the earnest, but ridiculous questions of a four year old ("do the men who bury people wait until they die to do it?") to the truly heartbreaking insights of unfiltered innocence ("how does grandma Jenny know we  brought her flowers?"), my almost-one-year-old bucked and cooed and screamed and wondered why she couldn't crawl around, and meanwhile, my dad was holding back tears. As awkward as it was, it seemed fitting. <i>No one</i> would have better understood the finnicky behavior of little kids than her. No one would have been more thrilled to see their happy, beautiful faces. No one would have felt more deeply my father's sadness, or the gladness that my wife and I or my sister and her boyfriend share. In its chunky, organic, unstaged <i>life</i>, it was the perfect tribute.
</p>

<p>
I had a few anecdotes I thought I'd share, about how funny, or supportive, or unexpectedly firm she was, but I think those might be for me and mine. So, instead, I'll make a small ask: if anything above has moved you, or touched anything in you, then please raise whatever it is you might be drinking in a toast to my mother Jenny. So much of who I am is thanks to you, and I hope this small tribute gives some honor to that.

This chapter has a fair amount of overlap with Kvilhaug's book <i>The Goddess Idhunn in Poetry and Myth</i>, which I read and took extensive notes on, so I was able to go through this one a bit quicker. It's also much shorter than most of the earlier chapters, so this will likely be a quicker write-up than some in the series so far. Right up front, I have to say that I don't <i>really</i> understand Kvilhaug's central conclusion: that Idhunn is the "Soul of the Gods." I'll get into that as we go, but I thought I should highlight that whatever else follows <i>might</i> be tainted by an overall sense of confusion.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org353b04c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org353b04c">We Find Idhunn in Three Works - the Haustlong, the Prose Edda, and Hrafnagaldr Odhins</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org353b04c">
<p>
Kvilhaug relies on three works (the first two more than the third) for her analysis of the Idhunn myth, with good reason: these are the only texts we have that talk about Idhunn! I'll start with the middle text, which is Snorri's <i>Prose Edda</i>. As discussed <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_1_introduction_and_the_books_of_old">before</a>, Snorri's masterwork is both a (literal?) Godssend as well as somewhat complicated to deal with thanks to the religious landscape when he wrote. On the one hand, he gives us the most straightforward telling of the Idhunn myth, one without which interpretation of the <i>Haustlong</i> would be rather murky at best, and the <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i> would be utterly opaque. In fact, <i>so</i> readily interpretable is Snorri, that some scholars have accused him of making up much of the myth and modeling it more along classical lines (like the apples of the Hesperides, and so forth). Kvilhaug argues, and I agree, that the rather old (early 10th century) skaldic poem <i>Haustlong</i> shows enough detail that much of what Snorri relates about the tale must be at least as old as that poem. Importantly, that poem was composed by an actually heathen skald, known for his learning and wisdom, for an actually heathen audience, in an act that was fundamentally religious in a heathen way.
</p>

<p>
Quick aside: here's what I mean. The well-known skald, Thodholfr or Hvinir was given a princely gift: a shield painted with scenes from two myths: Loki's betrayal of Idhunn and her abduction by Thjazi (more below), and Thor's fight against the strongest of tall the jotnar, Hrungnir. Back then, amongst the nordic folk, giving a gift was a fundamentally religious act. You took some of your stored up luck, wealth, and good name, and you put it into a physical object, and then you gave that physical object to someone else, thus giving them that portion of your luck, wealth, and good name, because it was a grand and noble thing to do, and the Gods smiled upon it, and sometimes added some of their own luck, wealth, and good name to those of gift-giver and/or receiver. Now, if you were given such a wonderful gift and were yourself religious (as we have no reason to believe someone so skilled in the <i>holy</i> art of skaldship would not be), your immediate response is "I am in this man's debt! How do I give him some of <i>my</i> luck, wealth, good name, and so forth, hopefully with some of the Gods' to boot, to demonstrate that I am just as awesome and sensitive to the ways of Gods and men as he is?" Well, if your name is Thodholfr of Hvinir, the way you do that is by busting out your top-notch skald skills to compose a poem <i>about your sweet gift</i> as its own sweet gift in return. This is an A+ heathen move, by the way. Thodholfr 1. honored and magnified the gift he was given, and thus the name and reputation of the man who gave it to him, by telling everyone, even folks over <i>a thousand years later</i> what a great gift it was, 2. gave back a gift of comparable (or maybe even better?) artistry, by setting his well-skilled hand to crafting a poem, and 3. did all of this in the divine art of poetry about the Gods Themselves, making everything appropriate religiously.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the point here is that we have a very old (by written Germanish standards) poem, a medium-old prose retelling by a known scholarly badass, but with his Christian conflicts, and a poem of indeterminate age that is all kinds of weird and mixed up. As we talked about back in the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_1_introduction_and_the_books_of_old">first post in this series</a>, <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i> is a poem that was included in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> for a long time, eventually got kicked out for being "not authentic enough," and now enjoys a mixed status, where some scholars believe it to be from the same time as other Eddic poems, others seeing it as the later recreation of an antiquarian. I'm with Kvilhaug in seeing it as useful enough from a heathen religious perspective to give it serious attention. One interesting (but likely impossible to answer) question is: does the <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i> have nowhere-else seen kennings for Idhunn given by Snorri because the author read Snorri and forced them in there, or because Snorri knew this poem and used it to compile his list of kennings?
</p>

<p>
The overall takeaway is that Snorri's prose telling of the myth of the abduction of Idhunn is our clearest understanding of the story, the version told in fits and starts of allusive verse in the <i>Haustlong</i> is very compatible with that, which suggest the story was genuinely old, and then the <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i> adds some further wrinkles that you may or may not take seriously depending on when you date that poem and how committed to reconstructionism you are.

<h3 id="org84f583c">The Myth - A Descent into Death and Return</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org84f583c">
<p>
Okay, so, let's take a moment to tell the story at the heart of these different versions discussed above. Odhinn, Hoenir, and Loki are traveling around, and they get hungry, and they find a herd of oxen, so they kill one of the oxen and start cooking it in a big "earth oven" (likely picture a pit-barbecue type situation, like at a luau). They keep checking, though, and the ox won't cook. They look up, and there's a "not small" (typical Norse understatement for "frickin' huge") eagle sitting in a tree looking down at them intently. Loki starts to think the eagle has something to do with it and is like "what's up, bird? Why are you messing with our dinner?!" So, the eagle is like "well, I'm hungry too. Promise me my choice of the finished meat and I'll let it cook." The three Gods agree, and sure enough, finally the ox cooks reasonably quickly. When it's time to let the eagle take his share, yoink! He takes the whole dang ox! Loki is starving and won't have none of this, so he starts wailing on the eagle with a stick. Unfortunately for him, the stick "sticks" to the eagle, who starts flying off with the ox in its claws, and Loki hanging on to the stick, unable to let go. The eagle flies low, smashing Loki into stuff along the way, and Loki, fearing for his life, begs the eagle to tell what will make him stop. The eagle says that Loki must bring him the goddess Idhunn, keeper of the apples that keep the Gods young. Loki agrees, and after he gets back to Asgard, proceeds to trick Idhunn outside the walls by saying he found some new apples that remind him or her special ones, and the eagle, revealed to be the jotun Thjazi, snatches up Idhunn and takes her back to his hall in Thrymheim. The Gods begin to grow old, and knowing where to look when trouble shows up, they confront Loki. He admits what He did, and promises to get Her back, but to do so, He'll need to borrow Freyja's falcon-shape, which she agrees to. So He turns into a falcon, flies to Thrymheim, finds Idhunn there and Thjazi out, turns her into a nut, and then flies home with Her in His falcon claws. However, Thjazi gets back just as they're leaving, again turns into an eagle, and chases after. Back in Asgard, the Gods are keeping up a sharp watch, and they see this chase coming their way, so they pile up a bunch of wood and prepare to light a huge bonfire. Right as Loki gets back, Thjazi hot on his tail, they fire up the wood, and roast Thjazi to death. Well, it turns out Thjazi has a daughter, Skadhi, and she comes seeking restitution for her murdered father. The Aesir and Vanir are a bit ashamed of the whole business, and offer to let Her marry one of the Aesir. She agrees, but only if She gets to pick which one, <i>and</i> if someone amongst Them can make Her laugh (with the smell of her roasted father still lingering in the air, that's a tall order). The Aesir agree, but stipulate that she must pick her husband by his feet, and She says "fine, whatever." Seeing the most handsome feet, she thinks that must be Baldr, who she wants to marry (handsomest and kindest of all the Gods, primo husband material), but it turns out that's Njordhr, whose feet are so nice because He is (among other things) the God of the sea, and stands with his feet in the waves all day, which I guess is a hell of an exfoliant or something. As for the laughing, Loki tries everything, until finally, in desperation, he ties a rope to a goat's horns, and the other end to his, ahem, manhood, and when the goat yanks him off his feet yelping, he falls into Skadhi's lap and she bursts out laughing to see him humiliated so.
</p>

<p>
Great story, right? Admittedly a bit different than the version in <i>D'aulaires' Norse Myth</i> that I read my daughter earlier today, but even that version was interesting. Well, let's dive into some of what we can take from it besides the entertainment value.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org03a9ddb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org03a9ddb">Thjazi - The Eagle of Death</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org03a9ddb">
<p>
Maybe the single biggest contribution Kvilhaug made to my understanding of this myth is the idea that Thjazi very likely is death personified. "Jotun," the word usually translated "giant," likely means something like "devourer," and many/most jotnar are associated with primal worldly or cosmic powers, rawer and more dangerous than those wielded by the Gods, but sources of wisdom and strength nonetheless. "Thjazi," means something like "Slave-Binder," which is a pretty great name for Death (especially if you happen to be an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IgoitlgZOI">Iron Maiden fan</a>). But where does she get this? Well, for one thing, though eagles <i>sometimes</i> carry the symbolic meaning of "majestic, proud bird, royalty of the air" that you see in other cultures, in Norse culture, the eagle is <i>also</i> seen as another eater of the dead, like crows and ravens. Also, eagles are often associated with "winds," such as the eagle <i>Hraesvelgr</i> ("Corpse Swallower"), who is the source of all winds in the cosmos, and Kvilhaug argues that wind is a symbol for death, and "windless" or "wind-shielded" are used to indicate deathlessness. I find all of this plausible, but on the wind = death bit, I <i>really</i> wish she was more clear if that's her own interpretation, commonly accepted among scholars, one guy's theory from way back, or what. Anyway, this is a place where I think Kvilhaug's penchant for equating figures actually helps a great deal - she believes that Hraesvelgr, the otherwise unnamed eagle who sits in Yggdrasill, and Thjazi are all one and the same, and all of them are manifestations of Death. One <i>really</i> interesting thread I have not yet been able to satisfactorily track down, though, is that if you go with the theory that Thjazi is Death, then what you have is Death kidnapping a Goddess and the divine order being thrown into disarray because of it until She is brought back - which makes me think of Hades and Persephone. What's <i>really</i> interesting about this potential parallel is that the Hades-Persephone myth was the central myth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>, which purportedly granted its initiates some kind of relief from the typically not-great fate after death, and in this Norse myth, the Goddess taken is <i>explicitly</i> linked with immortality. That gets my comparative myth knickers all in a twist with implications, but again, I haven't been able to follow this up in the depth I'd like to one day.

<h3 id="org426ee6c">Two Goddesses - Shining Maiden and Fierce Ogress</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org426ee6c">
<p>
One of Kvilhaug's recurring points, discussed in the previous chapter, is the frequent appearance of a pair made up of a shining, beautiful Goddess and an Ogress. The shining Goddess is always beautiful, linked with knowledge and initiation and immortality, whereas the ogress is often (but not always) hideous, knows great and terrible secrets, and is linked with death and obliteration. The most dramatic example is Hel, where the two halves are literally united in one person. Kvilhaug, rolling the way she does, believes all of these examples are just manifestations of the <i>same</i> pair of light and dark divine femininity, and thinks Hel is maybe the "truest" expression. I don't know if I go <i>that</i> far, but it is certainly an important pattern, and Kvilhaug points to Idhunn and Skadhi as one such pair. Skadhi's name means something like "injury," and She is a fierce Goddess of skiing and hunting and the like, so she likely can be seen as the death that's waiting for you out in the wilderness when you push a little too hard and end up with a broken ankle at the bottom of a ravine. Kvilhaug points out how Idhunn basically stops being part of the story the moment Skadhi comes on, and says this indicates they were two sides of the same coin. I'm not <i>totally</i> convinced, but I think it's a very interesting line of thinking, especially when you look at everything else that happens with Skadhi - she marries into the Aesir, her marriage to Njordh is not great, as He's a beach guy and She's a mountain chick (to over simplify), and according to some traditions, She ends up having a baby with Odhinn who becomes the start of the Norwegian royal line.
</p>

<p>
One idea of Kvilhaug's I found especially intriguing in this regard is that the ogress has the great and powerful secret knowledge, but it is the maiden's job to help the seeker <i>remember</i> it, with the mead and all that that we talked about <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_3_the_maiden_with_the_mead">last time</a>. As I said there, a thought that has been stuck in my head is putting together Kvilhaug's interpretation with my current understanding of how the spiritual path works. I am working my way through traditions that hold that we reincarnate countless times, and that most of what we think of as our "identity" can be called the "personality" - the set of habits of thought, behavior, emotion, and so forth that make you the exact person you are in this incarnation. These traditions teach, though, that our personality is temporary and not that important. Rather, what persists from life to life is our <i>individuality</i> - this is our truest and highest self, it carries the character developed by karma from life to life, and the main goal of spiritual practice is to get more in touch with it and less enthralled to our personality. Between lives, all of this is clear, as we process what just happened in our last life and incorporate its lessons into our individuality, but then as we sink back into incarnation, it's a bit like drifting off to sleep. One metaphor from these traditions is that your personality is the dream your individuality is having for the length of this incarnation.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so let's put these two ideas together. As we've seen, the Norse myths place a great emphasis on "memory," and especially memory of divine wisdom, often gained through an initiatory act, dangerous quest, or with the help of a spiritual helper. Our current example is the pattern of a seeker asking a dangerous and scary ogress for knowledge about the world, which She has, and which <i>is</i> useful, but just knowing it seems not to be enough. The maiden who helps him to "remember" is a key part of the process. I wonder if what might be happening here is a description of a spiritual process by which useful divine wisdom is learned, and then made a part of the individuality, and the person is prepared to "come back to" the individuality more and more readily. I certainly don't have anything other than intellectual, bookish speculation, but it strikes me as worth meditating on more!

<h3 id="org19bb38a">Shamanic Soul Retrieval</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org19bb38a">
<p>
Another interesting wrinkle to the story of Idhunn's abduction as we have it is the amount of "shamanic" stuff that turns up in it. As I think I mentioned in an earlier post, this is an area of inquiry into Norse myth and religion that I think is very much worth looking into, but has some issues. First off, the reason for promise. The folks who lived or live on the fringes of the arctic circle (sometimes called "circumpolar") have certain broad cultural similarities. How much of that is due to similar environment, borrowing from each other, or common ancestry is a topic of much debate, so for now, let's just take as a premise "their cultures have certain similarities." One of those widely-seen similarities is the practice of something that got labeled in the late 19th or early 20th century "shamanism," due to the word for it in the tongue of one of these folk groups in Siberia, as filtered through Russian. Without going too much into what these practices are, various ethnologists of the 19th and 20th century noticed that they were not only similar among the circumpolar group, but that many practices of indigenous folks around the world (especially North and South America) looked pretty similar. The recognition of <i>those</i> similarities led in the late 20th century and the 21st century so far to a lot of alternative spirituality types talking about "shamanism" as a hip and trendy set of practices, sometimes with psychedelics, sometimes without. All of this is to say that any digging into hints of "shamanic" practices or beliefs in the Norse lore could be a lot of different things.
</p>

<p>
With all of that out of the way, I think it is almost certain that the beliefs and practices of the circumpolar peoples influenced the Norse and their lore - they were close neighbors for thousands of years, and in the historical period, we have stories of indigenous folks being sought out for their particular wisdom or magic. Anyhow, the relevance for this myth is that Kvilhaug claims that it follows the overall pattern of a shamanic "soul retrieval." One of the beliefs/practices common among the circumpolar folks is that someone's soul (or one of their souls, or part of their soul) can be lost or taken by hostile spiritual forces. This causes a slow, wasting sickness. The shaman is brought in to make a journey through spiritual realms to find the soul and bring it back, healing the patient. There are some elements in the story that suggest Idhunn plays the role of "soul" and the wasting sickness is obviously the aging felt by the Gods. The first maybe-clue is the stick that Loki tries to hit Thjazi with - a staff or stick was often used by shamans to create a repetitive beat to induce altered states of consciousness for spiritual journeys. Loki is then taken on a journey of a kind, one that he can't seem to stop (a bad trip?). Thjazi's realm Thrymheim might mean something like "the land of drumming" - again, drums were a common tool of circumpolar shamans. The shape shifting into animals is another trait of how shamans described what happened on spiritual journeys. All of which is to say, it's an interesting hypothesis, and at least plausible, but I'm not sure where else to go with it.

<h3 id="org188409f">Remember the "Formulae" - Here's a Refresher on Gender as Metaphor for the Known and the Unknown</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org188409f">
<p>
In this chapter, Kvilhaug also gives a quick refresher on her idea of "formulae" that we talked about back in the introduction, and she is helpfully specific. Kvilhaug argues that when you see a pair of figures in a myth, one masculine, the other feminine, the masculine figure represents the obvious, clear, outward expression or cause of something, whereas the feminine figure embodies the obscure, hidden, inner expression or cause. Further, the nature of the relationship between the masculine and feminine figure tells you something: if it's a husband and wife, then it's usually a pair of different, but complementary concepts or forces. If a brother and sister, concepts or forces that are seen as two sides of the same coin. If a one-time liaison, then it implies they are somewhat complementary, but maybe not wholly balanced. Significantly here, a daughter represents the hidden, non-obvious results of the father's obvious actions. You could also look at Loki's obvious, outward actions (stealing Idhunn) and Idhunn as the hidden cost (the aging). None of this is that shocking to anyone who's ever read any Jung, but Kvilhaug states it in a helpful and straightforward way here, and for all the ragging I do on her, I try to give full credit where she truly is helpful and insightful.

<div id="outline-container-org4f9e3d4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4f9e3d4">"The Soul of the Gods" - What Does Kvilhaug Actually Mean Here?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f9e3d4">
<p>
Okay, as I mentioned above, this is the bit of this chapter that has me thrown off. Kvilhaug argues that Idhunn should be seen as the shared, collective "soul of the Gods," Her loss as equivalent to a man losing his soul, and Her retrieval akin to a shamanic soul retrieval, as discussed above. I think she makes a compelling enough case, I don't have a <i>problem</i> with this interpretation, I just don't really <i>understand</i> it.
</p>

<p>
First off, let's take this at face value: the Gods are distinct beings, but they share "a soul" in the shape of Idhunn. What the heck does that mean? What is a shared soul? Is it but one soul among many, one part of the soul, or what? Whatever it is, what do we <i>mean</i> to say She is a "soul" that is "shared" by all of the Gods, other than that to lose Her will make Them grow old?
</p>

<p>
Secondly, and maybe even harder to understand, is how does this interpretation interact with her pantheistic beliefs? My understanding of Kvilhaug's pantheism is that she believes there is a vast, undifferentiated divinity that touches (or is?) all things. The various Gods, Goddesses, and other beings are aspects, manifestations of that unified godhead - maybe more akin to masks or costumes than to "separate" beings. This is why she sees "the same" God or Goddess in different tales with different names - she thinks they are merely functionally similar manifestations of the same less-personal divinity. At least, that's my understanding so far. Well, if that's the case, then what does it mean for these masks to "have a soul?" Wouldn't the soul just be another aspect of the same pantheistic godhead? Here, it's less weird for the masks to share something (they're all manifestations of the same underlying divinity, right?), but I don't get what calling that something a "soul" even means.
</p>

<p>
Really, this is not rhetorical - I'm scratching my head here. If you have some thoughts on how to get this through my thick head, I'd be much obliged.

<div id="outline-container-org0198cab" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0198cab">Loki as the "Mover of the Stories"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0198cab">
<p>
Kvilhaug uses one section to talk about one of Loki's rather interesting titles: the "Mover of Stories." She points out that this implies that the skalds of yore fully understood what he was doing in the tales where he was involved - turning them into interesting stories, making "something" happen. To that point, I agree with her. Where she maybe goes a bit far, is to put this together with the lack of evidence for historical worship of Loki (no place names with his name, no inscriptions, no statues or amulets, written accounts, and so forth) to argue that Loki was <i>purely</i> a literary invention of the skalds to make for some interesting stories. As we've talked about, I'm generally skeptical of her tendency to see <i>any</i> "characters" in the lore as "purely literary invention," and she's perfectly willing to make that assumption, because she sees all of the Gods and Goddesses as just aspects of a pantheistic godhead anyway. I'm not so sure. Worship of Loki is a controversial topic in modern heathenry. Many cite the lack of evidence for worship along with the seemingly clear arc from "friend of the Gods" to "harbinger of the end times" to say that He is clearly an evil figure and not fit for worship. Others say that's just reading too much of the Christian devil into Him. Still others say hey, that's a good point, maybe He was a later addition by Christian-influenced folks, and so you shouldn't worship Him for that reason either. On the other hand, folks who <i>do</i> worship Loki point out that the absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence. They also point to his central role in some <i>very</i> important myths and draw comparisons with "trickster" figures in the beliefs of other cultures. For myself, worship of Loki is not currently part of my practice, mostly because I've heard that folks who do worship Him often end up acting like jerks, and because I haven't sorted out what to make of Him and His role in the lore. That being said, I think treating Him with disrespect is likely unwise, and I remain open to seeing where my practice takes me. If nothing else, I think the thought that He is "just" a literary figure is likely wrong.

<p>
I just finished reading the <i>Book of the Subgenius</i> this week. It only took me two and a half years. I read it in bits and pieces, a little at a time. If you've read the <i>Book of the Subgenius</i>, you might have a pretty good guess as to what activity the reading accompanied, but it also took me a while since I took all of 2022 off from it, since the authors are <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">still alive</a>. If you're not familiar, the Church of the Subgenius is&#x2026; very weird, to say the least. I first heard about them in high school reading the <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/Church-of-the-SubGenius.html">jargon file</a> and then heard some vague things about them over the years by hanging around nerdy subcultures, but I never really got beyond recognizing "Bob" and references to "Slack." You don't really need to know too much about them for this post, but if you want to get a feel, <a href="https://dobbstown.org/film/">this documentary</a> was excellent and hilarious, and helped me to put several things together before I dived into the book. The short version is that the Church of the Subgenius is entirely a joke and parody of religion while also being a real religion that meets spiritual needs for its followers. If you don't like paradoxes like this, you should stay away from their "holy book," <i>The Book of the Subgenius</i>. What I want to talk about more than the religion itself is its chief goal: slack.

<h3 id="org42ed80e">Slack Means You Do What You Want</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org42ed80e">
<p>
Two of my favorite, but very different takes on slack come from <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/slack-an-irreverent-proposal/">John Michael Greer</a> and <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/">Zvi Mowshowitz</a>. One thing I like about these two, is they both do a pretty good job of defining what is inherently a nebulous topic, usually better illustrated through examples than crisp definitions, but they both get pretty close. To smash together a few points Greer made in his post, slack is the condition of not going all out all the time, which means it is resilience, which means it is the opposite of efficiency. What I especially like about Greer's definition is the way it points out that two "good" things can still be at odds, even be literal opposites of each other.  Mowshowitz, being a Rationalist, gets even further in a crisp, verbal, declarative-knowledge definition of something that might be better explored through allusion, metaphor, and <i>gnosis</i>. His definition is: "The absence of binding constraints on behavior." Now, despite the ribbing in my last sentence, this <i>is</i> a very good definition that has more to it than it might first appear. For, after all, "constraints on behavior" can take the form of resources, relationships, obligations, or even moral codes. In a twisted way, you might say the psychopath has a certain amount of slack not available to the psychologically normal.
</p>

<p>
I bring up this rather distasteful example to make a wider point - <i>doing what you want</i> has several variables that go into it: <i>can</i> you do what you want? <i>will</i> you do what you want? <i>what</i> do you actually want? All of these variables can be tweaked to get more slack - increase your capabilities, increase your willpower, and get clearer on what you want and spend more time on that than on other stuff. If you have a job that you feel is stealing your slack, well, you can 1. quit your job, 2. try to figure out what about your job could make slack rather than steal it, 3. quit trying so hard and see if you find slack that way, or any other number of other options. That's part of what makes slack such a valuable thought - it's specific enough to guide behavior, but open-ended enough to allow some flexibility (fittingly enough). What is perhaps most important to think about is how slack is <i>personal</i>. What gives you slack might stress me out, and even worse, what gives me slack in one situation might not in another.

<h3 id="orga1c7522">Hassle is What Steals Your Slack</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga1c7522">
<p>
Now, this is a bit of terminology I came up with on my own. If we can think of slack, then it makes sense to think about the opposite: hassle. Anything that takes your slack is hassle. So, anything that puts a constraint on your behavior, anything that stops you from doing what you want, that's hassle. Again, notice that hassle is very <i>personal</i> - work that I find stultifying might be enriching for you. Work that at one time I might not sweat, at another time might stop me from doing what I <i>truly</i> need to do. What's even worse is that work that <i>might</i> be good for you could be hassle if you have already said "yes" to too much work - helping at the food bank, or teaching at a local school, or working a shift at a business you care about might individually be good for you, even supportive of slack, but maybe all three would be hassle. Again, moral or cultural or conventional views of what you should do and not do could also be hassle, if you don't really agree with them.

<h3 id="org47b739b">Slack is Not Only Physical, but Metaphysical</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org47b739b">
<p>
Now, if you've been following along, you might be asking "isn't 'slack' just the same kinda thing as Nassim Taleb's 'antifragility?'" There are some definite overlaps, and in <i>Skin in the Game</i>, Taleb dives into some of the more moral aspects of his view of uncertainty, which gets a little closer to what slack is doing. But altogether, one of the things the <i>Book of the Subgenius</i> nails, that is hard to get from outside descriptions of slack, is that this is an actual, desirable, metaphysical quality. Now sure, the <i>Book of the Subgenius</i> conveys this through ridiculous jokes and exaggerations and short-of-breath monologues, but it <i>does</i> do a very good job of getting the point across. I mentioned above that the Church of the Subgenius is a very weird example of something that is at once satire and something serious. I think the main way they pull this off is by gleefully ignoring logical coherency in favor of <i>aesthetic</i> coherency. The fact that part of the aesthetic is contradiction and madness somehow paradoxically <i>adds to the coherency</i>. It's wild. The point is that slack is not merely the ability to rationally do what you want to achieve concrete ends in the real world. It is the feeling that what <i>you</i> want matters, whatever else the society around you says. It is the willingness to cast aside <i>very serious</i> obligations because they do not actually serve what you want or need. Heck, slack is both working you keister off on your own start up idea or checking out at your corporate job and doing the bare minimum not to get fired. At its heart, slack is a joyful embrace of the worth, sacredness, and autonomy of the individual, expressed in the crassest and most ridiculous ways available.

<h3 id="org4604d71">The Link with Capacity for Violence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4604d71">
<p>
I have one more thought on slack that's even more out-there than what I've shared so far. At one point after getting out of the Army, my wife asked me what it was like and what I missed. She knew that I had been mostly miserable for the last few years of my term of service, and that I was no fan of the Army generally speaking, but she also knew that I had expressed some positive thoughts every once in a while. One way I tried putting it was that I "liked being a soldier" but "hated being in the Army," which was my attempt to explain that I liked the skills capabilities I was required to learn, but not so much the career bureaucracy that came with them. But one night, on a walk through her mom's neighborhood on a pleasant San Antonio evening, I had an insight. What I truly missed was a sense of <i>ease</i>. I tried to explain to her what I meant by ease - I felt reassured that whatever I did, I'd be okay, that whatever trouble I got into, someone had my back, that whatever I put my mind to, I'd have some kind of good outcome. In spelling this out, I realized that what had given me this feeling was a combination of being in the best shape of my life, being as competent as I've ever been in shooting and hand-to-hand fighting, and perhaps most importantly, <i>being a part of an extremely tight-knit gang called a platoon</i>. If you're not familiar with the military, a platoon is a formation about 30-50 soldiers strong, led by a Platoon Leader (2nd Lieutenant, the most-junior rank of Commissioned officer in the Army) and advised by his Platoon Sergeant (an enlisted soldier with 15-20 years of experience, usually). The point is, day-to-day, your platoon is the group of guys you do everything with - going to the range? You shoot with your platoon. Doing exercises? You maneuver with your platoon. Cleaning bathrooms? You clean with your platoon. Sitting around smoking and joking? You sit around with your platoon. The point is that as a soldier, you have a multiply-reinforced relationship with your platoon. Now, I don't know about other specialties or units, but in an infantry platoon in the 82nd Airborne circa 2010-2012, there was certain, how do you say, <i>character</i>, to this grouping. Paratrooper are raised on a mythology of scrappy self-reliance, fighting spirit, and individual initiative. When you find yourself surrounded by 30-40 guys who have all drank deeply from this well, you discover that you are more than yourself. Sure, you might be fit, and dangerous, and willing to fight, but you're just some guy. A few dozen of your best friends, though, and now you've got something to reckon with. Now, it's not like I was ever in a bar fight with my platoon buddies backing me up. But I <i>always</i> knew that if it happened, they were there.
</p>

<p>
So what does this have to do with slack, which seems so peaceful? Well, being afraid of the violence someone might do to you is a constraint on your behavior, right? And removing that fear would remove a constraint, wouldn't it? The thing is, if you don't want to be delusional, to remove your fear of someone else's violence, you need to be able to offer your own violence, and <i>group</i> violence is waaay more effective than individual. What all of this means is that hardass military discipline is, paradoxically, a route to slack. Maybe not the only way, and maybe not the most effective way (remember circumstances!), but it's an aspect that I think often gets left out, since violence is distasteful and somewhat antithetical to what slack seems to be about. But if our goal is to truly have the most slack we might, we care naught for what slack 'seems' to be, and instead look to cultivate what will truly bring the most slack - even if that means finding a few dozen of your closest friends and getting good at hurting folks.

In this chapter, Kvilhaug shows that when she has a fairly well-defined topic, her tendency to draw in far-flung comparisons and links proves itself insightful and helpful, rather than confusingly scattered. It might also be that she comes off as more coherent here since she's building on the work she did for her master's thesis, so this is already a well-developed body of thought for her, and one which was subject to the supervision of an advisor. At any rate, though I still found plenty to write down here (for those keeping score at home, the backs of ten 4x6 notecards), it was a lot easier to keep the main thread of what this chapter was about in mind. It likely also helped that it was half the length of the last chapter. All that being said, let's see what Kvilhaug has to tell us about the Maiden and her Mead.
</p>

<h3 id="org077b057">The Heart of It - Tales about Mead-Serving Maidens are About Initiation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org077b057">
<p>
This was the topic of Kvilhaug's Master's Thesis, and it's the core idea in this chapter. In fact, most of the chapter is just giving examples of the pattern to point out variations and show how widespread it is. Maria's framework for this initiatory pattern has five stages: 1. Vision Quest, 2. Vision, 3. Descent, 4. Trials, and 5. Consecration. The vision quest typically involves engaging in some ecstatic techniques like fasting and ordeal, the vision brings some kind of knowledge or insight, the descent is into an otherworld, usually the land of the dead, the trials often involve proving eloquence and knowledge to a male giant related to the mead woman, and lastly, consecration is when the woman serves the hero mead and usually "embraces" him (if you catch my meaning). Not every example follows this pattern exactly, but it seems like a reasonable analysis to me. If nothing else, you can say that there's a recurring motif of a hero journeying somewhere, facing some challenges, and then being served magical mead of some kind by a maiden. Kvilhaug argues that this pattern represents the mythic grounding for real-life initiation rituals seeking esoteric knowledge.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1937dac">
<p>
Kvilhaug spends a chunk of this chapter discussing the archaeological and historical evidence for women serving mead in ritual contexts, which I found somewhat perplexing at first. Once I read through that bit, though, it became clear to me that what she was doing was trying to prove the plausibility of her theory that the myths give some kind of insight into real-life Heathen religious practice. The reason I found that surprising is because I find that claim fairly obvious, but then, I've been using myths as the basis for religious practice for the past few years, so maybe it's not as obvious to others as it is to me. Anyhow, the short version is that there were definitely important social and cultural rituals that featured women serving an alcoholic beverage to men. What the religious dimension of these rituals was is harder to say for certain, but it seems pretty clear that something was there. At any rate, Kvilhaug briefly references Michael Enright's excellent <i>Lady with a Mead Cup</i>, which goes into great depth on the role of first divinatory priestesses and later the Lord's wife in the Celtic and Germanic warband culture that arose as the Roman empire collapsed and eventually grew into the medieval social organization.

<h3 id="org8f641fc">Kvilhaug's Initiatory Formula Seems Mostly to Hold True</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f641fc">
<p>
Okay, so we're all on board with the idea that myths can tell us about religious practice, and that a recurring pattern is likely something important? So, what does Kvilhaug's pattern help us see? Well, first off, that there are <i>a lot</i> of these stories. Most folks who know anything about Norse lore at all have heard of Odin giving an eye to drink from the Well of Wisdom, and he brought back the mead of poetry, but it turns out those are far from the only stories about a magical drink. Apparently, Kvilhaug's thesis does more to step through the five stages identified above and demonstrate where they can be found in various myths, whereas this chapter focuses on the woman herself. In these tales, the woman is almost invariably described as some variation of "shining," is usually beautiful, and often rules some lands or folk. On the other hand, there is also often a counterpart, an ugly, fearful "ogress" associated with death, fetters, and darkness. Kvilhaug argues that these two female figures are like two sides of the same coin, the most extreme example being Hel, Goddess of the land of the dead, who is literally half bright and beautiful and half dark and dead. Interestingly, the esoteric knowledge sought by the hero is often given by the ogress, but it is the bright maiden who allows him to remember it.
</p>

<p>
Memory seems to be an <i>extremely</i> important thread in Germanish lore. Mimir, whose name likely means "memory" owns one of the wells from which the world tree draws its sustenance. That very tree is sometimes called "Mimir's Tree." When Mimir's head is cut off by the Vanir, Odin preserves it and consults it for wisdom. Speaking of Odin, His two ravens are named "Thought" and "Memory," and He says that though He fears losing both of them, He fears losing Memory more. Throughout the tales that Kvilhaug goes through in this chapter, the element of memory comes up again and again. The crucial moment in <i>Svipdagsmal</i> is when the titular character remembers his true name and past relationship with the maiden he seeks. This is an aspect of the lore that I want to dive more deeply into, but the ability to remember seems to be a key spiritual power sought by Gods and men alike.

<h3 id="orgf0dd463">It's All the Same Woman - Parallels and Equation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf0dd463">
<p>
I know I've harped on this before, but in this chapter, Kvilhaug explicitly argues for equating many (all?) of the "mead women" from these tales. In some cases, she gives interesting arguments for why two (or more) characters might be interpreted as the same Being called by different names, and obviously there is some of that going on in nickname and metaphor-heavy Norse poetry. Still, Kvilhaug seems to use a fairly monist view on things where ideas like "separate identities" for different deities are "more fluid" than we're used to these days, and the distinctions don't really matter, because they're all emanations of the same divinity anyway. Personally, I find this a little too neat for the messy world we actually live in. As I've said before, I'm working my way through a course of study that posits an essentially Neoplatonist view of Being, where there is a "One" that is the source of all life and consciousness, and in some important sense, everything that is is just a manifestation or aspect of that One. On the other hand, the course I'm working through says over and over again "these views are meant to train you to think about the world in certain ways, and not to be taken as infallible statements of how the world works on faith." I've come to be suspicious of any theories or ways of understanding that too readily fit into what humans find convenient. The thought that "you know, all of these similar, but <i>slightly</i> different ladies must actually be different takes on the same underlying divine power" strikes me as the kind of simplification that is appealing to human reasoning - it removes the messiness of individual experience, minor variations, idiosyncratic details, and so forth, and replaces all of that with a nice, easy to understand and explain abstraction. And that's not even touching the pragmatic side of things. Let's suppose that Gerdhr, and Freyja, and Frigg, and Jordh, and Ran, and Hel truly are, in some important sense, "the same" - there is a single divine "person" that answers to all of those names. Even if that is true, then why do we have tales about the different names? And why were there different religious practices for them? Maybe it is important to use the right name for the right situation. The reason for my scare quotes and tentative language is that these are ideas that I don't know if we can properly conceptualize, and even if we can, can we ever truly know the answers? It seems like an empirical approach is all we can hope for - say the prayers, do the rituals, and see what happens. And how are we to know whether many individual, highly finnicky rituals are the right way to go, or one unified, rationalized ritual? By trying them out and seeing what happens, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, for what it's worth, Kvilhaug is <i>very good</i> at spotting parallels between myths that might suggest the same God or Goddess is being called by a different name, or alluded to obscurely. This is great! It provides <i>wonderful</i> fodder for bethinking (meditation). I'm just not quite ready to accept that this is the "right" interpretation, and Kvilhaug seems pretty convinced. My other complaint is that she sometimes seems so ready to spot parallels that she doesn't carefully spell out why one exists. For example, there's a passage where she's drawing a comparison between Aegir's nine daughters and a list of "nine" valkyries - except there are 13 names in the list. She doesn't address this. At all. She just says "look at this list of nine valkyries," and then talks about the significances of the names (all 13 of them). Now, am I saying she's wrong? Not necessarily - maybe some of those names are referring to the same person, and it's clear from the Old Norse grammar in a way that the translation doesn't make clear. But if so, it'd be darn helpful if she shared that. Point being, I take all of Kvilhaug's analysis as interesting and potentially helpful <i>possibilities to ponder</i>, and not as "this is the one true way to understand this myth."

<h3 id="org912654b">Just Kidding, We Will Do Some Comparative Myth After All</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org912654b">
<p>
Remember back in chapter 1, when I <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#kvilhaugs_methods_of_interpretation">complained</a> that Kvilhaug's section headers were misleading, and it seemed like comparative mythology was going to be one of her pillars, but then she said she wouldn't be using it much? Well, in this chapter, she does decide to bring it in, which I personally find interesting and helpful, even if some of it is in service of her extreme willingness to equate different characters that I find frustrating. I suspect that she brought in the comparative myth here for the same reason she got into the archaeology we talked about above - she wants to counter skepticism about her core thesis, that seeking out a maiden with a magic drink was a very important element of at least esoteric heathen religion, and that the clues to it are in the myths. Again, I don't feel as much need for evidence, as I don't find that claim that hard to swallow. Anyway, whatever her reason for including it, the comparative material is quite interesting. For my druidly leanings, her discussion of Cerridwen and Taliesen is especially interesting. From an Indo-Europeanist standpoint, her comparisons of the mead with Haoma (Zoroastrian) and Soma (Hindu), and the <i>disir</i> of Norse myth (a word for "female spiritual beings" that seems to have fairly wide applicability) and the <i>dhisanas</i> of Hindu myth are all rather interesting. This is one place where Kvilhaug does more to back up her tendency to see the unity between figures. According to her, in the Vedic texts, there are many <i>dhisanas</i>, female spiritual figures who help and guide people, but they are all aspects of <i>Dhisana</i>, the unified feminine tutelary deity. Kvilhaug points out the etymological relationship of <i>dis</i> and <i>dhisana</i> and the shared characteristics (including an association with mead/soma) and argues that all of that suggests a common proto-Indo-European source. If they had a common source, then it's not that far-fetched to posit that the Vedic motif of "manifestations of a unified divinity" might not have been an innovation, but rather retained from that ancient common source. If so, then it's not nuts to think the Germanish folk had similar beliefs about the related deities. Again, I'm not totally sure I buy it, but it's at least plausible.

<div id="outline-container-org76ac978" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org76ac978">A Word on Reincarnation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org76ac978">
<p>
Kvilhaug takes it as given that at least some of the Eddic poems, including the so-called "heroic" poems, clearly and frankly discuss reincarnation. My own understanding is that it's a <i>bit</i> muddier than that, especially since it seems the clearest references to reincarnation are in prose notes that stitch together poem fragments and were written by Christian compilers - stuff like "back then, they had a superstition that the dead could be reborn into a new body, but we know better now." This is one of those areas where I wish for some more careful and fully-cited scholarship from Kvilhaug - what passages are you referring to? What are the arguments for and against your interpretation? Is this commonly accepted, or a fringe view? For all the problems with modern academia, the norm of trying to give a state of the field for contentious questions is an admirable one. Anyhow, let's set aside for a moment the strength of the textual or archaeological/historical evidence that the elder Germanish folk believed that a soul could come back into a new life (we'll also set aside <i>which</i> souls we're talking about, since the elder heathens believed that each of us had <a href="https://heathensoullore.net/">many</a>). If we do that, two questions come to mind: 1. why might we suppose a belief in reincarnation is a reasonable hypothesis? and 2. if we accept that hypothesis, what do the texts then say to us?
</p>

<p>
For the first question, I would point out that <i>some</i> flavor of metempsychosis seems to have been <i>very</i> widespread across many different ancient cultures. Sometimes only part of the "self" was believed to come back, and in others only some folks reincarnated, while others did not. I was shocked that when I <i>finally</i> (ahem, 2022) read all of Plato's <i>Republic</i>, I discovered that it ends with a detailed description of the process of reincarnation, told as if it's an eyewitness account. When I went looking for articles on the subject, it was funny, but also a bit sad, that all of these scholars were tying themselves in knots over "what could Plato have possibly <i>meant</i> by this weird section?" and not a one of them stopped to consider "maybe Plato/Socrates thought this was actually how things worked and it would be good to know." Pythagoras, the druids, certain Egyptians - lots of ancient folks outside of the Hindu/Buddhist sphere believed that after death, something of the self came back into new life, here in this world.
</p>

<p>
For the second, things start to get really interesting. Kvilhaug reads the sequence of heroic poems as the tale of a single reincarnating person learning what he needs to in order to reach enlightenment. The contrast between shades in Hell and bright, hearty warriors in Valhalla. The meaning of being born with your own norn and orlaeg (karma?). All of these take on <i>very</i> interesting implications if paired with a belief in reincarnation. Perhaps most interesting to me is the emphasis on "memory." Might it be that the reason memory was so valued in the myths was that a memory of your persistent individuality, rather than your transient personality, was the goal of esoteric spiritual work? To me, this seems to give a whole host of helpful bethinking threads, but whether it's "really how things are" is a question I'll have to stay quiet on for now.

<h3 id="org059eed9">Closing - Wide-Ranging References around a Central Idea Works Well for Kvilhaug</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org059eed9">
<p>
As I mentioned in the opening, I think that the fairly constrained topic of this chapter was a boon for Kvilhaug. She got to fare far and wide with her references and comparisons, but they always came back to this central idea of a maiden with magical mead, which gave everything a coherence and relevance that it has, at times, been harder to find in Kvilhaug's work. If the rest of the book works more like this - a fairly tight, coherent topic, with a lot of speculation around it - then I'll be quite happy. If not, well, I'm sure it will still be helpful nonetheless.

<b>Date</b>: 2023-September-10
</p>

<p>
The Librarian of Celaeno wrote a paean (?) to his home state of <a href="https://librarianofcelaeno.substack.com/p/tropical-somnium">Florida</a>, and it got me thinking about my own home, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILxuDZj-Px4">Texas</a>. I was born here, I have lived here most of my life, and I've always assumed it's where I want to stay for good, but I've been thinking about this assumption a bit lately. I thought writing out some of my thoughts might help me make things a bit clearer, to myself, at least. So, I've poured myself a Balcones Texas Rye, and we'll see where it takes me.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the Lone Star State has a certain mystique, or at least a certain reputation. Cowboys, horses, cattle, the Alamo, all of that. When we moved to Virginia when I was nine, I actually had kids ask me if I rode a horse to school (they were mostly making fun of me, but you could tell they weren't <i>really</i> sure I didn't). I don't have much of an accent, but they also made fun of me for saying "nekkid" and not making any distinction between "ten" and "tin" or "pen" and "pin." Teasing from the other kids aside, there wasn't much difference between the Dallas suburbs of my early childhood, the DC suburbs of northern Virginia, and the Houston suburbs we moved to in high school. Even still, at the University of Texas, I started wearing cowboy boots and a big belt buckle with a Texas star on it as I leaned into "Texan" as part of my identity, and I kept it up when I headed out to the Army (I was mildly disappointed no one ever called me "Tex" in the Army, but then, in the Army, everybody's from Texas). I didn't grow up in the country, I haven't ridden horses nearly as much as I'd like, and I'm not even in the oil industry, so I may not be the "archetypal Texan," but it's still my culture, and it's shaped who I am.
</p>

<p>
So, what even is "Texan culture" besides stereotypes about rodeos and barbecue? Don't get me wrong, those are part of it, especially here in Houston, but I <i>do</i> think there's such a thing as Texan culture, a way of approaching things, a way of seeing the world, that's not just "American" or "Southern" or some other bigger grouping. But how to describe it? Consider the mockingbird, the state bird of Texas. I once watched a squadron of mockingbirds drive off a cat with relentless dive-bombing. Likewise with ravens, hawks, and other big, dangerous critters. Mockingbirds are <i>mean as hell</i>. Now, I'm not saying Texans are mean. Most of us are pretty darn friendly. But we admire a certain cussed hardness, <i>especially</i> if it's for a good cause, like protecting your nest from predators that want to eat your kids. From time to time, I've run into folks who make fun of Texans for lionizing the Alamo and its defenders. <i>Hahah, don't you dumb hicks know you lost? You didn't even achieve anything strategic!</i> The folks who say these things are small-souled weasels. They likely sneer at Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans as well. The Alamo has been a legend for Texans ever since it happened, because a handful of scrappy men chose certain death over abandoning the sacred cause they had pledged themselves to.
</p>

<p>
Being Texan isn't all about grim self-sacrifice, though. We also value humor and open-handed generosity. For this one, I don't have so well-known a story, but instead, I want to tell you about Kyle. First off, you're likely reading that as "Kai-yull," but that was not his name. It was more like "Kahl," with just a <i>hint</i> of that "y" in there. I mentioned that I don't have much of a Texas accent, but when I was around Kyle, I did. It wasn't a matter of faking it or trying to put something on, rather, Kyle was such a <i>presence</i> that you couldn't help but be drawn in by his hyper-Texan gravitational field. Any Texanness you had in you <i>would</i> be brought out and strengthened. You know the stereotype of the larger-than-life Texas oilman? Well, then you know something about Kyle. First off, he really was <i>large</i> - he was at least six and a half feet tall and followed many a high school and college football player into putting on some weight once he stopped with the two-a-days but kept up a hearty appetite. He made his not inconsiderable fortune when he noticed a quirk of Texas law meant that pipelines under a certain length were not subject to the same tariff restrictions as most pipelines. He also noticed that some of the new off-shore rigs were within that distance, and he was Johnny on the spot to build the pipeline to get the oil from these rigs to refineries, a privilege for which he charged handsomely. All of which allowed him to own a working ranch, a private jet he loaned to the University of Texas football program for recruiting purposes, and much else besides. Now, all of this might leave you thinking he was somehow grasping or even greedy, but nothing could be farther from the truth. I don't know that I've ever met a more generous man. He wrote a recommendation letter for my sister to get into university and for me to get into business school. He gave regularly to his church and other charities. When I was home on leave before deploying to Iraq, he let me and my then-fiance stay at his lakehouse, drink his wine, ride his jet skis, and visit his country club's pool. From what close relationship did he feel called to do all this? He and my dad shared a cabin at a business development retreat. I've been focusing on the generosity, but it was the humor that this bond was built on - Kyle had my dad in stitches from day one. They almost missed breakfast multiple times because my dad was laughing too hard to get ready. In my dad's defense, Kyle also always found him hilarious and valued his insight. They hit it off and became good friends, but he was like this with <i>everyone</i>. Sure he made a lot of money, but it was never anything other than a way to make other people happy. Tragically, he was killed when someone side-swiped his predictably enormous Ford Expedition on the highway. Texas, and the world, are less without him.
</p>

<p>
These two examples I've gone through may seem unlinked, maybe even utterly at odds, but I think that understanding what holds them together gives an insight into the Texan soul. Unsurprisingly given our history, Texans have a very <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/">borderer notion of liberty</a> - "liberty" means something like "leave me alone to handle my own business." Sure, we've had many of the same ups and downs here as much of the rest of the country, but for a surprisingly long time, Texas has remained a place where folks can look out on wide vistas and say "if I can't have what I want here, maybe I can have it out there somewhere." That cussedness I mentioned isn't in service of God or country or some other big abstraction - or if it is, it's because <i>I</i> chose to serve that abstraction, and it's none of your damned business why. But likewise with the humor - I share what I think is funny about the world, and if it makes you laugh, well, hell, maybe we can be friends, but if not? No skin off my back. And even more so the generosity - what speaks to the autonomy that wealth can bring more than the ability and willingness to give it away however you damn well please. The beating heart of Texas culture is a respect for and a ferocious defense of a man's right to go his own way, and damn the consequences, because however it works out, it'll be a hell of a ride.
</p>

<p>
I've been singing the praises of Texan culture here, so whence my uncertainty? Well, I want to put down roots, and there's a few things that give me pause. First off, Texas is <i>big</i>, and most of it is pretty wide open. Combine that with the fact that most of Texas's growth has been after cars were introduced, and what you get is a lot of cities that are not walkable <i>at all</i>. Houston practically reviles its pedestrians. This is a town for cars. A big part of what makes much of Texas so very unwalkable is how very hot it is here. Yeah, yeah, we're Texans, we can take it, tough talk, and so forth, but man. This year, we had as many days with highs over 100 as have ever been recorded (tied with 2011), and that plain sucks. If folks are right that we have more of this on the way for the back half of my life, and for all of my girls' lives, is this really where we want to root ourselves? That's to say nothing of the worse predictions about sea levels - if much of the polar ice melts, a lot of Texas will be right back to the shallow sea that got us all of our oil, most definitely including Houston (my house is 75 feet above sea level and less than a mile from a bayou, so it wouldn't take much). Oh yeah, and that oil? That's a <i>huge</i> part of our economy. When the fracking boom drys up, and other bits of the oil industry begin to struggle, where will that leave our currently prosperous state? As I've mentioned before, I'm not exactly sanguine on what will happen to energy-intensive industrial economies, and much of current Texas life and economy depends <i>heavily</i> on that - Houston without air conditioning is a <i>very</i> different prospect than what we have now. I'd like to live somewhere that I can walk most places I need to go, use minimal energy to keep my home comfortable, and keep as much of my business local as I can. Right now, I don't know if anywhere in Texas fits that bill, and even if it does, I don't know whether it will stay that way for the next 40-80 years. And all of that's to say nothing about what might happen politically, geopolitically, and so forth - is it a plus or a minus that folks have "Secede" bumper stickers that are not <i>entirely</i> jokes? If the port of Houston stops shipping so much oil, how important does it remain? What happens if the Mexican drug cartels push more aggressively north of the border? I don't have good answers to any of this, and that's why I haven't made up my mind.
</p>

<p>
I started this piece hoping that writing things out would help me get clearer on what I ought to do. I'm not sure that I've done that, though I have remembered some of what I love about Texas and its folk. For now, my wife and I have good jobs within "reasonable" commutes (about half an hour of bumper-to-bumper driving to go less than 10 miles), my dad's a comparable distance away out in the further suburbs, and most of the rest of our family is within a three-hour drive, so I can't complain too much. My girls go to a daycare with teachers they like, we have good friends here in the city, and we have a nice house with a big yard, way more than we could afford in many places (including here if we bought now instead of ten years ago). We didn't come anywhere near flooding in Hurricane Harvey, and we've never had any wind damage from storms. All of which is to say, there's nothing <i>pressing</i>, and much that makes staying put the easier choice, so that's where I am right now. Still and all, once I've thought about it some more, talked it over with the family and such, we'll make a call.

<p>
A ways back, I posted the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#mark_of_the_wells">Mark of the Wells</a>. Since then, I've been using it pretty much every day in a handful of ways: going to or leaving from my stall (altar), before and after saying one or more longer prayers, and before and after rituals, like the Sphere of Protection or Grove ceremony from the <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>. I think it has worked pretty well, and I like the ritual of having a common opening and closing before and after every prayer - it adds a feeling of unity and continuity. That being said, after a few months, I noticed that the "Mark of the Wells" felt better as a closing than an opening - something about the length and the last line "Mighty tree unmatched." It feels like a blossoming of sorts, a nice outcome of the work done before. And so I found myself wondering what might make for a good opening prayer/self-blessing/gesture along similar lines.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, over the past few months, I've been working on bettering my bond with Thunor (Thor). Among other things, He hallows things - drinks to give to the Gods, steads to worship, and so forth. I wear a Thunor's Hammer necklace, and every time I put it on, I say a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#a_few_daily_prayers">short prayer</a> to "re-hallow" it. I see this as a way of reinforcing that my hammer is a holy symbol, and that it holds Thunor's power within it. At one point in that prayer, I say "thanks I give for mighty hallowing hammer," and I trace out the sign of the hammer over the hammer charm as I say it: I start at the top of the hammer, draw my hand down and say "mighty," go to the left and say "hallowing," and then to the right and say "hammer." All of this, combined with some experience meditating and praying led me to think "maybe I can do something with this."
</p>

<p>
The other main influence is a "Sign of the Hammer" given in <i>The Nine Doors of Midgard</i> by Edred Thorsson. There, he provides a way of making the Sign of the Hammer on the body, where you touch the forehead (third eye), down to the top of the sternum, then down to the solar plexus, up to the left shoulder, and across to the right shoulder, with either a different God/Goddess at each point, or else a different name of Odhinn. When I was playing around before starting using the "Mark of the Wells", I gave this prayer/self-blessing/gesture a try.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, thanks to all of this, along with some things I saw while scrying, I came up with a new opening gesture to use: the "Mark of the Hammer" (I spell this out below). What I've been doing for the past two or three weeks is opening with the "Mark of the Hammer", and then closing with the "Mark of the Wells". I like this, as the feeling of "completion" that comes with the "Mark of the Wells," feels great for closing out, and the "not quite complete" feeling of the "Mark of the Hammer" feels right for the opening. I think I'm on to something, at least for me. So, if these prayers are amenable to your practice, I encourage you to give them a try, and I look forward to hearing how they're going. For the gestures below, I use my index and middle finger, and I touch before saying each line.

<i>A quick word on spelling: since I am a lazy typist, I will not be using vowels with any diacritics in this post, nor will I use the letters eth and thorn. Instead, I will use plain vowels, for thorn I will write "th" and for eth I will write "dh." I will also try to write the Old Norse nominative form, even when the word is technically genitive in the sentence (like "Odhinn's"), since it doesn't make sense to me to partially decline nouns in a language I don't know! However, I maybe a bit inconsistent about this, so please bear with me.</i>
</p>

<p>
Whoo boy, this was a looong chapter - 145 pages. This chapter was as long as her whole book <i>Idhunn in Myth and Poetry</i>. So that's why it's taken me a while to get this posted after our nice, bite-sized chapter 1. Looking forward, the next-longest chapter is about half that. I filled up 16 4x6 index cards (one side) with notes! At any rate, I think the reason this one is so long is that it lays a lot of groundwork she'll be referring back to as the book goes on. As you might guess from the name, it focuses on the creation of the cosmos, mostly as told in <i>Voluspa</i>, but it ranges fairly widely from there. As I mentioned in my last post on this book, organization and structure are not exactly Kvilhaug's strong suit, which was somewhat frustrating. While reading this chapter, I often found myself wishing it had instead been written as a stanza-by-stanza commentary on <i>Voluspa</i>, since that would have given it a firm skeleton to flesh out. As it is, the chapter <i>very</i> roughly proceeds from "In the beginning" to the world as it is/was for the audience of <i>Voluspa</i>. On the other hand, Kvilhaug takes the lore seriously and does a lot to highlight what is deep and spiritually significant in it, so it was worth it to wade through.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org79ece6b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79ece6b">The First Deeds of Making</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79ece6b">
<p>
So, if you didn't already know, <i>Voluspa</i> is arguably the single most important Eddic poem, certainly the one that gives the clearest understanding of elder take on cosmology. Its name means "The speech of the <i>volva</i> ('witch/seeress')." Odhinn calls this <i>volva</i> back from the dead to learn what she has to say, and most of the poem is her telling what she knows. 
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug dives right into things by giving a detailed analysis of the first words of her speech: <i>Ár var alda</i>. This is apparently a stock phrase that came to mean more or less "once upon a time." It's usually translated as something like "Of old was the age" or "it was at the very beginning" or "in earliest times." Kvilhaug argues that these are misunderstandings and lays out her case that it actually says "before was wave," and thus he preferred translation is "In the beginning was the wave." She connects this idea with the sea giant Aegir and his daughters the waves (more on this in a minute). She believes that Aegir and his wife Ran represent the mother and father of the cosmos. This is also one of the places where she brings up potentially intriguing parallels with modern science, in this case something about the big bang and vortices. Mostly I find such discussions somewhere between unhelpful and annoying amongst spiritual matters - to me it smacks of trying to borrow legitimacy from science for something that ought to be given legitimacy on its own merits.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, remember how I mentioned that this cosmological poem is the speech of the seeress? Well, who is this seeress anyway? We don't <i>truly</i> know, but she says that she "remembers" all of the things from the beginning that she tells of. Kvilhaug offers several possibilities: Freyja, Ran, Jordh, maybe even Audhumbla, the cosmic cow that freed Odhinn's grandfather Buri from the ice. This gets us to one of my critiques of Kvilhaug's approach that I touched on in the first post of this series: she tends to look at figures in the poems mostly as metaphors and symbols meant to convey esoteric spiritual insights. Now, that alone I don't have a problem with - in fact, I find it very helpful. Rather, when you put that together with her pantheist viewpoint, that all of these figures are manifestations of the same underlying spiritual unity, you get a tendency to speculate that two (or three, or more) figures from the lore are "the same." She has a point that the Old Norse lore is full of roundabout ways of talking about things - again, as we said last time, that was one of the <i>main points</i> of that kind of poetry. That means that sometimes, yes, one figure is the same as another (for example, I find the equation of Gullveig and Freyja convincing), but I think Kvilhaug is a bit too cavalier about it.
</p>

<p>
This tendency to equate figures gets into some wider issues in heathenry. The first is what is sometimes called "soft vs hard polytheism." I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LSd3iLCUtU">discussion</a> by Ocean Keltoi helpful for laying out this debate. Basically, at the extreme ends, "hard" polytheists treat each distinct divine name as a different Being - Odhinn is not the same as Woden is not the same as Wotan. "Soft" polytheists (well, using the definition from the video) believe the opposite: Odhinn, Woden, and Wotan are in some sense "the same." Different soft polytheists take this to different extremes - some say that Mars is the same as Tiw, due to the intepretatio Romana of the German Gods (see the days of the week). At the extreme end, you have pantheists who believe that all of the names refer to different experiences of the same, single divine reality. Now, heathens decide how soft or hard to make their polytheism based on some combination of <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/">gnosis and episteme</a>. On the episteme side of things, you have folks study the lore, look for commonalities and distinctions between Gods and decide logically whether they're the same or different. Often, this is informed by archaeological evidence, comparative mythology, and other sources. Broadly, this is called "reconstruction," and all modern revivals of pre-Christian religions engages in it to some degree, but some folks put much more emphasis on "getting it the way it was back then." This gets into the contrast between <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_trouble_with_authenticity">authenticity and validity we talked about</a>. In the heathen community, broadly speaking, the stricter the reconstructionist, the harder the polytheism. Gnosis, on the other hand, is all about personal experience, and by its nature can't be verified or confirmed by others. Again, everyone who takes religion seriously uses gnosis to some degree - what feels right, which Gods to pray to more or less, how to word those prayers, and so forth. Again, to speak very broadly, the more folks lean on gnosis, the more likely their beliefs and practices are quirkier. Since pantheism doesn't seem to be attested in the surviving lore, at least not straightforwardly, its looked at as quirkier by many heathens.
</p>

<p>
I guess a word about my own beliefs is in order to give some context for my comments. As I learned from <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#a_quick_grounding_in_revival_druidry">Revival Druidry</a>, I try to focus more on what I <i>do</i> than on what I <i>believe</i>. That being said, I have some working hypotheses based on the spiritual traditions I have found helpful and nourishing so far. The Druid tradition I am working with currently teaches what is basically a flavor of Neoplatonist metaphysics - everything that exists is a manifestation of a unified ground of being. In some sense this is "pantheist," but the key distinction is that this "One" is not personified - personhood shows up at lower levels of manifestation. Those distinct manifestations matter - in some sense, every river, lake, and sea is "the same water" - but if you think it doesn't make a difference whether you're on Lake Erie, going over Niagara Falls, or in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during a storm, you're gonna have a bad time. I think manifestation is something like this - in some sense, the unity of all things is a deep and important truth, but the different manifestations are an essential part of being here and now, and ignoring or denying them is a mistake. All of which is to say that I think in <i>some</i> sense Odhinn and Freyja and Ymir and all the rest are manifestations of a spiritual unity, but they are also genuinely different Beings. Again, <i>some</i> different names apply to the same Being (Odhinn, Vili, and Ve are <i>likely</i> the same as at least one of the other groups of three Gods - most likely Odhinn, Hoenir, and Lodhurr), but due to my own tendency to rationalize things and some of my own gnosis, I have adopted a rule to assume that Gods, wights, and other spiritual beings with distinct names, traditions, and so forth are different until proven the same. For example, back when I thought all this stuff was "just archetypes," I was intellectually convinced by the argument that Frigg and Freyja were once the same Goddess and at some fairly late point they had diverged into being treated as two Goddesses. Since there was no evidence of this divergence in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, when I started worshiping for real, I assumed that what the Norse call "Freyja" and "Frigg" were just different aspects of the same Goddess, and I prayed as such. Well, before too long, I got a pretty distinct feeling that I was doing it wrong and I should instead pray to two different Goddesses, and that has seemed to go better for me. So, are They "really" different Goddesses? Have They always been? I don't know! I just know what works for my practice. Anyway, all of that is to say that I think Kvilhaug is a little <i>too</i> ready to assert that two Gods are "the same" and pays more attention to possible similarities, shared identities, and parallels than to distinctions.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's get back to how the cosmos came to be. The first Being to arise in this cosmos is Ymir. Kvilhaug gives his name as "shout" or "noise," which <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ymir#Old_Norse">wiktionary</a> says is a folk etymology - it seems the accepted scholarly etymology takes it back to the Proto-Indo-European word for "twin," which is at least a little bit based on comparative mythology, as it seems the myth of a being getting killed having its body used to make the world seems to go way back, and the earliest version might have involved a twin getting killed by his brother. Anyway, Kvilhaug makes much of Ymir as sound, and the idea of "cutting up" sound into small bits as an act of creation is intriguing - what do you think words are? Even if that etymology is not right, Kvilhaug would likely counter that Norse poetry is full of puns, not always for comedic effect, so Ymir "sounding like" it should mean something to do with sound might very well have been the poet's intent, even if that's not truly where the name came from.
</p>

<p>
The other first Being spoken of is Audhumbla, a cow. She licks the ice of Niflheim for her sustenance and makes milk that Ymir lives on. There's some indication that Ymir was hermaphroditic (he begets the race of frost giants all by himself), but we have here the first pair of a masculine Being and a feminine one, which you'll remember from part 1 is an important symbolic dimension in Kvilhaug's analysis. Women seem to represent the hidden causes of things, that which acts but can't be seen. Men represent the obvious, overt causes of things. This is also the first instance where we see a feminine figure associated with a life-giving liquid, which is what you might call a recurring theme in the poetry (in case you missed it, that's wry understatement, folks). One bit of Kvilhaug's analysis I very much appreciate is how she points out recurrent themes or motifs, and the central role such recurrence plays in the creation story. One way of reading the <i>Voluspa</i>, which Kvilhaug makes use of and I agree is helpful, is as a series of iterations playing out at different scales. You have the first, primal interaction of hot, alive, moving and cold, dead, still where Niflheim and Muspelheim interact, but then you have the same dynamic seen in the first Beings, the first Gods, the first man and woman, and so forth. Oh, and besides the milk that she makes, Kvilhaug also translates Audhumbla's name as "Abundant Brew Ingredient" - another link with holy and/or life-giving drink.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug even takes this iteration a step further, in a concept almost certainly inspired by her study of Hindu myth, where she states that our cosmos is not the first, but rather follows on the heels of many (nine, according to some of the poems). When I first heard her make this claim, I thought it was interesting but likely highly speculative. Having read more of her arguments, I'm finding it a lot more plausible than I did at first. While she brings in many bits and pieces of evidence scattered around various myths, let me share what I think are the most compelling ones. First, the volva herself was around, but possibly already dead, when the first deeds of creation happened. Maybe she was a spirit from the previous world? Speaking of which, one of the first two worlds, Niflheim, is also the realm of the dead. Kvilhaug asserts that it is the realm of the dead left over from the previous cosmos - and so brings with it at least one of its spirits (the volva). Also intriguing is Buri, the ancestor of the Aesir, who is uncovered within the ice by Audhumbla's licking. Kvilhaug translates his name as "storage chest" and posits that he is the surviving but dormant seed of consciousness from the previous cosmos. This is not so crazy when we look forward to the description of Ragnarok, which tells of a rebirth under new Gods after the end of this world as we know it. Lastly, a major focus for Kvilhaug is Heimdall, and here she points to his 9 mothers. She believes that Heimdall means "Great World" and that he is the personification of this iteration of the cosmos, and his 9 mothers are feminine spirit of the 9 previous cosmoi. I'm not wholly convinced this for sure, but as I say, it's thought-stirring.
</p>

<p>
Another thought-stirring concept of Kvilhaug's that I'm still sitting with is the role she sees for dwarves (thou shalt spell the plural "dwarves," not "dwarfs," <a href="https://youtu.be/CWrMGXwhFLk?t=166">regardless of what the Oxford English Dictionary tells you</a>). She sees the dwarves of the <i>Voluspa</i> as distinct from the smiths, craftsmen, and similar characters from other tales. Those more familiar dwarves have some link (might be the same as) the dark elves, and like elves, likely have some link with the spirits of the dead and the mounds where they are buried. The <i>Voluspa</i> dwarves, though, don't seem to have much to do with all that. Instead, they are introduced right before the creation of man and are linked both with men and with the Gods. The list of dwarves, the <i>dvergatal</i> has long confused scholars, many seeing it is a later insertion, basically a scribal error by folks who didn't understand what they were copying. Maybe. But Kvilhaug says instead that the list of dwarves is saying something through the names (there they are again!). The dwarves are said to have made "the images of men," and some of the "dwarves" referred to seem like they might be other names for figures we've met elsewhere, like Ymir and Odhinn. So, what are they? Kvilhaug says that the dwarves are <i>shapes</i> or <i>forms</i> that are taken on by the infinite spiritual powers that made the cosmos so that they might act within it. The etymology of Norse <i>dvergr</i>  (and English dwarf, for that matter) has something to do with injury or mutilation or being twisted. Kvilhaug thinks that this speaks to the limitation taken on by things like souls or pure consciousness in order to manifest in the cosmos. As I said, I'm still chewing on this one, but it's a heck of an interesting take.
</p>

<p>
Okay, I mentioned Kvilhaug's belief that Aegir and Ran, as the Giant and Giantess of the sea are somehow the mother and father of all of creation. Her thought is that they are the Gods of the "cosmic sea," the liquidy unmanifest potential in which the "waves" of creation act. She pulls in a lot of cross-references here, and again, I'm going to have to think some more on it. What's intriguing is that she suggests that Njordhr might be the same as Aegir, and thus Ran would be the same as Nerthus. Njordhr is also associated with the sea, the name of his divine abode has much in common with how Aegir's home is described, and Nerthus was also associated both with plenty and feasting as well as with drowning. Also, Aegir is said to have 9 daughters, usually thought to be the waves of the sea, and in <i>Solarliodh</i>, Njordhr is said to have nine daughters. Also, in <i>Lokasenna</i>, Loki taunts Njordhr for having the nine "Maidens of Hymir" use his mouth as a piss pot (yuck), but Njordhr responds "that's how I got my son that everybody loves (Freyr)." Given the strong associations with incestuous relationships in this family (Freyr and Freyja are sometimes said to be lovers, in <i>Ynglinga Saga</i>, Njordhr was said to leave his sister-wife behind when he came to live with the Aesir, and so forth), the idea that those nine maidens are his daughters and the mothers of their brother is not <i>that</i> far-fetched, but for me, this is still firmly in the "interesting speculation" category.
</p>

<p>
One last thought for this bit is that I wish Kvilhaug showed some familiarity with Paul Bauschatz's <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_the_well_and_the_tree">The Well and the Tree</a>. She has a lot to say about fate, the Norns, and the conception of the World Tree, and it would be nice to see how she agreed or differed from him on such things. This is one of the many places where I'm realizing that the synthesis I wish I had to read likely doesn't exist, and I'm going to have to do the work myself. Hence these posts!

<h3 id="org5fd2e47">As Above, So Below - Creation Models Initiation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5fd2e47">
<p>
One of Kvilhaug's main threads, maybe <i>the</i> main thread, is that the Eddic poems convey esoteric, initiatory knowledge about the soul and its development. As such, she sees the creation of the cosmos as laying certain foundations and providing the earliest archetypes of certain spiritual models. First is the framing of <i>Voluspa</i>: a speech by a <i>volva</i>, someone who does the kind of magic called <i>seidhr</i>. Seidhr seems mostly to have been divinatory in nature, but might also have had other powers. Kvilhaug lays it out like this: seidhr is about knowing (and thus being able to change) fate. The fate of all humans is death. Therefore, the goal of seidhr must be to overcome death (in some sense, at least). Sounds easy, right? Well, Kvilhaug says that basically all of the Eddic poems are trying to get across different aspects of these secrets, along with different approaches (seidhr is not right for everyone). The very first user of seidhr was the witch Gullveig. Interestingly, Gullveig is <i>not</i> mentioned by Snorri, and neither is Odhinn's self-sacrifice in <i>Havamal</i>. Kvilhaug thinks it is because these were clearly magical, heathen initiations, and were thus more likely to draw the ire of the Church. In any case, Gullveig's name is usually translated as "Gold Thirst/Lust," and is taken to mean greed. She comes to the Aesir from the Vanir, does some magic, and then they try to kill her by stabbing and burning her. Three times they try it, and three times she comes back. Most interpretations say that she showed up, started causing strife through greed, stirred things up with her wicked magic, and otherwise instigated the Aesir-Vanir war.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug says this is all wrong. All that about causing trouble? Not in the poem. It's inferred from the name, which Kvilhaug thinks most scholars get wrong. Gull is clearly "gold," but the "veig" bit that is usually translated as "thirst" seems to more commonly mean "(powerful) drink." Given the <i>very</i> widespread association of wise, magical women with "golden drinks" in the lore, Kvilhaug thinks her name more likely means "Gold Power Drink." Most of the time that gold shows up in the poems, Kvilhaug claims, it's not associated with greed or strife (with the notable exception of the Rhine Gold, I would point out), but instead seems to be a metaphor for divine wisdom, the prize you get for following your initiatory journey. This all seems even more likely if we accept that Gullveig is likely another name for Freyja, who is said elsewhere to have brought seidhr to the Aesir, is a prominent figure in the Vanir, and comes to dwell with the Aesir, as well as being associated with magic, drinks, and initiation.
</p>

<p>
The necessary precondition for all of this initiation is, of course, consciousness, and much of <i>Voluspa</i> seems to be about how consciousness came into the world and found its way into different beings there. First off, the first glimmer of divine consciousness (if you don't assign it to Ymir or Audhumbla) is a remnant from the earlier cosmos - Buri being unearthed from the ice. Here, and elsewhere, whenever we come across personified consciousness, it has three qualities - Spirit, Mind/Poetry/Awe, and Passion/Frenzy/Intent. As personified by Odhinn, Vili, Ve, these shaped the whole cosmos. As personified by Odhinn, Hoenir, and Lodhurr, they created the first man and woman. So, these are somehow fundamental to what it is to be a conscious being, and we see them show up a lot - the three Gods, usually representing these three characteristics, are one of the "formulae" Kvilhaug uses as a key to her analysis. One that she pointed out that I found interesting, and assume we'll hear more about when we get to Ragnarok is how the trinity of Odhinn, Thorr, and Freyr is opposed by a male trio of monsters: Fenrir, Jormungandr, and Surtr.
</p>

<p>
Another bit that I have found interesting to consider and comes straight out of Kvilhaug's focus on translating names. Hoenir shows up in a few places that would seem to suggest he's rather important, but then he doesn't do a lot. He <i>might</i> be the same as Ve, in which case he helped kill Ymir and make the world. He gives one of the gifts to the first man and woman that make them more than lumps of driftwood. In Ynglinga saga, he is said to be one of the hostages sent by the Aesir to the Vanir, along with Mimir, and they're so impressed by him, they make him their king. After a time, though, they notice he needs to talk to Mimir ("memory") to decide anything and becomes indecisive without Him around. Thinking he's a fake, they kill Mimir, but Odhinn saves his head and preserves it to whisper wisdom to Him. Anyway, what does the name <i>Hoenir</i> mean? Kvilhaug says it's pretty clearly "chickens," but that this has seemed so undignified and nonsensical for one of the creators of the universe that scholars have tried to find all kinds of other meanings. She says, hold on, maybe it's exactly what it looks like. the gift that Hoenir gives to mankind is <i>thought</i>, and Kvilhaug compares the chattering, shuffling, mess of thinking with a flock of chickens - what Buddhists might call "monkey mind." If we accept that Hoenir is/is associated with "thought," then the fact that he is paired with Mimir ("memory") suggests a comparison with Odhinn's ravens Huginn ("thought") and Muninn ("Memory") - which I was embarrassed not to have thought of on my own.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Mimir, he is sometimes said to be a giant, and there's a reasonable case to be made that he's Odhinn's maternal uncle. From Snorri and <i>Havamal</i>, we know that Odhinn gave an eye to get a drink of the Mead of Memory from Mimir's Well. There are a lot of places where giants or giantesses act as the gatekeeper for initiatory experiences, which seems a bit odd, since the giants are usually characterized as enemies of the Gods, and Snorri says flat out they're evil. Kvilhaug thinks this is a Christian misinterpretation, and says instead giants (and often, giantesses) are best thought of as challenges or obstacles to be overcome, and in the overcoming, you become worthy. Shani Oates puts a characteristically antagonistic spin on this in <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_the_hanged_god">The Hanged God</a>, where she sees Odhinn's initiation by Mimir culminating in defeating him in combat and cutting his head off himself, rather than saving it from the Vanir. I think there is definitely something here, but I also think there's something to "giants = enemies of the Gods," given how every Indo-European religion we know about has a race of (semi?) divine beings that the Gods fight (but also marry and otherwise interact with). I don't have a good answer here, but I wonder if a very close reading of the different terms that usually get translated as "giant" might reveal some patterns. Oh, and Kvilhaug says "we know that giantesses were worshiped," but she doesn't say how we know that - written records? archaeology? place names? I believe her, but I'd like to know the nature of the evidence.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned earlier how Kvilhaug sometimes tries to link the myths to science, and how mostly I think that's a waste. She does that with Thorr as the protector of his mother, Jordhr ("Earth"), which she speculates could be a reflection of knowledge of the Earth's magnetic field. She also points out his metal belt and gloves and how they could have something to do with electrical circuits. All of which didn't do much for me, but in that bit, she gave a potential interpretation for Thorr's wife Sif that I hadn't seen before. Her name just means "kinswoman" (same root as English "sib" as in "sibling"), and with her golden hair, she is often seen as the grain (especially with the story of Loki cutting it off). Kvilhaug suggests that another golden thing closely associated with thunder is, you know, <i>lightning</i>. I'm not sure if I buy it, or if I do, what that means, but interesting!
</p>

<p>
One area where I had enough knowledge to see some misunderstanding/sloppiness was when she talks about Runes. Now, she gets the main idea right: "Rune" means "secret," and in the lore it doesn't <i>only</i> mean Runestaves - letters. For example, the list of "Runes" Odhinn gives in <i>Havamal</i> is clearly not the letters of the Elder or Younger Futhark. But there are places where Runes are "carved," (including in <i>Havamal</i>), and so Runestaves are also clearly relevant. The Runes are an especial interest of mine, the first thing that drew me to magical practice of any kind, actually, so I've done a fair amount of reading, meditating, and my own work here (though there's far more to go!). So, when Kvilhaug says "folks ask me about divining with runes and I don't know anything about that," but then also goes on to quote Tacitus's description of Germans of the 1st century CE doing some kind of sortilege as if it <i>definitely</i> describes divining with Runes, it's a bit frustrating, and makes me wary about other places where she just asserts something is so and doesn't say what her back up for it is. If you're not familiar, Tacticus says that Germans cast lots to decide whether to pursue a course of action all the time. He describes the process in some detail: cut a branch from a fruit-bearing tree, cut that into lots, and then carve "marks" into the lots (Kvilhog translates "marks" as "Runes," which is definitely <i>not</i> what the Latin said!). Were those marks Runestaves or proto-Runestaves? Maybe. Did the elder Heathens use Runestaves for some kind of divination by the Viking Age? Seems fairly likely, but we can't say for sure. Are modern methods of divination with Runestaves what folks did back then? Almost certainly not. But they work! Once again, validity versus authenticity.

<h3 id="seed_of_yggdrasill_2_the_world_tree">The World Tree</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-seed_of_yggdrasill_2_the_world_tree">
<p>
The World Tree is a topic of no small interest to me, as it is central to the work I'm doing on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>. I think it is one of the deepest and most important esoteric symbols in the lore, so I'm always eager to learn new ways of thinking about it. Kvilhaug especially stresses the World Tree as a macrocosm that is clearly linked with the microcosm of the human body - trees are frequent kennings for men and women, the first man and woman are made from wood, and the first man is named <i>Askr</i>, which means "ash (tree)." Humans are linked with and depicted as trees all over the place, so Kvilhaug thinks that characterizing the cosmos as a tree is meant to draw attention to the similarities between the individual human and the cosmos (as we said in the last bit - "as above, so below"). If you're familiar with the lore, you might have noticed that I mentioned the first <i>man</i> has the name of a tree, but I didn't say anything about the first woman, <i>Embla</i>. Her name has given folks a lot of trouble - some try to render it as an unfamiliar form of "Elm," since a matched pair of trees makes sense for all the reasons I mentioned above. On the other hand, that's apparently not altogether satisfying. Neither is trying to derive it from the Greek <i>ampelos</i> ("vine"). Neither, really is <i>eim</i> + <i>la</i> for "firemakeress" or <i>amr</i> meaning "hard work." Can you guess where Kvilhaug goes with it? That's right, she sees it as a modification of <i>Humbla</i> "Brew Ingredient," which we found in her translation for Audhumbla above. This fits into he general pattern of seeing masculine as the outward, shaping, organizing influence, and feminine as inner, liquid, enlivening influence. This is one (of many) cases where I wish I had the kind of deep knowledge of Old Norse and Proto-Germanic that would let me tell the difference between reasonable etymology proposals and fanciful ones. As it is, I just have to read the arguments put forth by the folks who try to work it out and see what makes most sense.
</p>

<p>
To get to the World Tree itself, Kvilhaug translates is usual name, <i>Yggdrasill</i>, as "Old Steed," and stresses that in some sense, the world is the "steed" of souls who enter it, carrying them along their path of incarnation and, possibly, initiation. That name is more often translated as "The Steed of the Terrible One," where <i>Yggr</i> "The Terrible" is taken as a heiti for Odhinn (another case where I wish I could evaluate the plausibility more on my own). It is also called the <i>Miodhvidhr</i> ("Mead Tree") and <i>Mimameidhr</i> ("Memory Tree"). Snorri gives it three roots, each drawing from a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#mark_of_the_wells">different well</a> - <i>Urdharbrunnr</i> ("The Well of Wyrd/Origin"), <i>Hvergelmir</i> ("Yelling/Churning Boiler"), and <i>Mimisbrunnr</i> ("Mimir's Well"). So, from the names and the roots, we know that the Tree is linked to the magic liquid(s) important from multiple myths, as well as at least some of the qualities of mind (memory). The creatures that live in the tree give more clues to what the World Tree is about - near the top sits a huge eagle, <i>Hraesvelgr</i> ("Corpse Swallower"), with Falcon on his brow, <i>Vethrfolnir</i> ("Wind Diminisher"). Kvilhaug says over and over again that "winds" are usually a metaphor for mortality and death in the Eddic poems. I'm not sure if that's widely accepted, or a piece of her own analysis, but it seems to make good sense (a lot of divine dwelling places are called "wind-shielded" or "windless," places full of death are "windy," and stuff like this eagle-falcon pair), <i>Niddhoggr</i> ("Malice(?) Striker") chews on the roots, <i>Ratatoskr</i> (usually given as "Drill Tooth," but Kvilhaug says "moving container") carriers messages from the snake to the eagle, the stag <i>Eikthrynir</i> ("Oak Antlers"), and the goat <i>Heidhrun</i> ("Bright Rune") chew on the leaves. Kvilhaug proposes a parallel to the chakras of Tantric practice, seeing <i>Niddhoggr</i> as the kundalini, <i>Hraesvelgr</i> as the spirit, and <i>Vethrfolnir</i> as the third eye. I'm not sure about the tantric comparison, but the other explanations are certainly compelling. One element she stressed that I think will be worth more careful thought is that <i>Eikthrynir</i> and <i>Heidhrun</i> both chew on the leaves of the World Tree, which might represent human souls, and then release a liquid - the stag drips liquid from his antlers down into <i>Hvergelmir</i>, the well of the land of the dead, whereas <i>Heidhrun</i> makes mead for milk, which becomes the drink of Odhinn's chosen in <i>Valholl</i>. Kvilhaug proposes that this symbolizes how un-initiated souls fall back down into Hel (for reincarnation later), whereas those that achieve divine knowledge escape from this cycle to the immortality of <i>Valholl</i>. I trust there will be much more on these topics when she gets more explicitly into discussing reincarnation in later chapters.

<div id="outline-container-org9d4798a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9d4798a">The Soul</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9d4798a">
<p>
Okay, one of the ares of Kvilhaug's thought that I struggle with the most is when she starts talking about "the soul." For example, her conclusion to <i>The Goddess Idhunn in Myth and Poetry</i> is that Idhunn is "the soul of all the Gods." I don't really know what that means, but maybe it's because I'm not grokking her flavor of pantheism. There are similarly confusing things when she gets to discussing individual human souls. This is further complicated by the fact that the Old Germanish folks seem to not have believed in one soul per person. Instead, each person had many souls, each of which handled different bits of we today are used to thinking of as a unity. This is an area <a href="https://heathensoullore.net/heathen-soul-lore-foundations-book/">I need to study more</a>, as I think it's very weird, very interesting, and potentially very spiritually fruitful. Complicating things <i>still further</i> is Kvilhaug's tendency we noted earlier to highlight similarities and try to equate things - so are Norns, Valkyries, Swanmays, Fylgur, and Hamingjur all different things? The same thing? Distinct but related? Honestly, I came away still confused on what exactly Kvilhaug is saying about these Beings, other than that they have some things in common and might sometimes (always?) be "the same" - for example, maybe Valkyries are just the personal Norns of those found worthy by Odhinn. Personal Norns? That's right, besides the three "main" Norns, <i>Urdhr</i> ("Origin"), <i>Verdhandi</i> ("Becoming"), and <i>Skuld</i> ("Debt, Obligation"), it seems each individual had a personal Norn (or maybe a whole set of them?). Snorri tells us that these could be of different kinds - As-Kind, Elf-Kind, and Dwarf-Kind, and that the kind of Norn determined what would happen in life. Folks were also thought to have a <i>fylgja</i>, which is usually translated "follower," which was a helpful feminine spirit that might also (sometimes) be an animal. Clan leaders were said to have a Clan Fylgja. These were sometimes believed to be/be associated with female ancestors. <i>Hamingjur</i> are another (usually feminine) being/part of the soul that seem to be associated with luck and magical power and <i>might</i> be the same spiritual entity as the <i>fylgja</i> but described differently due to what its doing functionally. Again, all kind of hard to say, and I didn't find this as helpful in sorting this out as I would have liked. Oh, and if all of these beings are feminine, what of the masculine side of the soul? Well, that's (maybe) what elves are - masculine spirits/bits of the soul that have <i>something</i> to do with ancestors. Anyhow, I suspect we'll be coming back to all of this more as we go, but I'm not sure whether my confusion about what Kvilhaug is trying to convey will clear up or not - but I suppose finding out is the adventure we're on.

<h3 id="orga55df42">Shamanic Parallels</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga55df42">
<p>
One area I found very interesting was when Kvilhaug talked about some of the similarities between the beliefs of various circumpolar peoples with shamanic traditions, such as the Sami and some folks of Siberia, with Germanish beliefs.
That's another work on my wishlist for someone to do so I can read it: a thorough, wide-ranging comparison of what we know about historical shamanic beliefs and practices and those Germanish beliefs and practices that seem similar. You see bits and pieces of it here and there, but I've yet to see something thorough and all in one place. Kvilhaug shares how the Sami and some Siberian folks believed that the Sun lived in a blessed realm in the south, next to a rejuvenating source of water at the foot of the world tree, and that the souls of humans fly from there at birth and back there at death in the shape of water birds like swans or ducks. To say that these characteristics are strikingly similar to much of what we find in the Old Norse poems is a bit of an understatement. Whence the similarities? Well, the more obvious (and likely the more likely) origin is the fact that the Germanish folk were neighbors with these circumpolar folks for a very long time - from what we can tell, it seems like the Proto-Germanish language came to be in what are now the Nordic countries during the Nordic Bronze Age of ~2000 - 500 BCE. The Sami and the Finns are very likely descended from the folk who lived in those lands before the ancestors of the Proto-Germanish folks showed up. We know there was a lot of contact and a lot of exchange - for example, the ancient Finns seem to have started worshiping a hammer-wielding sky God not long after the Proto-Germans showed up. On the other hand, there's a more far-fetched, but thus more potentially exciting theory, laid out pretty clearly in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">The World's Oldest Myth?</a> Now, Tom Rowsell expresses it with fewer qualifications and cautions than I might prefer, but that's likely mostly to make for compelling film. Anyhow, the main consensus view of "who were the Proto-Indo-Europeans" these days is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamnaya_culture">Yamnaya archaeological culture</a> (see <a href="https://nemets.substack.com/p/proto-indo-european-urheimat-debate">here</a> for a good, even-handed discussion of the top three theories). From ancient DNA samples, we know that the folks of the Yamnaya archaeological culture came from a merger of three main populations: the Eastern Hunter Gatherers (EHG), Early European Farmers (EEF), and Ancient Northern Eurasians (ANE). Here's where the story gets interesting. You know who else is partially descended from the ANE group (which originated in modern Siberia)? Many of the circumpolar folks and American Indians. Now, the DNA by itself doesn't prove anything, but amongst folks with this shared ancestry, you often find beliefs about the world and the afterlife that are weirdly similar. The land of the dead has some kind of body of water, is guarded by (a) dog(s), has a tree that is the world growing out of it, and is ruled by woman who is both scary and beneficial. Not all of those elements show up together in every case, but often at least two of them cluster together and are <i>very</i> widely dispersed with no intervening contact since a very, very long time ago. That suggests that some of these beliefs might be <i>insanely</i> old - like, 24,000 years old, <i>at least</i>. Almost impossible to say for sure, of course, but it's like catnip to someone like me who is fascinated by the hazy borders of what we can know about the past.

So, whoo, here we are. The next chapter is, as I said, mercifully shorter, and focuses on "The Maiden with the Mead," the subject of Kvilhaug's master's thesis, but apparently new work on the same topic here. So, expect lots more on feminine spiritual Beings and/or bits of the soul, magic drinks, and initiation. As always, I welcome any thoughts, recommendations, or corrections.

<b>Date</b>: 2023-August-20
</p>

<p>
I just wrapped up reading the four-part <i>Book of the New Sun</i> and its sequel, <i>The Urth of the New Sun</i> by Gene Wolfe. These were my first Wolfe books, and I hadn't heard much about the series, so I didn't really know what to look for going in. Having read it, I can now safely say both say it's very good and rather weird. I'll have to get into spoilers to talk about much of what makes these books interesting and worthwhile, but I'll give a shorter rundown without any spoilers first.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6b3bee7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6b3bee7">A Quick Word on the Books and What I'll Be Calling Them</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6b3bee7">
<p>
The series <i>The Book of the New Sun</i> was first published as four books: <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i>, <i>The Claw of the Conciliator</i>, <i>The Sword of the Lictor</i>, and <i>The Citadel of the Autarch</i>. Later, Wolfe wrote a follow-up called <i>The Urth of the New Sun</i>, but pretty much everyone was like "okay, what we have now is just a five-book series." What might also trip you up if you go to buy these books is that these days, you're most likely to find them in three volumes: <i>Shadow and Claw</i>, <i>Sword and Citadel</i>, and <i>The Urth of the New Sun</i>. Even though <i>technically</i>, "The Book of the New Sun" only means the first four books, I'm going to use it to mean all five, and for this post, I'll be shortening that to BNS. Also worth marking, while we're talking about these books is that Wolfe wrote <i>another</i> series set in the same future called <i>The Book of the</i> [ahem] <i>Long Sun</i>, but I haven't read that one, so any thoughts on that will have to wait. Michael Andre-Driussi, a (wonderfully) obsessive fan, also compiled, with Wolfe's blessing and sometimes help, <i>The Lexicon Urthus</i>, which is a dictionary of many of the strange words and characters of all of these books, but beware: thar be spoilers aplenty in that thar book. Andre-Driussi came up with "The Urth Cycle" for all of the books and stories set in this future, but I won't be using that name, since it casts a wider net than I'll be talking about today.

<h3 id="orgba8d79a">Spoiler-Free Rundown</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgba8d79a">
<p>
I can say without spoilers that what stood out to me the most about these books was the epic scope. It reminded me of <i>Dune</i> in the best way - the story touches on many of the bits of a big, wide world, and hints at even more that you get only the barest glimpses of. There's a rich culture that is very unlike ours, but filled with the same kind of men and women with the same kinds of hopes, dreams, and flaws we have always known. Further, in the BNS, not only does that scope extend across the world and beyond, but also through time. It starts, as many tales do, with a a promising young man thrust out of the familiar by circumstance, and he meets many challenges with varying degrees of success, learns about himself and the world, and as he comes to know and shape more and more of the world around him, we the readers come to learn of it. Along the way, he meets many characters, some endearing, some hateful, but all very human, even if only encountered for a moment. Wolfe has a knack for clearly describing what is happening in terms of the action, while slowly revealing how much more was going on around the action - the thoughts of the characters, the stakes, the ramifications, and so forth. He lulls you into thinking you're just reading a dry account of some things that happened, and only when he hits you with the reveal do you realize what was going on for the past several pages (or chapters, or books). It's a remarkable technique. At once it makes the book extremely readable, while also giving it great depth that's easy to miss if you treat it as casually as it seems to invite you to. Another structural trick Wolfe pulls is that the later you get into each book, the more that happens in shorter and shorter chapters. So, fair warning: if you're reading these before bed, as I was, when you get to what you think will be the last two or three days worth of reading, you might find yourself staying up far later than planned.
</p>

<p>
I know this has been some weird stuff to highlight in a "review," but truly, getting much more into specifics will start spoiling things pretty quick. So, if you enjoy thoughtful, deep speculative fiction with a wide world rendered in all of its bizarre opulence, that is nevertheless briskly plotted and full of plenty of action, you'll like these books - give them a read. If you've already read them, or if for some reason you don't care about spoilers or this doesn't sound like your cup of tea and you won't ever read them, then I have more substantive thoughts on what's in the books below.

<h3 id="org0a42eb0">SPOILERS AHEAD - What Makes The Book of the New Sun So Interesting?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a42eb0">
<p>
Alright, so, I went into reading BNS with <i>very</i> little notion of what I was getting into, with one exception (discussed below). All I really knew was that Wolfe was supposed to be very good, and this was maybe his greatest work. So why not start there? As it begins, you quickly settle into "okay, this is a fantasy world," with its castles and sword fights and a guild of torturers. But fairly early on, little bits of detail thrown out as just part of the description start catching you - did he just call the floor of the tower a "deck?" Do those soldiers have guns? Wait, and energy shields? In other words, you start to work out that this seemingly faux-medieval society has some very advanced technology, just in very limited hands. Further, you also start to gather clues that this isn't just some technological world fallen into a new middle ages, it is <i>our</i> world, and somewhere in South America to judge by the geographical clues you get as the story goes on. This kind of "slow reveal" plays out in multiple ways throughout the books - the details of the world and its technology, the nature of its relationship to other worlds in the universe, the nature of the narrator Severian, and even its moral/philosophical theme. Here is where I was "spoiled" a bit by David McGrogan over at <a href="https://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/">Monsters and Manuals</a>, a D&amp;D blog I've been reading for years. He made a comment in some post (can't find it just now) about the "slowly revealed Christianity" of BNS, and having now read it, I think he's right. Sure, it's a very weird scifi version of Christianity, but much of the moral development and growth of the story is along these lines. Luckily, like Lewis at his best, this doesn't degrade into cheap moralizing or "message fiction," but instead is played out in the thoughts, actions, and reflections of the characters entirely organically. As such, the overall story has a lot of growth, weight, and moral depth. Maybe the biggest, weirdest slow reveal, for which you need to read <i>The Urth of the New Sun</i> for full effect, is the mind-bending approach to time, space, and the universe(s). Characters live backward in time, others find their own graves, and more. All of it, Wolfe is keen to point out, is consistent with current (as of the 80s) scientific theories of how the universe might work, but told to evoke a sense of magic and wonder.
</p>

<p>
Further, Wolfe weaves in a <i>lot</i> of religious, occult, and esoteric references and themes. Many of the characters are named after saints, symbolism from the Tarot shows up, and the mind-bending time and universe stuff is framed in Cabalistic terms. Here's where the <i>Lexicon Urthus</i> I mentioned comes in handy - I waited until I finished to take a look at it, and so I've only glanced at a few entries. I also reckon that re-reading with more of these associations in mind would enrich the story where they show up (much like how <i>The Wasteland</i> is at least as much about its allusions as everything else it's doing). All that being said - the story works all by itself, so it's not like it's boring or confusing without this knowledge. There's also a recurring element in the form of a book of stories, some of which are given in full, others of which are summarized or mentioned by characters. The stories combine elements from familiar references, like <i>The Jungle Book</i>, but as filtered through thousands of years of re-telling and mutation. Again, Wolfe does a really good job of making what he presents interesting and relevant to the story, while any references or allusions are more Easter eggs than keys needed to unlock what's happening.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, BNS hits a lot of notes that much scifi, hell, much fiction of any sort, fails to pull off: a story that moves briskly and builds to a satisfying conclusion, deep characters that grow over time, numerous deep allusions, and a well-developed moral point of view that doesn't hammer you over the head. I can see what all the fuss is about, and if you got this far despite not reading it, I strongly recommend you check it out.

<i>I'm still plugging away at</i> The Seed of Yggdrasill, <i>but 1. chapter 2 is really long, and 2. I spent the weekend out of town with some friends. So, this post is a bit short, but I'm counting it as substantive enough not to be a "placeholder" for purposes of this year's oath. These are a handful of prayers that I say almost everyday. I find it helpful to bring the Gods into more bits of my day-to-day life than only my "main" prayer or daily spiritual practice. I hope you find it helpful, or at least interesting</i>.

<h3 id="orgf512eca">On Waking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf512eca">
<p>
I got this short stave from Eirik Westcoat's <i>Eagle's Mead</i>, and I try to remember to say it as soon as I wake up and get out of bed. It's a half stanza of <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">Ljodhahatt</a> followed by a half stanza of Galdralag. I also say my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#last_hail_idun">Hail Idun</a> after this.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This dawning day<br />
Brings deeds of might<br />
For us the brave and the bold.
</p>

<p>
Awake today,<br />
aware I'll live<br />
and find a rune to rown,<br />
and find a rune to write.<br />
Alu.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
("Rown" is an archaic word for "to whisper," with connotations of knowing and sharing a secret. "Alu" is the word that became "ale," but it seems to originally have meant the sacred quality inherent in alcoholic drinks, and only later came to mean the drink itself. I use it as pretty-much equivalent to "amen" when I pray.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgba8a190" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgba8a190">For Putting on Thunor's Hammer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgba8a190">
<p>
This is a quick little prayer that I say every time I put on my Thunor's Hammer necklace. My own practice is that I hold it in my left hand as I say the prayer, facing north, and as I say the words "Mighty Hallowing Hammer," I make the sign of the hammer over the hammer charm. I carved the charm itself from oak, put it on a leather thong, and put some beads on that to stand for the Gods, Goddesss, and Wights (spirits) that I have a relationship with. For a long time, I didn't wear a hammer, as I didn't have a particularly strong relationship with Thunor, but after some prayer and meditation, I realized one of the ways I could build that relationship was to wear the hammer and say a prayer every time I put it on, so here it is.
</p>

<p>
As for the poem itself, it's two half stanzas, one <i>slightly</i> defective, of Ljodhahatt (the last line has 4 stressed syllables, with two pairs of alliteration, rather than 2 out of 3 stressed syllables alliterating as would be strictly correct. I felt the meaning was more important than sticking strictly to the shape.):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
O Thund'rous Thunor<br />
Thanks I give<br />
For mighty hallowing hammer.<br />
</p>

<p>
Worthy may I wear<br />
This warding mark<br />
To banish bale and welcome weal.<br />
Alu.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
("Bale" is an archaic word for "harm, injury, evil" and "weal" is an archaic word for "well-being," which is the root of "wealth.")

<h3 id="org6d2288e">Before Bethinking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d2288e">
<p>
I say this one after a few minutes of "Color Breathing" (doing the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/67579.html">Four-Fold Breath</a> while visualizing a color entering my body through my solar plexus on the inhale, filling me while I hold air in my lungs, then leaving through my solar plexus as I breathe out, and filling the air around me while I hold the air outside. I do a different color for each day of the week, given in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-dolmen-arch-a-study-course-in-the-druid-mysteries-volume-1-the-lesser-mysteries-john-m-greer/18188126?ean=9781935006916">The Dolmen Arch, Volume 1</a>, but Yellow is a good general-purpose color) and before settling into the theme of my bethinking (discursive meditation). This one is two half stanzas of Galdralag. The "kindly" in the second half stanza is unstressed, which is <i>kinda</i> cheating, but it felt more important to be respectful than strictly meet the meter.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Oh spellweavers,<br />
Wounded by spears,<br />
Lost lives for wisdom,<br />
Wakened well for lore!
</p>

<p>
Hail Woden!<br />
Hail Frige too!<br />
Kindly weaken bonds on my wits<br />
And unfetter my heart to hear!<br />
Alu
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(This prayer calls upon Woden and Frige (my take on the Old English name for Old Norse <i>Freyja</i>. This is slightly controversial, as we don't have clear attestation of whether the Anglo-Saxons worshipped equivalents of <i>Freyja</i> and <i>Frigg</i> as separate Goddesses, and if so, what Their names would have been. My own gnosis has me worship Them as Frigg and Frige (pronounced "Free-yuh")). It references two mythic events: Woden stabbing himself with his spear and then hanging himself upon Yggdrasill and <i>Gullveig</i> the first witch being killed by spears and burned by the <i>Aesir</i>. I accept the interpretation that <i>Gullveig</i> is <i>Freyja</i>, and that both of these deaths-and-rebirths are magical initiations, and so I invoke them in my own seeking initiation.)

<h3 id="org5f6b4eb">Before Eating</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5f6b4eb">
<p>
This one does not follow a poetic shape, but I based it on a poem found in <i>Northern Practice for the Solitary Practitioner</i> by Galina Krasskova and Raven Kaldera. Blessing your food is a good idea for all kinds of reasons, and I also like to use the chance to remind myself how much work goes into putting food on my plate, and my thankfulness for all of the beings that helped that happen.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I thank the Wen of land and sea for this food.<br />
I put forth my blessings to the souls of the beings that went into it,<br />
The lands it came from,<br />
The wights of those lands,<br />
Those who got it from there to here,<br />
Those who made it,<br />
And those who share it.<br />
May all of their might and main feed our hearts, as well as our bodies.<br />
Alu.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
("Wen" is one way to wend (translate) Old Norse <i>Vanir</i> into English. It's not actually attested in Old English, but using what we know of how Old Norse and English both changed from Proto-Germanic, the singular would be "Wan," and this reconstruction assumes it would have fit into the same class of nouns as "Man/Men." I've also seen reconstructions that assume a standard plural and instead go for "Wan/Wanes." I don't have the linguistic chops to know which is a more plausible reconstruction, Wen "feels right" to me.)

<p>
I say this one whenever I bless a drink for prayer or the oil for the lamp I light on my stall (altar). It doesn't <i>quite</i> fit any of the meters, as I haven't been able to come up with something I'm happy with yet. As such, I might change this if I can work something out.

<p>
This one is also from Eirik Westcoat's <i>Eagle's Mead</i>, and follows the same mixed Ljodhahatt/Galdralag shape as the waking stave. Again, I say my <i>Hail Idun</i> as well.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Now I wend my way<br />
Into the well of sleep<br />
To thee oh wynnful Woden.

<p>

I'll listen well,<br />

<p>
("Wynnful" is an archaic word for "delight, pleasure" with connotations of folks getting along and being happy in each other's company. "Wode" is the spirit/substance of inspiration/poetry/ecstasy that forms the root of "Woden." In Old Norse it is <i>Oðr</i>.)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-books_military_fiction">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-August-06
</p>

<p>
Well, thanks both to the second chapter of <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#book_the_seed_of_yggdrasill_1_introduction_and_the_books_of_old">The Seed of Yggdrasill</a> being very
long and to my daughters being a bit of a handful this weekend, I'm going to
take the recommendation of <a href="http://www.sothismedias.com/">Justin Patrick Moore</a> and work over a comment I made
over on <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/notes-on-stormtrooper-syndrome/">a recent Ecosophia post</a> as this week's post. JPM asked for some
"Military Fiction" to consider reading, and I went over to my bookshelves (both
physical and virtual) and marked any books that seemed like they fit that ask.
Below, I've taken those and cleaned them up a bit, so if you're looking for some
fiction to read that scratches a military itch, here goes.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdaa9325" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdaa9325">The Carrera Series - Tom Kratman</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdaa9325">
<p>
When I heard "military fiction," these were some of the first books that came to
mind. Kratman is a former Army officer who finished his career as a JAG working
on rules of engagement, but before that was an enlisted guy and a combat arms
officer who served in the invasion of Panama. The conceit of the series is that
there's another planet that is <i>very much</i> like Earth, has been settled by
mankind, but for some reason I can't remember, it's technology level is
basically that of the early 21st century. I say "conceit," because this is
<i>clearly</i> an excuse to set up conflicts between analogues of real-world nations,
but with the narrative flexibility to change things that might be inconvenient
in a straight "alternate history" piece of writing. These books are <i>very</i> focused
on the technology, tactics, and strategy of war, but also with more
philosophical musing on the subject than you might expect. Kratman also writes
from an unabashedly right wing place, and some of what's in the books is
definitely meant to troll left wing folks - the "Not EU" of this world is a
frequent punching bag. Stay away if you don't want lots of blood-and-guts action
scenes or if the political thing bugs you.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org031b9e2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org031b9e2">Gates of Fire - Steven Pressfield</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org031b9e2">
<p>
This book is a fictional telling of the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae">Battle of Thermopylae</a>, where
a Greek coalition led by the Spartan King Leonidas and his 300 Spartiates fought
the oncoming Persian army. It's <i>way</i> more historically accurate than Frank
Miller's <i>300</i>, but it still takes some liberties, as it is mostly a vehicle for
showcasing the kinds of virtues that make men fight against impossible odds. As
such, the Spartiates come across as very admirable, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/category/collections/this-isnt-sparta/">might not be that
accurate</a>. That being said, it's very popular in the military today, especially
among elite units, as a model for what camaraderie and discipline can look like.
Pressfield was a Marine, and he gets the grunts-eye-view of small unit dynamics
very clearly.

<h3 id="orgfc53ad0">Galaxy's Edge Series - Jason Anspach &amp; Nick Cole</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfc53ad0">
<p>
I haven't actually read any of this yet, but I've heard good things. One online
friend said it's like "Star Wars, but written by hardass vets." I've been a bit
turned off of space-oriented scifi for a bit now, but I'll likely check this out
at some point.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2411e46" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2411e46">Cryptonomicon, Baroque Cycle, and Reamde - Neal Stephenson</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2411e46">
<p>
Okay, these aren't <i>exactly</i> "military fiction," as there's a lot of other stuff
going on, but <i>Cryptonomicon</i> and the <i>Baroque Cycle</i> have significant portions that
follow soldiers around on wacky missions and through huge battles. <i>Reamde</i> is a
techno-thriller, but one of its main characters is an ex-Spetsnaz guy, and there
are a lot of gunfights. Stephenson doesn't have any military experience, but
from his writing, it's clear that he knows vets and has listened to them, as his
depictions of military guys land right.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdf14f83" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdf14f83">Chronicles of the Black Company - Glen Cook</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf14f83">
<p>
These are well-known "dark fantasy" short stories that follow an amoral
mercenary company that is fighting in a stereotypical fantasy war, complete with
an evil sorceress queen. The thing is, they're fighting <i>for</i> her, not against.
Cook was in the Navy during Vietnam, and was apparently attached to a Marine
Force Recon unit, but he never deployed. For me, this walks the fine line of
"interestingly edgy" and "annoyingly cynical" rather well (unlike, say <i>The Blade
Itself</i> which was everything I was afraid a "dark fantasy" book would be, and
worse). I've only read the first collection of these stories, so I don't know if
they keep up the quality as they go.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc83777a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc83777a">The Aubrey-Maturin Series - Patrick O'Brian</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc83777a">
<p>
These are best known for the movie adaptation <i>Master and Commander</i>, starring
Russell Crowe. These books go <i>deep</i> on what it was like living and fighting on a
ship in the British Navy in the Napoleonic wars, kind of like Moby Dick, but
with warships. Even if that's not your thing, the action scenes are engaging,
you get occasional forays into Jane Austen-style high society, and the
relationship between the two main characters is dynamic and interesting. If
you'd like to go deeper on the real life impacts of naval war, A.T. Mahan's
classic of military history <i>The Influence of Sea Power Upon History</i> makes for a
fascinating and well-written complement.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf133c23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf133c23">Arabella of Mars - David D. Levine</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf133c23">
<p>
Speaking of Napoleonic naval matters, <i>Arabella of Mars</i> gives a taste of that,
but IIIINNNNN SPPPPAAAACCCEEE. This book uses the archaic idea that the sky just
kept going, and that all of the planets just spin around in it. So, you can
float a ship up high enough, and then sail the solar winds to Mars or Venus or
the like, which are of course populated by the kind of denizens 19th century
authors put there. The first book is a fun swashbuckle with a dash of romance
consciously written in the style of 19th century adventure stories by the likes
of Haggard or Burroughs. Apparently, though, this upset some folks for
glorifying colonialism or something of the sort, and to try to make up for this,
Levine wrote the next two books with much more of a political chip on his
shoulder, which rather squashed the light-hearted adventure, so I can't really
recommend them, but the first one is fun and a complete-enough story to satisfy.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2378142" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2378142">Starship Troopers - Robert Heinlein</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2378142">
<p>
Maybe the most famous work of military scifi ever written, this is a classic for
a reason. If your only exposure to the name is the Paul Verhoeven movie, set all
that aside. It turns out the screenplay for the movie wasn't initially based on
the book at all - it was retrofitted after they got the rights. Now, I love the
movie in all of its cheesy glory, but the book is way, way better in every way.
Mostly a coming-of-age story about a young man who finds meaning and purpose in
the military, it's also got some political philosophy and cool technology.
Significant contributor to why I enlisted rather than taking a commission when I
joined the Army (hell, likely a significant contributor to my joining the Army
at all, if we're being honest here).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org71f0f98" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org71f0f98">Old Man's War - John Scalzi</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71f0f98">
<p>
This book is a clear homage to <i>Starship Troopers</i>. It's not really amazing or
anything, but it's pretty fun. Once again, the first book in this series hews
close to the form it's an homage to, to its benefit, and the later books in the
series go in some different directions that I found less interesting. Also, as
far as I know, Scalzi has no military experience, and he doesn't <i>quite</i> get the
"military mindset" as well as many of these other authors, but this book is not
as hurt by that as it could be, as the main character is a new recruit finding
his way in an unfamiliar world. One thing that makes me appreciate this book
more than it deserves is that while it leans into "humans are kinda weak and
squishy compared to the aliens we've run into," it doesn't treat humans as
helpless babes in the woods - instead, thanks to being mean as piss and ready to
take anything that works from other species, humans are definitely contenders.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge3cc6d7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge3cc6d7">The Man-Kzin Wars - Larry Niven and Others</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge3cc6d7">
<p>
Speaking of mankind being dangerous to aliens, <i>The Man-Kzin Wars</i> was a project
created by Larry Niven to bring many scifi writers together around a loose theme
(the eponymous wars), I've only read the first collection, which features Poul
Anderson. These wars are a prequel to Niven's <i>Ringworld</i>, which has some really
interesting alien psychology, but is not so much military. If you don't know the
world, the Kzin are a cat-like species that is very aggressive and warlike, and
is one of the first (maybe the very first?) species of aliens mankind runs into.
As with <i>Old Man's War</i>, one of my favorite bits is how seriously it takes the
thought that mankind is dangerous. In this future, we had finally learned how to
get along with each other, then we met these warlike cats who want to fight, and
we’re like “guys, do you have any idea what our <i>whole deal</i> is? You sure you want
to go down this road?” The stories themselves are of somewhat variable quality,
and not all are really “military scifi,” but there were a few that I liked quite
a bit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org156efe8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org156efe8">The Mongoliad Cycle - Greg Bear, Neal Stephenson, Mark Teppo, and Others</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org156efe8">
<p>
Another one that isn't exactly military, but certainly is <i>martial</i>, is <i>The
Mongoliad</i>, which was a joint writing effort by a few authors, including Neal
Stephenson, that was an attempt to launch a multimedia franchise around western
martial arts, using a fictional warrior monastery as its focal point (think
Shaolin monks, but in plate with longswords). I enjoyed the initial cycle of
books, but the short stories and spinoffs did less and less for me, so I ended
up putting them down. Strongly recommended if you have an interest in historical
European martial arts (the authors all know each other from their HEMA group,
and so the fight scenes are loaded with realistic details).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgffee0d6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgffee0d6">The Furies of Calderon Series - Jim Butcher</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgffee0d6">
<p>
The <i>Furies of Calderon</i> series has some strong military elements as it goes on,
though again, I might not call it "military fantasy". Apparently, someone
challenged Butcher to write a series based on a prompt something like "Pokemon
meets the four elements." He took up the challenge and managed to make that <i>not</i>
cheesy, as the "Pokemon" are elemental nature spirits, and are how folks do
magic in this world. Speaking of folks, they're basically Romans facing
barbarian invaders, hence the military element that comes up more and more. I
don't think they're quite as good as <i>The Dresden Files</i>, but it's got likable
characters with good growth, it's very readable and well-paced, and explores the
implications of the world-building.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0cb5dec" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0cb5dec">Musashi - Eiji Yoshikawa</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0cb5dec">
<p>
Lastly, another “martial”, but not “military” book – <i>Musashi</i> by Eiji Yoshikawa
is a big sprawling epic about the most famous swordsman of Japanese history, and
it does a good job of exploring a warrior mindset, even if most of the book is
not about battles. Also, when the battles do happen, they tend to be smaller
fights, rather than clashes of armies. Even still, it's got a lot of tension and
action and it does a really good job of exploring the conflict between the
martial virtues and the softer virtues of everyday life.

<h3 id="org5b35a28">Lead-In: My Mixed Feelings Coming into this Book</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5b35a28">
<p>
Earlier this year, as research for my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#last_hail_idun">Hail Idun</a>, I read <i>The Goddess Idhunn in
Poetry and Myth</i> by Maria Kvilhaug (for which I could have <i>sworn</i> I had a
write-up, but I must have made that up). I heard about Kvilhaug when folks
pointed me to her Master's thesis <i>Maiden and the Mead Cup</i> and her main book, <i>The
Seed of Yggdrasill</i>, and what I found when I dipped my toes in both of those
intrigued me greatly, but this was during my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year with the dead</a>, and so I had to
hold off. Then, in the same year (2022), she put out <i>The Goddess Idhunn</i>, and I
knew I had to read that as soon as I could. It was the first non-fiction book I
read of the year, and I was almost hopping up and down for a book-length
treatment of a Goddess that is very important to me.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, the book gave me <i>exactly</i> what I was looking for: wonderful,
in-depth analysis of every stanza of the two Eddic poems that feature Idhunn.
Translations of every proper name in those poems, so that the potential symbolic
meanings of characters, places, and things can be understood. A thorough
run-down of possible archaeological evidence for related (or the same?)
Goddesses. A full list of every kenning given for Idhunn, <i>with translations of
included proper names</i>. A discussion of what Her own name might mean, and
alternative possible etymologies. It was very nearly the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4pZFsEdP3Y">perfect country and
western song</a>, err, I mean, perfect book on one of the non-star Norse
Goddesses.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, whooooo boy, some things about that book were
<i>infuriating</i>. There's no index. There's no footnotes. There are annoying typos
and formatting errors that occasionally introduce confusion about meaning (like
not ending <i>italics</i> after a quote is finished, or leaving out the verb). Worst of
all, <i>it's a collection of transcripts of video lectures originally put out on
YouTube</i>. And it appears to be barely edited at all. This means that missteps in
speech are part of the text, as is an amount of repetition that can be useful
from one video to the next, but not so much within a lone 200 leaf book. It also
uses the kind of fluid "mostly organized" approach that can sound conversational
and thus fine in a spoken context, but a tighter organization would be much,
much better.
</p>

<p>
All of which means that I found <i>The Goddess Idhunn</i> terribly frustrating: it has
some truly worthwhile stuff in it, helpful to any student of Norse myth, and
invaluable to someone for whom Idhunn plays an important role in religion, but
it could be shared in ways that were so much easier to understand, reference,
and so forth. So why am I telling you so much about this little book in a post
about a whole 'nother book? Because it's 600-leaf big sister of a book, <i>The Seed
of Yggdrasill</i> shows many of the same strengths and weaknesses, and that's much
of what's kept me from getting to it for the last few months. That being said, I
have now more than once had the distinctly hair-pulling experience of pulling
<i>The Seed of Yggdrasill</i> out to get Kvilhaug's take on something, or her
translation of a name, finding hints at something that feels deeply meaningful
and worthwhile to add to my understanding of the Lore, but not being able to
find the specific thing I was looking for, or else only finding it after 3 or 4
tangents. I realized I was going to have to tackle the whole thing, get a good
idea of what's in there, and organize my own damn notes as a reference, since
this book isn't going to do it for me. That being said, the book is a <i>bear</i> - not
only 600 pages, but 600 textbook-sized pages, and though there are a fair number
of pictures and single column poetry translations, it's still pretty much as
long you'd think, so it's gonna take some doing to get through this, and I'm
going to post on it as I go. Let's get to it!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7c52a7c">
<p>
First, a handful of thoughts on the physical book. I have the 2020 edition,
which is the one currently available, but it was first printed in 2012 as a
hardcover. These days, you can only get paperback, which seems to be POD via
Amazon. Kvilhaug's "publisher" is <a href="https://the3littlesisters.com/">Three Little Sisters</a>, which has links to all
of her books, but as I said, these days, I think they're just ebooks or POD
through Amazon. To be fair, it does seem to be at the higher end of resolution
and print quality, as far as POD goes, at least the full-color version I have.
As I said above, some of the formatting leaves some things to be desired - the
title page is on the left page of the very first spread in the book, with the
copyright page on the right side, and the title on the spine is backwards from
what I would expect (is this a European/Scandinavian thing? I think I saw it on
another book put out by someone from there). The typography is unobtrusively
attractive, set in Georgia, and with distinct-enough headers and such to stand
out. As I mentioned, there's a decent number of pictures, but not a ton, and
they're usually pretty small. Most of these are black and white and/or
line-work, such as the sketches archaeologists make of carvings or reconstructed
artifacts, but some of the pictures benefit from the color. It might also be
that the pretty crisp resolution of the printing only comes with the color
version. Altogether, this is neither slapdash nor anything to write home about,
but a perfectly serviceable medium for delivering the information it has. I just
wish there were still a hardcover version available with better binding, for the
sake of longevity.

<h3 id="org026a967">Upfront Stuff</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org026a967">
<p>
This bit is very short, but has a few handy things in it. Kvilhaug begins by
telling the tale of how she came to care about Norse Myth, after being taught as
a kid in Norwegian school that these were basically "the silly stories folks
believed before they got Christianity, and then even better, science" (which
just hurts my heart to hear). She then talks about how the translations of the
poems are her own, some spelling conventions, and some basics on how letters in
Old Norse words are pronounced. Lastly for these quick 8 pages, the best bits: a
list of Old Norse magical/religious terms, a list of Old Norse terms for
religious professions of different kinds, and a list of the kinds of divine
beings talked about in Norse myth, broken up into the masculine and feminine
powers. This last one especially is helpful for giving not only a translation of
the name for the group, but also a few thoughts on how/when different terms were
used. Altogether, most of this stuff is likely not <i>needed</i> for anyone who's going
to read this particular book (this is emphatically <i>not</i> "My First Book on Norse
Myth"), much of it helpful nonetheless.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org718a38c">
<p>
Okay, I gotta admit, looking through the table of contents, I assumed this
chapter would be a mostly-skippable overview of the content and history of our
sources for Norse myth that I mostly already know. There is some of that, but I
was pleasantly surprised to find there's actually more here as well - in 56
pages, I filled up three 4x6 notecards (one side only) with notes. Don't worry,
I'm not going to try to squeeze all of that into this post, but there was a lot
that seemed interesting, insightful, or a useful thread to follow up on.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org044d42b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org044d42b">The Eddic Poem Rundowns are Great</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org044d42b">
<p>
First, Kvilhaug lists each of the Eddic poems with a brief summary. She includes
two poems that are not always included in published version of <i>The Poetic Edda</i>,
<i>Odhins Hrafnagaldur</i> (Odin's Ravenspell) and <i>Solarliodh</i> (The Song of the Sun).
The reason these poems are not always included is that their date of composition
is controversial, and many scholars believe them to be later compositions by
antiquarians. Kvilhaug argues that they show enough understanding of the
fundamentally heathen <i>structure</i> of the other poems that even if they are not as
old, they were nonetheless written by someone with heathen sensibilities. In my
own work, I've found <i>Odhins Hrafnagaldur</i> very worthwhile as a source for imagery
and threads for bethinking (meditation). I haven't checked out <i>Solarliodh</i> yet,
though. At any rate, the real gold in this bit is the summaries. Kvilhaug does a
great job of briefly relating what happens in the poems, plot-wise, but also
what the poem is doing spiritually/religiously, according to her method of
interpretation (more on that below). These really are great. You might not
wholly buy her take on these poems, but if you plan on bethinking on them, her
take is worth adding to your list of ways to consider what they mean. I am so
glad I didn't skip this bit.
</p>

<p>
One example of what these add: the later poems in the <i>Poetic Edda</i> are often called the "heroic poems," as they deal less with the Gods and how the world came to be or where it is going, but instead with the adventures of human heroes (though these often cross paths with the Gods, of course). Kvilhaug's interpretation is that these are initiatory tales, and that the sequence of tales shows a soul getting part of the way there, dying, reincarnating, and then getting further along each time, turning what can feel like a loosely-linked anthology into a coherent spiritually relevant cycle. I'm not sure that she's right, but wow! What a different and more interesting way to look at these than only "some cool adventure stories with some perplexing elements."

<div id="outline-container-org942f1f6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org942f1f6">What was Snorri Up to with the Prose Edda?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org942f1f6">
<p>
Okay, real quick, in case you don't know, what's up with this "Edda" business, one "Prose" and one "Poetic"? Snorri Sturlusson was an Icelandic statesman/poet/badass of the 13th century. He wrote a book that he called <i>Edda</i>, and by sometime between the late medieval and early modern era, nobody remembered what the hell that was supposed to mean, but since it was a book about how to compose poetry, they figured it was something like "book of poetry/poetics." He also keeps talking about all of these famous old heathen poems, but nobody had ever seen them, so there was speculation that there must have been an "Elder Edda" that he was quoting. Lo and behold, in 1643, Bishop Brynjolfur Sveinsson is handed this old manuscript a family has handed down for who knows how long, and it's got all (most) of those famous old poems! Here was the hypothesized "Elder Edda!" Over the years, one way of distinguishing these besides the "Elder" and "Younger" (which you'll still find occasionally, especially in older writing), was to call one "Prose" and the other "Poetic," since Snorri's work was a work of prose full of quotes of poetry, whereas the mysterious manuscript (known today as the <i>Codex Regius</i>) was almost entirely poems, except for a few prose introductions. Well, later scholarship has found no sign that anything was ever called "Edda" before Snorri's work, and the <i>Codex Regius</i> doesn't have any title on it, and later finds of other manuscripts have found other versions of the same poems, along with a few that were not in the <i>Codex Regius</i> but seem to be from the same time and/or in the same title. All of these poems sometimes get collected by scholars and translators and published, and the name everyone has agreed upon for this body of work is "The Poetic Edda," despite it's goofy history. As I mentioned, which manuscripts to favor when there are differences between them, even which poems to include or leave out, are matters of some debate, and different scholars come to different conclusions. The most important poems will be in any version of the <i>Poetic Edda</i> you get, and Kvilhaug takes a maximalist approach, so she summarizes everything that has ever been considered a part of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. If you really want to get more into it, there's lots of books and articles on the subject to dive into.
</p>

<p>
Whew, okay. So back to Snorri. Snorri loved the poetry of his folk, and he saw that fewer and fewer Icelanders were learning how to do it, and he set out to write a guide that would help folks learn the craft. Doing this was more complex than just explaining the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">rules of alliteration</a>, meter, and so forth, though. You see, right at the heart of Old Norse poetry is something called the <i>kenning</i>, which means "that by which someone or something is known," and is basically a metaphor. A famous kenning from <i>Beowulf</i> is the "whale way/road" as a name for the sea. Another common one is "flame of battle" to mean "sword." So far, so good, but <i>very many</i> traditional kennings were based on mythological stories. If you think about it long enough, you might work out what a "flame of battle" is from context and imagination, but unless you know the story, it's <i>much</i> harder to work out that "Otter's Ransom" means "gold." In other words, the Old Norse heathen tales were baked right in to the very way they made poetry. And it gets even harder: kennings can go <i>fractal</i>. Instead of just "flame of battle," I might decide to substitute in a kenning for one or more of the ideas in there - like "Gullveig's Welcome of Odhin's Delight." As we'll get more into later, Old Norse poets and audiences ate this stuff up - they saw poems as puzzles, and decoding the nested metaphors and allusions was at least half the fun. All of which was well and good when everyone grew up hearing these tales from their grandmas and having them reinforced by seasonal rites, but was way harder for Christians who had never heard these tales, or only knew bits and scraps about "the old superstitions."
</p>

<p>
So, in his <i>Edda</i>, Snorri set out not only to lay out the rules of meter, nor only to explain the plain meaning of mythological kennings, but also to explain enough about the mythology that new composers could write poetry with their own mythologically-grounded kennings. To make this happen, he did his best to bring together what was then still known about the old tales, try to resolve a few things that seemed like contradictions to him, and put it all in an easy-to-understand package. There was a catch, though. By Snorri's life, Iceland was a firmly Christian country and the Christian church has not always been keen on the spread of stories about other Gods. So Snorri had to thread a very careful path: tell as much of the tales as he could, but in a way that didn't get him branded a secret heathen. He rather cleverly managed this through a combination of euhemerization and frame stories. If you don't spend a lot of time reading about old religions, you might not have met the word "euhemerization." It comes from a Greek scholar named Euhemerus who tried to find logical explanations for myths. These days, the term is mostly used to refer to the process of recasting/interpreting mythical figures like Gods as merely remarkable humans. Thus, Odhinn was not the king of the Gods, but a long-ago king with mighty magic who became so feared and respected that folks started worshiping him as a God. Sometimes this process goes very far, as with most Irish and Welsh "myth" that we have left, which is usually presented as history, but which various clues indicate were derived from myths about the Gods. Anyway, so Snorri claimed that the Gods were warriors and magicians of long ago who made a big impression, but that's not the only thing he did. He also included the <i>Gylfaginning</i>, usually rendered as something like "The Deluding of Gylfi," but Kvilhaug prefers "The Revelation/Vision of Gylfi." In this story, Gylfi, himself a king and wizard, disguises himself and seeks out the wizard king Odhinn to find out what all the fuss is about. He is taken before three Beings, "High," "Just as High," and "The Third," all of whom are presented as disguises for Odhinn. There, Gylfi asks questions about how the world was made, who rules it, and so forth, and the Three answer him with material from Norse myth and cosmology.
</p>

<p>
This was really rather clever. The framing allows Snorri to say "I didn't say this stuff was true, I said some crazy wizard told some lies to another crazy wizard and folks believed it before we got Jesus." He can present all of the details of the heathen cosmology and Gods because they are cast as <i>beguiling lies</i>. I haven't ever encountered anyone else who managed to so artfully preserve non-Christian teachings in a hostile Christian context, so well-done, Snorri!
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, let's take a moment to appreciate how strangely lucky we are to have so much preserved. Thanks to <i>one family</i> on a windswept island in the North Atlantic, we have most of the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. Thanks to <i>one guy</i> on that same island, and his sharp thinking, we have a textbook describing what was going on in what might otherwise have been entirely opaque poems. If you haven't ever read much about ancient knowledge, you might not realize how great this is. You know the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>? While those two were always regarded as the best, there was a whole <i>cycle</i> of other epics that covered the entire Trojan War, and they're all lost. Lost from one of the most literate and continuously-inhabited bits of Europe/Asia/Africa since folks have been writing anything down. We don't even have everything by Plato or Aristotle! It's darn near <i>miraculous</i> - given my own beliefs, I'm inclined to think that the Hooded One had a hand in keeping His stories alive and ready for an age once again ready for them.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, there are two remarkable exceptions to what Snorri included under the guise of "wrong things our ancestors believed" - despite quoting the <i>Voluspa</i> and <i>Havamal</i> extensively, showing he knew those poems, he never once mentions the attempted killing of Gullveig the sorceress in <i>Voluspa</i> or Odhin's giving of himself to himself upon the Tree to gain the Runes in <i>Havamal</i>. Kvilhaug finds these conspicuous absences <i>too</i> conspicuous, and thinks that Snorri left them out because they were so obviously models of heathen magical initiation. I'm not sure, but it does seem odd when he was so careful about everything else.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-kvilhaugs_methods_of_interpretation" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="kvilhaugs_methods_of_interpretation">Kvilhaug's Method of Interpretation Leans Heavily on Kennings, Name Meanings, and Structural Elements</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-kvilhaugs_methods_of_interpretation">
<p>
Kvilhaug helpfully lays out her approach to interpreting Old Norse myths and poems, which she breaks into four main bits, and three supplementary ones. The first of her main tools is to look at the kennings being used. Of course, you need to figure out "who or what is this kenning referring to?" to have any idea what's going on in the poem, but there's an additional layer here - <i>which</i> kenning gets used tells you what kind of associations the poet was shooting for. If you refer to Odhinn as "Frenzy of Battle," you are calling to mind a very different side of Him than if you refer to Him as "Wandering Learner." If you bring in the fractal nature of kennings we mentioned above, you can get multi-layered references going on. The "giver of Baldr's funeral gift" as a way to call Odhinn would 1. emphasize Odhinn as Baldr's father, 2. bring up Baldr's death, 3. bring up <i>Draupnir</i>, Odhin's ring-making magic ring, forged by the dwarves, along with the whole tale of its making, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The second bit that Kvilhaug makes much use of, and here is where her work truly shines, is in looking at the meanings of the names given to folks, things, and steads in the myths. Most translators leave names untranslated or lightly localize them (such as turning "Odhinn" into "Odin"). Occasionally, if it's <i>really</i> obvious the name is important to the poem, like a pun revolves around it, or there's some irony around a character's name, or what have you, other translators will give the name's meaning in a footnote. But most translators treat names as merely arbitrary tokens that mean nothing other than the being, thing, or stead referred to. Maybe <i>the</i> key insight of Kvilhaug is that this leaves huge amounts of meaning on the table when it comes to understanding what these poems are doing. That was what actually led me to check out Kvilhaug in the first place - hearing that she translated <i>every</i> name. So far, I've got to say I'm with her on this. There is often a <i>ton</i> of meaning baked into only the names being used in a poem or myth.
</p>

<p>
Let's run through an example, with the story of how the <i>jotun</i> Thjazi kidnaps Idhunn and takes her back to his home in Thrymsheim, before Loki borrows Freyja's falcon-shape to steal Her back in the shape of a nut, barely escaping as Thjazi chases in the shape of an eagle, before Thjazi is caught in a fire set by the Gods in Asgard. Well, this thumbnail sketch of the myth comes across very differently than if we talk about how the devourer Slave-Binder kidnapped the Goddess of Water that Returns to Its Source and took her back to his home in the Land of Drumming, before Loki (even Kvilhaug can't figure his name out) borrows the Lady's falcon-shape to steal Her back in the shape of a nut, barely escaping as Slave-Binder chases in the shape of an eagle, before Slave-Binder is caught in a fire set by the Gods in the Divine Ancestor Enclosure. See how much is going on there, just from translating the names? As I said, this is what brought me to Kvilhaug's work, and so far, it hasn't disappointed in terms of opening up many new paths to explore.
</p>

<p>
Kvilhaug also emphasizes the structural element, which she calls "interpreting the myth as parable." I'm not exactly sure why the scholars she's inspired by use the word "parable," since it doesn't seem to have much in common with the kind of stories told by Jesus for moral edification, but rather looking at the narrative structure of the myth and identifying how it holds together the different elements. One of those elements that Kvilhaug has identified are repeating "formulae." These are things like "three Gods traveling together" or "two complementary Beings get married." So, if you wanted to take this approach to Odhinn winning the Mead of Poetry, you'd focus on how Odhinn changes shape, goes underground, meets a female figure, they have sex, he takes a precious liquid, and then changes shape to escape again, chased by a giant who has also changed shape. Now, clearly, the details of each of these steps likely have meaning (why does he change into a snake at first and an eagle at the end? <i>Which</i> female figure gives him <i>what</i> precious liquid?), but boiling it down like this also can help us find parallels with other stories, the formulae Kvilhaug talks about, and sometimes get a clearer picture of what is being said about the different elements interacting.
</p>

<p>
Now, to supplement these core elements (kennings, name meanings, and structure), Kvilhaug has a few other notes. First, she points out that she does <i>not</i> lean very heavily on comparative mythology in this book. If you're not familiar, comparative mythology is when you do something like looking at Celtic or Roman or Indian myths to find parallels with Norse myths and see if that can help you understand things better. Kvilhaug says she is a fan of comparative mythology, has learned a lot from it, but that she thinks it takes away from her core message of "look what you can find out just by paying attention to the kennings, name meanings, and structures."  The other thing she does is to point out how her understanding is that the myths can be understood, enjoyed, and found meaningful at multiple levels, whether as magical tales, clues to religious ritual, or representations of deeper spiritual realities. She compares this to how the myths can function for laity, priests, and esotericists. Kvilhaug describes herself as a "pantheist," which can mean different things to different folks, but for her means that every Being, including spirits, Gods, and so forth, are truly manifestations of one universal spiritual reality. As such, her preferred meaning for these myths is as symbolic explanations of how different forces/tendencies/characteristics interact with each other, both within the individual, and in the wider cosmos ("as above, so below").
</p>

<p>
I get the impression she is trying to be even-handed and broadminded here, allowing for different folks to get different things from the myths, but there's a distinct feeling that she finds the more symbolic/esoteric interpretations "better," like the other ways of understanding the myths are mere stepping stones to getting to the "real" meaning. I might be reading more in than she actually feels, but I got a strong whiff of snobbery for those poor, benighted souls who are so foolish as to think that the "Gods" have any of Their "own" meaning besides what They can help you know about the whole behind them. My own beliefs right now aren't so far off from Kvilhaug on this, but I put more weight on the distinctness and importance of the different manifestations of the holy. Sure, maybe in some sense Woden and Thunor and me and my cat are all "just" manifestations of one cosmic creative principle, but at least right here and right now, we're also different and separate in important ways, and I think that matters. So, that leads me to look at the very many ways myths can be understood and think that all of them have worth, and that all of them are true <i>at the same time</i>. Any given myth is an exciting magical tale, an reenactment of an initiatory ritual, a symbolic representation of the forces of consciousness, and much else besides. That's what makes true myth so rich. All that being said, it's a minor gripe.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org25b02b6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org25b02b6">Gender is One of the Building Blocks for Understanding Myth</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org25b02b6">
<p>
Kvilhaug makes a few points about how one of the groundmost ways of organizing/understanding the symbols in the myths is by their gender, and if we want to understand that, we need to understand what we can about the gender roles of folks in the lands that crafted these tales at the times they did so. All of which makes good sense to me. In laying out what Iron/Viking-Age northern European gender roles were like, Kvilhaug is mostly pretty even-handed, though at times she seems to have a bit of a rose-colored tint to how she thinks women were thought of, treated, and so forth. She also gets <i>weirdly</i> harsh about the effect of the Christian church. She makes the good point that most of us tend to think of views on gender as either "modern" or "old-fashioned," and what we think of as "old-fashioned" was heavily influenced by the church, so when we come across non-Christian societies, we run the risk of making a category error. Again, all true, but then she hauls off and blames everything bad about past beliefs about sex and gender on the church, which strikes me as, well, un-nuanced, at the very least. At any rate, despite all of that, what she boils down about what things that are masculine or feminine are doing in myths is basically the same stuff that Jung worked out, as popularized and somewhat simplified by <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#jordan_peterson_s_framework_for_myth">Jordan Peterson</a>, which is unsurprising, as the deepest mythological associations with sex and gender are likely due to physical realities that don't change all that much among different human groups.

<h4 id="org6c7b19f">A Few Stray Insights - Creation is a Story and the Red Gold of Initiation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6c7b19f">
<p>
I couldn't find another place to weave these in, but Kvilhaug makes a couple of points that I suspect she'll develop further in the book that I liked well enough to call out. The first is that she points out how the creation of the cosmos is always <i>narrated</i>, and in at least one place, is explicitly described as weaving a tale. As such, she raises the thought that all of that which is might be thought of as a story or a poem being told by Whatever or Whomever the creator might be. This is a lovely and interesting thought, and it might not be so far fetched, considering that Tolkien presented the act of creation as a great symphony, and he was <i>deeply</i> shaped by the Old Norse myths. The other insight I didn't have anywhere better to put is the thought that the "Red Gold" often mentioned in the myths is best thought of as the kind of wisdom gained through initiatory experience, which is itself the ultimate treasure. Obviously as someone pursuing initiatory paths to wisdom, this is greatly appealing to me! I'll have to read on to see how she develops it past that, though.

<h4 id="org4286fe4">The Organization is Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4286fe4">
<p>
Okay, after my crabby opening, I've spent most of this post talking about what's good in this book's first chapter, and by the word count, you can tell there was a lot! But the bad is real, and it mostly comes down to organization. Now, before I dive into this, I should likely point out that I'm an explainer. As this post itself shows, along with those on <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">Spengler</a>, and the Peterson post linked above, I like to take the thoughts from others that I've found worthwhile and try to work out how they might more readily be shared and understood. On top of that, my day job is explaining how to communicate in a business context. For business writing, the goal is to get your information across in as few words as you can manage, and with an organization that makes understanding them as easy as possible. Now, is that the end-all, be-all of writing? Of course not. But it's what I default to, and it means that when I see something I think would benefit from even just a bit of that structure and clarity, it's like nails on a chalkboard.
</p>

<p>
Let me give an example of what I mean. You look at the table of contents, and it seems like this is exactly the kind of well-organized book I'm looking for. Here's chapter 1:
  1: The Books of Old
   1.1: The Forgotten Manuscript (Poetic Edda)
        List of Edda Poems
   1.2: Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda and Ynglinga Saga
   1.3: Gylfaginning The Revelation of the Sorcerer
   1.4: Skaldskaparmal - Hidden Meanings in Poetical Metaphors
   1.5: Hidden in Plain Sight - What Snorri Could Not Say
   1.6: Other Sources to Old Norse Mythology
   1.7: My Methods of Interpretation
   1.8: Gender as a Mythical Formula and Some Other Observations
   1.9: That Which is Disguised in Runes
</p>

<p>
Looks straightforward enough, right? There's even numbered sub-sections, just like in a technical manual! As I have discovered over the past several months of trying to dip into this book here and there based on just that table of contents, though, it is misleading. Key points that you think ought to be covered under a heading aren't there. The section isn't always <i>really</i> about what the heading implies it is. The stuff under the heading is meandering and hits on a lot of kind-of-related things. I mentioned above that Kvilhaug's use of gender as an interpretive framework matches Peterson's pretty well, and there's another way she reminds me of Peterson: both have chosen to tackle big, messy, densely interlinked fields, where every one thing relates to many other things, and there's no easy way to define a clear start, middle, and end. So, I can feel for the lack of organization, I really can. Peterson, though, is only that way in his talks. For his books, he has disciplined himself to edit ruthlessly and structure robustly. Kvilhaug has apparently <i>not</i> learned this particular trick, as much of her writing reads like an "off the top of my head" talk, with the same quality of finding and following tangents where they might lead. Luckily, as I've stressed above, most of these are <i>interesting</i> and <i>worthwhile</i> tangents, but tangents nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
So, for this chapter, one section in particular stood out as a good example of what I mean. "1.7 My Methods of Interpretation" is itself divided into the sub-sub-headers "Comparative Mythology," "That By Which A Thing Is Known," "The Meaning of Names," "Reading Myth as a Parable," "The Formula is the Key," "Truth or Fiction? The Eyes that See," "Do the Myths Represent Common Beliefs or the Beliefs of Spiritual Elites?" Each of these is at the same level of hierarchy. You'll notice above that I took the liberty of re-organizing these when I presented them, because I found this actively hindered my understanding. Skimming through, I assumed her interpretative method had seven components, and that comparative mythology was one of them. Instead, what I found was that "Comparative Mythology" was a section explaining how she <i>won't</i> be using that in this book, "Reading Myth as a Parable" was really an introduction to the concept in "The Formula is the Key," and that both "Truth or Fiction? The Eyes that See" and "Do the Myths Represent Common Beliefs or the Beliefs of the Spiritual Elite?" were talking about the different layers of meaning and Kvilhaug's preference for the estoeric symbolism level of meaning. All of this confusion could have been solved by some formatting, some different header names, and some shuffling around. And that's not even touching a more fundamental edit to the writing itself, which almost certainly would have helped even more. This doorstop of a book could likely have been 1/2 - 3/4 the length and still absolutely brimming with worthwhile insights. This alternate reality book I have in mind could have been one of the absolute best ever written on understanding Norse myth. Hence my hair-pulling in the lead-in.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the chapter ends with three sections that don't just read like transcripts of off-the-cuff talks, they <i>are</i> transcripts of off-the-cuff talks. I'm not totally sure why they were here. They give some examples of what Kvilhaug spelled out in the interpretation section, but they don't add much that is new, and just dropping in barely-edited transcripts of Youtube talks is not how you write well (again, the Idhunn book is <i>all</i> that, and it's maddening). I think either weaving some examples into her explanations of her methods, or else just having a section called "an example of applying these methods" that she wrote for the book, would have been much more helpful.

<p>
Altogether, this book has a <i>lot</i> to recommend it, but it takes a certain amount of energy to grapple with in anything but the most casual way. I sincerely wish Kvilhaug had some kind of partner of the organizational, attention-to-detail variety who shared her passion for these myths. Then we could have things like a list of all of the major Gods, Goddesses, and steads with their names translated, to be used as a reference when reading. We could have chapters and sections that can be looked up as needed, rather than having to be sifted out of the entire 600-page web. We could have lists of the formulas she's identified with pointers to what myths you can find them in. Such glorious possibilities! Alas, for now, I'll have to settle for making my own sense of what she has to offer and sharing what I find with you.

Though I only read this book the year before last, it's done a lot to shape my thinking since. I'll likely need to look back on it later, but for now I'd like to write this out to help set its ideas in my mind more strongly. This book did two main worthwhile things for me: 1. It gave me a helpful framework for thinking about economics that all my earlier reading lacked, and 2. it laid out in enough depth for me to feel like I understand the challenges we are likely to face with energy going forward. So, if those sound like something you might also find helpful, let's dig into <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition-john-michael-greer/17786245?ean=9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as If Survival Mattered</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfe5e3b">
<p>
First off, let's take a tick to talk about "why economics?" In a comment on a <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3514">post</a>, ESR called microeconomics an intellectual "swiss-army knife". I think this is an apt metaphor in more ways than one. For one, economic thinking is made up of a handful of principles that you apply in different situations: the law of supply and demand, costs vs price, marginal utility, and so forth. For another, that handful of principles can be used in many situations for many different purposes, sometimes where you wouldn't expect it, like how Game Theory was built out of hyper-simplified models of what folks do and don't want and how they might act, and yet those models give some valuable insight into decision-making in situations of uncertainty. Lastly, though, like a Swiss Army knife, economic thinking pays for its versatility and broad usefulness by very firmly being <i>not</i> the right specialized tool for really any specific situation. Even in it's notional field of expertise, buying and selling, if you set out to run a business with only microeconomics as your guide, you're gonna have a bad time. I say all of this to put much of the below in a bit of context, and to explain why the second half of the review isn't really about economics at all, but physics.

Next, you might be saying to yourself "hold on, John Michael Greer? Isn't he that druid guy you were <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#how_i_came_to_believe_what_i_do">talking about</a>? What does he know about economics?" And yes, it's true - Greer is by no means an economist, which has some drawbacks for a book on economics, but also some upsides.

<h5 id="orgc78339f">There's a good reason experts are skeptical of outsider opinions on their field</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc78339f">
<p>
First off, the drawbacks. Folks who are knowledgeable in a field are often wary of outsiders coming around and telling them their business. Professional economists have spent years learning ways to think about what they study, reading the articles and books that have been published, doing their own research, and so forth. There's a whole lot of background knowledge that you can only really pick up by years of being up to your eyeballs in a field. Outsiders are likely to lack this kind of background knowledge, to put forward as new ideas that have long since been talked over in the field, and to make the kind of mistakes that the experts have learned to avoid.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgaa0a4f2">
<p>
On the other hand, outsiders can bring a worthwhile way of looking at things to a field. All that background knowledge we just talked about also leads to folks in a field trying to work things out the same way. Those ideas that have been talked over and thrown out might not have been because they are <i>wrong</i>, but because they don't draw research grants, or are politically unacceptable, or because the guy who first put it forward was a jerk. Lastly, for economics specifically, let's remember that most of the seminal works of economics were not written by "professional economists" - back when it was still called "political economy" (likely a more useful term, see below for more on this), philosophers and gentleman felt quite up to sharing their thoughts on how goods and services work, and we're all better off for it. So maybe Greer's wider, non-expert view has something we'd be better off with as well.

<h4 id="org39dcc0f">A Quick Aside on "Political Economy"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org39dcc0f">
<p>
If I had worked out how to sidebars with my current blog settings, that's likely what this would be, but we'll just have to settle for an awkwardly set heading here. In this book, Greer talks about the older term for what we now call "economics," which was "political economy." If you'd like to get a preview of his thinking on this, check out <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/introduction-political-economy/">this post</a>, and for some examples of less well-known ways of thinking about political economy, check out <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/reimagining-political-economy/">this one</a>. At any rate, Greer prefers "political economy" to "economics" for the field at large, because the allocation of scarce resources is <i>always</i> a political question. Many modern economists act like there are "objective" or "scientific" ways to structure economies, but that only holds under certain value assumptions - the current one being something like "the currency-denominated value of assets should be maximized," often with a flavoring of "the most people should have as much money as possible." These value assumptions would look very strange to a daimyo under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate">Tokugawa Shogunate</a>. The point is that wealth is for the benefit of folks, and <i>which</i> folks get <i>how much</i> wealth in <i>what</i> ways are weighty questions, questions that get settled by power. Which makes them <i>political</i> questions. So even the most "objective" economic assessment can only be treated as such within a particular political and value framework - taking a moment to be aware of that framework can help clarify some seemingly "economic" questions.

<h4 id="org074a7fa">What Do We Mean by "Wealth" Anyway?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org074a7fa">
<p>
Before we launch into talking about the three economies Greer proposes in his framework, it's helpful to think about the word "wealth" and what we mean when we use it. These days, if we don't think about it much, we tend to say "wealth" and mean "money" or "things valued in money." But the word actually goes back to <i>weal</i>, which you sometimes will hear in old timey writing put against its opposite woe. If you go even further back, it's from the same PIE root as "will." So, "wealth" grew out of a meaning something like "to have the things you need for the well-being you would will for yourself." Money is a useful economic tool, but it also can hide this ground truth: that true "wealth" is that which lets folks live happy, healthy lives. This wider meaning will be helpful to keep in mind as we go through the framework below.

<h4 id="org8763aed">The Secondary Economy - Goods and Services</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8763aed">
<p>
Okay, now that we are on the same leaf about "wealth," I'm gonna start in the middle and talk about the Secondary Economy first. This is what's most familiar to us when we talk about "economics" - the economy of goods and services. The traditional tools of economics are pretty good at analyzing this kind of thing - supply and demand curves, marginal utility, all that jazz. For reasons that will become clear as we go, I'd like to bring in the example of a farmer. He plants his grain in the spring, tends to it over the summer as it grows, and harvests it in the fall, before taking it to market to sell. All of this work makes wealth as we've defined it - with his work, folks get to eat, without it, they don't. Economic tools will do a good job helping us understand things like the effects of importing foreign grain, if he switched to a different crop, the impacts of fuel costs on his profits, and so forth. This is the stuff economics was developed to handle, and it handles it rather well. The main wellsprings of trouble here are that 1. wealth ends up getting abstracted into dollars, even where it is hard to pin down exact amounts, and because of this, 2. stuff that is harder to measure in dollars tends to get ignored or abstracted, and lastly 3. the very success of these tools in this field ends up tempting us to think they work just as well in other fields.

<div id="outline-container-orgd67db35" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd67db35">The Tertiary Economy - Financial Instruments</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd67db35">
<p>
Speaking of wielding economic tools in other fields, let's talk about the Tertiary Economy. This is Greer's addition to Schumacher's model, and I think it's a helpful one. The Tertiary Economy is made up of all financial instruments, tokens that notionally refer to something that makes, gives, or holds wealth. Take our farmer. Let's say he has a mortgage on the farm. That mortgage is a financial instrument. To buy the farm to grow food (that is, turn his work into wealth), he needed more money than he had at one time, and so the bank loaned it to him in return for him paying it back with interest. There's a piece of paper (or at least a computer record) of this deal that specifies how much he has to pay by when, and what the bank is allowed to do if he fails to do so (like foreclose and take the farm). So far, so good, right? If everyone had to save up enough money to buy land with cash, a lot fewer folks would be able to afford it. And this particular token is pretty tightly linked to the on-the-ground wealth-making: if the farmer doesn't make money growing and selling food, he can't pay the mortgage, but if he does, he can. Assuming he makes more than that, this is a good deal for everyone, and 30 years later, he owns the farm free and clear and the bank has more money than what it loaned him. The mortgage (token) helped make all this more likely to happen than without it.
</p>

<p>
Okay, but you no doubt are looking for the "but" here, so here it is. Such financial instruments almost always start out as tokens representing some underlying wealth-making thing, and so long as they stay that, there's not too much trouble. Let's go through a bit of history to see what can happen with such tokens, though. Before the invention in the west of modern Joint Stock Companies around 1600, the main way that folks invested in commercial ventures was to put up some money before a voyage, and then at the end of the voyage take a proportional share the profits (hence the word "share" for one unit of stock in a company). Well, some bright folks started saying "hey, instead of cashing out after every voyage, want to roll your profits over into a share in the next trip?" and from there it wasn't that much of a jump to make the entity undertaking the voyages persistent, and the "shares" were in that <i>company</i>, rather than in any one of its voyages. Still, the assumption was that those shares entitled you to a payout at some point (dividends). So far, this is just a way to formalize multiple folks putting up the capital needed to start and run a business and getting paid their fair share for their contributions. Here's where it gets interesting, though. At some point, these shares started being treated as a piece of property. Meaning something you could buy and sell. Which folks started doing. Maybe you need a few thousand bucks now instead of a few hundred every year, so you sell your share to someone who wants the cashflow more than the chunk of cash now. At some point, somebody bought a share and a little later got an offer from someone else wanting to buy it for more than he paid. After a while, more and more people noticed that if you bought shares in a thriving business, a little later you could sell it for more than you bought it for, earning a profit without having to wait for all of those tedious dividend payments to add up.
</p>

<p>
You can probably see where this is going, but let's step back to understand what's going on here formally. <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-model-feedback-loops/">Feedback loops</a> are a handy bit of systems theory to have in your head if you don't already. Some systems make outputs that then change the system's behavior. These come in two flavors: positive and negative. Positive feedback loops take their output and then do more of what they were doing before, getting stronger and stronger. This is not necessarily a good thing, as the classic example shows: feedback between a microphone and speaker (as a former high school sound tech, I tend to take that sound <i>personally</i>). Negative feedback loops, on the other hand, do less of what they're doing as they pick up on their outputs. Here the classic example is your thermostat: once it gets hot or cold enough, it stops putting out hot or cold air. Negative feedback loops are self-terminating by definition, but it turns out positive feedback loops can't keep going forever, either. Instead, they do more and more of what they're doing until the system <i>breaks</i>. If you let a microphone sit in front of a speaker, unless there's a failsafe built in, it will get higher and higher pitched until the speaker blows out.
</p>

<p>
Now we have all the pieces we need to understand why it's helpful to call out the Tertiary economy as its own thing. In the secondary economy, systems are almost always negative feedback loops. Good ol' supply and demand works this way: if I am making a killing selling widgets, you might want to get in on that action, and five other folks, and soon, there's too many widgets and nobody's making any money on them, so a handful drop out of the business, and those left are making decent money, but the price for the buyers isn't insane. Remember how I said that formal economic tools get used where they're less well-suited? This is a big part of why. Those tools were developed to analyze and understand <i>negative</i> feedback loops. But guess what? That dynamic we sketched out for financial instruments is a <i>positive</i> feedback loop. You know what we call positive feedback loops in finance?
</p>

<p>
<i>Bubbles</i>.
</p>

<p>
The perception that you can buy these instruments and sell them for more later creates demand for the instruments, which drives up their price, which makes more people think they can get rich by buying now and selling later, which further drives up the price, and so forth. Until enough folks look around and think "okay, this is good enough, I'm gonna sell" - which then drives <i>another</i> positive feedback loop in the other direction. Now, the instruments are getting sold, which ups their supply, which drives down the price, which makes more folks want to get out before the price falls further, and so on, and the bubble pops.
</p>

<p>
As it happens, this is how the 2008 financial crisis happened. You can skip this paragraph if you know the story. Mortgages had traditionally been given by local banks to folks who actually wanted to live in the house they bought, and the banks were careful about taking on a loan with such a long term, so they vetted applicants pretty thoroughly. This led to mortgages being seen as rock-solid financial instruments well-tied to the secondary economy, and therefore not subject to becoming a bubble. Unfortunately, this very perception led some folks to create <i>new</i> financial instruments that were tokens of bundles of mortgages, and then sell these as "super safe." As you might imagine, "guaranteed safe returns" is something that <i>everyone</i> wants, and so those new bundles became a hot commodity. This drove up demand for the underlying mortgages. Which meant banks started looking for ways to give more people mortgages. What most of them hit on was making it way easier to get a mortgage, loaning to folks who wouldn't have been considered credit-worthy before. At first, this was subtle, but over time, it got to where banks were issuing loans with <i>zero</i> verification of the applicant's claims about things like income and assets. The easy availability of mortgages meant more folks started buying homes, which drove up their price. Folks started noticing that they could sell their house for more than they got it for, and so folks started buying houses <i>expressly</i> to sell them, not to live in them. Through financial sorcery, the safest, most mundane bit of the secondary economy got turned into a bubble. And then it popped.
</p>

<p>
So, economists look at things like the stock market or derivatives trading or the like, and they see that you have pieces of property traded in a market that are valued in dollars, and they think traditional secondary economy tools will work to understand them. And they do - to a point. But it is precisely the insanity of a full-throttle bubble that those tools are not made to handle, and that's arguably the most important thing about financial instruments. So, it's helpful to know that this bit of the economy works differently, and to have the tools to think about it. The tertiary economy is capable of "creating" vast amounts of <i>money</i>, whether or not it represents <i>wealth</i>, and that's the trouble.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0532f62">
<p>
Alright, why have I saved the Primary Economy for last? Because talking about the other two economies has helped give us the grounding we need to understand something a little counter-intuitive. You see, the Primary Economy is both the most important of the three, and also the one economic tools are the least well-suited to analyze. The Primary Economy is all of the wealth given to us by nature. Our farmer? Yes, he needs to work to plant, care for, and harvest his crops, but the sun shines for free. The dirt holds nutrients and microbes that help the plants grow. The rain waters the crops. The air gives the carbon the plants need to build themselves. <i>Every</i> economic activity we do is embedded in this wider world of free wealth. The way I like to drive this home is to bring up the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_and_Afraid">Naked and Afraid</a>.

All of this stuff is obviously a big part of wealth as we've defined it, but it's almost impossible to measure in dollars. It's also <i>so</i> ubiquitous that we take it for granted. And yet we can affect this economy - composting and other methods can enhance the wealth the soil can bring forth. Forestry can make sure we have healthy forests and timber. Paying attention to ecosystems and taking care of them can have ripple effects literally up and downstream. Planting mangroves can ward off the worst hurts brought by hurricanes. Also, unluckily, we can screw it up by <i>not</i> doing these things.

<h3 id="orge92604b">Energy and Concentration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge92604b">
<p>
One of the biggest gifts of the Primary Economy has been fossil fuels. Plants used the energy in sunlight to pull carbon out of the air and into their bodies. Some of those got eaten by animals, and some of both ended up at the bottoms of seas or swamps or the like, and for millions of years, the pressure of titanic slabs of rock squashed them into oil, coal, and so forth. It is not an overstatement to say that the Industrial Revolution and everything it brought could not have happened without fossil fuels. I've linked it before, but Wait But Why has a pretty good <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">break down</a> of the mind-blowing amounts of energy fossil fuels have let humans harness. I'm less sanguine on what alternative energy technologies will let us do than Tim, but I'll get into that below. The point is that fairly readily available fossil fuels have let mankind spend the last ~300 years seeing what we can accomplish when we use huge amounts of outside energy to make things easier for humans, and a lot of the outcomes are pretty darn impressive. But mark that premise, as it turns out to be a doozy.

<h4 id="org46b44d6">Energy as the Ur-Resource</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org46b44d6">
<p>
It turns out if you look at societies throughout time and around the world, energy is the master resource that sets the bounds on how much an economy can produce. For most of history, that energy has been human and animal muscle, burning wood, and a smattering of wind/water power. The real turning point of the Industrial Revolution was that it allowed energy to become <i>versatile</i>. All of a sudden, you could turn <i>burning</i> into movement. Take a tick and think about how <i>weird</i> that really is - burning some long-dead plankton can get you a few hundred miles in a few hours. Burning more of that dead plankton can sew your clothes, <i>cool</i> your house (coolth from fire!), put up a skyscraper, and now even write (bad) poems. Every economy has been limited by how much energy it could muster and what kinds of work it could be put to, but the industrial world's economy has let us muster <i>a lot</i> and put it to <i>very many</i> uses, and so it has grown very, very big.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org29ea9bb" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org29ea9bb">Amount of Energy vs Concentration of Energy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org29ea9bb">
<p>
There's a catch, though. It's not just <i>amount</i> of energy that matters. Fans of solar are fond of pointing out how very much energy hits the planet in the form of sunlight every day, which is absolutely true. Unluckily, that energy is very diffuse. It turns out that <i>most</i> of the really interesting stuff you can do with energy needs that energy to be concentrated. On its own, sunlight can do a lot of helpful things - make plants grow, heat things up slowly, help us see (duh). With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_still">little more work</a>, you can do some neat stuff like turn wine into brandy. But to make sunlight do all the tricks we've grown used to making energy do, it has to be concentrated. Right now, the best ways we know how to do that are by growing plants and photovoltaics. Plants <i>barely</i> concentrate energy, as charcoal doesn't get you as far as fossil coal, and photovoltaics take a lot of energy-intensive inputs to make. To put that in plain speech, right now, the only way photovoltaics get made is in factories running on burning fossil fuels. If you were required to make photovoltaic panels using only energy concentrated by photovoltaic panels, you would be spending more energy than you're making - it's a net energy sink. And that's to say nothing of the problem of <i>storing</i> the energy so generated, and as everyone who has ever owned a laptop or a cellphone knows all too well, batteries suck. What made fossil fuels a wonder was not at first how <i>much</i> energy there was, but rather how <i>concentrated</i> it was.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgf7b29f6">Concentrating Energy takes More Energy than is Concentrated</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf7b29f6">
<p>
Okay, so we need concentrated energy to run an industrial economy - if we have super abundant diffuse energy in the form of sunlight or wind, why don't we just concentrate it? Well, putting energy into a physical form that can hold energy is a process that itself <i>takes energy</i>. Thanks to physics's biggest downer, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, any such process will be subject to entropy and lose some of the energy being concentrated in some kind of waste - light, heat, or whatever. That means that <i>any</i> process that can concentrate energy takes more of an energy input than it produces as an output. In the case of fossil fuels, the energy input for concentrating them was given by the combination of gravity and trillions of tons of rock sitting on top of them for millenia. All of that was actually way more energy than ended up stored in oil, coal, and the rest, but since it happened very long ago and needed no help from humans (we weren't even around yet), it seems like all that energy was "free." And we've been living high on the hog off that bounty for the last few hundred years, building stupendous wonders, birthing more humans than have ever been on the Earth at one time, and making many of those folks richer and healthier than anyone had been for at least hundreds of years before, maybe ever.

<h3 id="org6c08c4d">Where Does All This Leave Us?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c08c4d">
<p>
Here's where I may lose those of y'all who are techno-optimists. So far, we haven't found any concentrated energy sources as useful as fossil fuels. Fission power has been tried in a wide variety of states with very different regulatory regimes, and yet has never worked without a lot of subsidies. Fusion power has been coming "any day now" for longer than I've been alive. And we're getting to the point where fossil fuels are harder and harder to get to, because we already dug up the easy stuff. Technologies like fracking take far more energy input than conventional wells, which means more of the energy we're pulling out of the ground is being used to, you know, pull energy out of the ground. At some point, that becomes a losing proposition. All of which means that I've come to the distinctly uncomfortable conclusion that the exponential growth in technology we've been enjoying in the modern era is likely to come to an end, and the future will be something very different than most folks imagine. Of course, I could be wrong - maybe fusion really <i>is</i> right around the corner this time, or maybe every government that has tried fission has handicapped it in similar ways. I don't know, but I hope whether you agree with this last bit or not that you find the Three Economies framework and the model of thinking about energy in both amount and concentration as helpful in making sense of the world as I have.

<h2 id="what_might_we_learn_from_revival_druidry" class="Post">What Might We Learn From Revival Druidry?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what_might_we_learn_from_revival_druidry">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-July-15
</p>

<p>
Now that I've laid out <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#a_quick_grounding_in_revival_druidry">what Revival Druidry is</a>, I reckon that sets us up to talk
about what we might learn from it as a religion. Specifically, I'd like to take
a look at how such a small, weird set of beliefs has been able to keep chugging
along for three hundred years. If you read that last post before I had a chance
to update it, I was mistaken on one key point: I said that the Druid Revival got
where it is today without ever being a fad the way Wicca and Neopaganism were
for the past few decades. It turns out that Druidry has, in fact, had its own
booms and busts, the biggest of which was in the first half of the nineteenth
century. Even still, I think Druidry makes for a good case study because those
fads didn't kill it the way Theosophy's or Spiritualism's did.
</p>

<p>
One reason I'm interested is that I got into alternative spirituality right
smack in the <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/the-twilight-of-the-neopagan-era/">Twilight of the Neopagan Era</a>. Greer's essay linked there spells it
all out, but the short version is that starting in 1979, Neopaganism ballooned
in popularity, attracted a bunch of folks <i>because</i> it was popular for a while,
and now that all the sexy young folks have become boring old folks, it is
fading. In other words, the same trend that Spiritualism and Theosophy followed.
Now, there are still a handful of Theosophical reading rooms and Spiritualist
mediums running around, but by-and-large, these movements did not do a great job
surfing their wave of popularity into a smooth landing as a stable minority
religion. Druidry did. Since I would like my own fringe beliefs to have a shot
at helping folks out in the long run, I thought it would be worthwhile to take a
look at Druidry and try to pull out what characteristics allowed it to do so.
Like Ringo, I <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/239596.html?thread=41991148#cmt41991148">get by with a little help from my friends</a>, so my list has some
inputs from John Michael Greer and others.

<h3 id="org912d8a4">Meeting an Unmet Spiritual Need</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org912d8a4">
<p>
First and most importantly, for any religion to do well in the long run, it
needs to, you know, <i>be a religion</i>. By which I mean it needs to give a solid way
for its followers to interact with the divine and find meaning through that
interaction. One thing that tends to help a fringe religion find a niche is to
reach the divine in a way that the mainstream religions around it lack. As you
might guess, Druidry's way to the divine is through the natural world. When the
Druid Revival got going in early 18th century Britain, the two main systems of
belief on offer were orthodox Anglican Christianity or the burgeoning Scientific
Materialism. Neither had much use for nature as a path to seek transcendence. If
you're anything like me, you've stood somewhere filled with beauty, like Muir
Woods, or looked up at a stunning sunset, and felt the touch of something
greater. Druidry celebrates such moments and invites us to seek them out, even
to notice them more often. Watching a roly-poly trundle over tiny rocks, sticks,
and leaf litter can hold as much wonder as the mightiest settings, if you let
it. There's nothing new about finding the divine in nature - most every religion
throughout time has had hallowed groves, blessed waterfalls, and other steads of
undeniable beauty and power. But in the land where the Industrial Revolution was
about to be born, neither of the main streams of belief at hand had much use for
such things, and many Englishmen felt that lack keenly and went looking for a
way to fill it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org96145fa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org96145fa">Taking Shape Around a Key Image</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org96145fa">
<p>
What these men found to fill that lack were the <i>very</i> few traces of elder Druidry
found in classical writing - a time or two in Caesar, another handful in
Tacitus, some wondering-out-loud in Posidonius, and that was about it. Take a
tick to put yourself in the shoes of an English gentleman, learning the
classics, and just think of the thrill whenever far-off and mist-shrouded
Britannia comes up. If that same gentleman also felt the divine most keenly
while walking through the woods or seeing the sun rise over the moor, then how
much more bewitching the glimpses of wise druids gathered in their sacred
groves, must have been. These days, what we have since learned about the elder
Celts and their druids makes clear that the image of druids conjured by the
revivalists was rather unlike the true elder druids, but <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_trouble_with_authenticity">as we've said before</a>,
maybe that's not such a big deal. For however off the mark their rebuilding of
the past might have been, what they <i>did</i> find was a set of beliefs, practices,
concepts, and imagery that spoke to the need for nature spirituality in the
British (and later, English-speaking) world. Something about being a <i>druid</i>,
rather than just a chap that likes to sit out in the woods, spoke to something
deep within these folks, and it still has the power to stir strong feelings
today.

<h3 id="orgaae5f4a">Having Leeway Around a Set Core</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaae5f4a">
<p>
While druids rallied around the core image of the ancient druids, the very
scantness of what was known left a lot of room for filling in the gaps. Also,
many folks over time and throughout Britain, at least somewhat independently,
seem to have landed on becoming a "druid." Lots of far-flung folks putting these
scraps together meant that many unalike takes on druidry got cooked up and only
later brought together. Lastly, these folks were pretty much all weirdos and
self-willed thinkers who deeply felt the need for going your own way and doing
your own thing. Take all of these things together and what you get is that for
as long as there have been revival druids, there has been a lot of variation in
what they believe. Many (maybe even most?) druids have been Christians, though,
of course, the not-so-orthodox kind. Some leaned into their classical schooling
and worshiped the Greek Gods. Still others dug into the Welsh or Irish writings
to find the pre-Christian Gods of those lands and began worshiping them. Heck,
some druids in the 20th century even made up some Gods and were shocked when
they seemed to get an answer! A joke I've heard Greer tell many times is "ask
three druids, get five answers." The point is that around a shared heart of
finding the divine through nature, druids have welcomed a broad range of
beliefs.

<h3 id="orge66a126">Walking the Walk</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge66a126">
<p>
As I've said before, though, Druidry is far less about what you <i>believe</i> and much
more about what you <i>do</i>, and has been since pretty much the beginning. Maybe this
came about through give-and-take between folks with unalike beliefs trying to
come together. Maybe it's a natural outgrowth of the emphasis on individual
experience and understanding. Wherever it springs from, druids have always put
more weight on practice than on dogma. Sure, druids have developed philosophies
and teachings about the world, how it came to be, and what kind of divine forces
shape it. Many of these teachings have even come close to being held among all
druids, such as the belief in <i>Awen</i> (pronounced roughly "Ah-oh-en"): a spark of
the groundmost wellspring of Being held within each of us that drives how we
think and feel and make. But reading about Awen, talking about Awen, even
understanding Awen, pales next to <i>living in a way that is shaped by your own
Awen</i>. Reading Iolo Morganwg's <i>Barddas</i> doesn't make you a druid, but bethinking
on the threads you find there might. Drawing up and labeling an ecosystem
doesn't make you a druid, but using your understanding of how ecosystems work to
steer cleanup work in the nearby woods or wetlands might. Knowing the dates of
the solstices and equinoxes doesn't make you a druid, but coming together with a
handful of other druids to welcome each turn of the wheel of the year might.

<h3 id="orga07e841">Worshiping Right Out in the Open</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga07e841">
<p>
Speaking of rituals, from very early days, druids have often made sure to do
their rituals out where everyone can see them. Now, sure, some of this is thanks
to the outdoors being the best place to worship and feel bonded with nature. But
it was also a way to show folks what they were up to. Worshiping in the open had
a couple of helpful outcomes. For one, seeing rituals helped folks learn that
there even was such a thing as druidry. Those who might want to give it a shot
could readily get in touch with the druids they had seen in the park at
midsummer, making public rituals a way to bring aboard new druids. Maybe even
weightier, though, was that public rituals showed folks what druids were <i>not</i> up
to. No animal sacrifice. No naughty sex stuff. No devil worship. Just some odd
fellows in robes chanting about peace and the sun and excalibur and so forth.
This second reason may have been key to druidry's keeping alive - fringe
spiritual movements <i>start out</i> under a cloud and have to show themselves not to
be shady. We all know the stereotype of a scary cult, and with good reason.
Without the weight of tradition to help, new religions have to go to greater
lengths to show they're on the up-and-up, and truthfully, maybe that's for the
best. For a very long time, druids have made sure to make it clear what they're
up to and what they're <i>not</i> up to. The upshot? When was the last time you heard
someone put forth that a wicked cabal of druids is pulling the strings of the
mighty to evil ends? That's right, never.

<h3 id="org8f71184">Using Frumpery as a Shield</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f71184">
<p>
Above, you might have thought I was being silly to bring up "naughty sex stuff,"
but truthfully, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/sex-and-occultism-part-one-mrs-grundy-and-the-great-god-pan/">for some time there was quite a lot of overlap</a> between
alternative spirituality and sex. If you don't check out the linked post (again
by Greer), the short take is that for a long time in Christian lands, men could
get away with sleeping around so long as they were fairly discreet, but women
could not. During Victorian times, a new answer was hit upon: if you wrapped up
the shady sex in shady magic, both man and woman now had dirt on each other -
mutually assured social destruction. The man would be just as harmed by it
coming out that he was doing spells as the woman would be by it coming out that
she was doing sex. This blend of magic and alternative spirituality slowly lost
importance as sexual mores loosened, and was killed off pretty thoroughly after
the sexual revolution. Druidry got going before this innovation and seems never
to have had much to do with it.
</p>

<p>
When Neopaganism hurtled into high gear after Halloween 1979 (the date that both
<i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> and <i>The Spiral Dance</i> were published), it had more than a
little sex baked into its scene. Drawing on both the alternative spirituality
scene with its background of magically-themed sex clubs as well as on the
counterculture movement and its close alignment with the sexual revolution, one
of the things that helped Neopaganism get and keep its popularity was a culture
of fairly widespread casual sex. Druidry wasn't really catering to those
yearnings, and so it was seen by most folks flocking to the Neopagan scene as
old-fashioned, stodgy, and boring. So far fewer newly-minted spiritual explorers
found their way into (Revival) Druidry than other ways of belief like Wicca.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that this might have been a blessing. When any kind of movement or
scene becomes a fad, the folks who flock to it are mostly looking for a good
time. The folks who shaped that movement or scene are then faced with a strong
pull to tweak things to give these new seekers the good time they're looking
for. The more folks who show up, the less they'll have in common besides wanting
to find a good time, and so the movement finds itself more-and-more pulled to
put forth whatever has the widest draw. Even worse, if folks in the scene heed
that it has become hip, they may start shooting for growth for its own sake. The
trouble is that these outsiders found themselves drawn to the scene <i>because</i> it
was unlike the mainstream or other scenes they might have gone to. If the scene
goes too hard for being all things to all folks, well, it wipes out what made it
stand out in the first stead, and it starts to lose those who showed up for a
new, different good time, and maybe even those folks who made it special to
begin with. On the other hand, if you can hold off the siren call of popularity,
if you <i>don't</i> make the most of being a fad, and instead you keep up "flake
filters" that gently send on their way folks who don't want to do the work, you
might see a <i>slight</i> bump from becoming better known, but you also won't be left
with nobody when the fad rolls back.

<h3 id="org53eb928">Learning from Druidry</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org53eb928">
<p>
So, what can budding alternative spiritual movements learn from Druidry? Well,
so long as their goal is not to take over the world or grow as fast as they
might, but instead to meet the spiritual needs of a small group for the long
haul, rather a lot. First, make sure that whatever you are putting out there
meets a real spiritual need, even better if its one that no one else is meeting
right now. Second, to meet that need, call upon a strong aesthetic that grabs
folks and fires their imaginations. Third, set out a heart of belief and
practice that meets that spiritual need, but leave everything else as bendsome
as you can get away with. Fourth, make one bit of that shared core a weight on
practice over belief. Fifth, do some chunk of your practices out in the open to
draw in those who may want to come onboard and soothe those who look askance at
what you're doing. Sixth and lastly, steer away from being too sexy, cool, or
"of the moment" - shoot instead for those things that are timeless and look for
ways that take some amount of work from those who would come into your movement.
I'd be shocked if this list hit everything it might have, but I hope it's a good
starting point for thinking about what a religious movement should (or
shouldn't) look like. That being said, I'd love to hear anything you think I've
missed or gotten wrong.

<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-June-29
</p>

<p>
Following on from my posts on <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_trouble_with_authenticity">authenticity</a> and <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#how_i_came_to_believe_what_i_do">how I came to believe what I do</a>, I wanted to talk a bit about one of the lesser known bits of the path I'm following: Revival Druidry. It's a religious movement that has not always been exactly authentic, but has somehow managed to prove valid to a number of folks for around 300 years now, all while being almost entirely unknown outside of some very niche circles. Throughout the history of the English-speaking world, there have been plenty of alternative spiritual movements, and America has leaned into that trend with gusto. Brownists, Levelers, Quakers, Puritans, Swedenborgians, Spiritualists, Fundamentalists, Neopagans and more. Some, like the Puritans and Quakers, splintered off of the mainstream religion, rose to prominence, and then either mutated into unrecognizable shapes or faded away. Others, like Spiritualism or Theosophy, rode the wave of popular enthusiasm for seemingly brand new spiritual insights and rewards, before collapsing almost as quickly. Still others, like Fundamentalist Christianity, have risen and fallen along with other trends in the wider society.
</p>

<p>
Revival Druidry, though, has walked a far different path - it's just kind of kept on going, never very big, never very popular, but quietly fulfilling the spiritual needs of a small group of weirdos for <i>three centuries</i>, without being noticed <i>at all</i> by the mainstream. Whatever else Revival Druidry is, it's remarkable for pulling this off. So let's take a look at what Revival Druidry is and has been, and maybe start to understand what has allowed it to flourish amongst the cracks and crevices of the English-speaking world, thriving in its quiet way. <i>Edit: Embarrassingly enough, John Michael Greer informs me that Druidry has had its own booms and busts, the biggest of which was in the early 19th century. I think most of my thoughts still stand, but it is perhaps not as singular as I thought.</i>

<h3 id="org701882a">My Own Path with Revival Druidry - From What the Heck Is This? to Why the Heck Not?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org701882a">
<p>
My first exposure to druidry as anything besides a feature of <a href="https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/09/7-myths-everyone-believes-about-druids.html">D&amp;D campaigns</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid">ancient history</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wicker_Man">pop culture</a> was in Isaac Bonewits's book <i>Real Magic</i>, which I found through the ESR essay I linked in the post on my beliefs, or maybe a reply to a comment somewhere on his blog. I can't really recommend Bonewits's work these days (though the bibliography is still pretty good), but finding a seemingly reasonable person in the world of woo was very helpful to get started. In that book, Bonewits lays out a taxonomy of polytheists, dividing them into Paleopagans, Mesopagans, and Neopagans (I can't remember if he coined "Neopagan", but he might have). Paleopagans are folks who follow or followed polytheistic religious traditions that were wholly organic - Ancient Greeks, modern Hindus, and so forth. Most of us know these days what a "Neopagan" is - folks who have adopted a polytheistic religion of one kind or another in the recent past, separate from their wider cultural context. Mesopagans are what he called those folks who tried to bring back various polytheistic belief systems between the rise of Christianity and before the twentieth century.
</p>

<p>
Seems reasonable enough as a way to label things, right? Well, the thing is, Bonewits did not propose this framework without some self-interest. You see, he was the founder of a Neopagan religious organization that seeks to reconstruct the beliefs and practices of the ancient Druids of the Celtic world - <a href="https://www.adf.org/">Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF)</a>, and so had some interest in how polytheistic believers identified themselves and others. There was just one problem - there were already folks running around calling themselves "Druids," and the alternative spirituality scene is small enough that this caused some consternation. So, Bonewits set about describing how the Mesopagans were deficient in various ways - they lacked the knowledge of ancient beliefs gained through more recent scholarship, they borrowed Christian beliefs and practices, and much else that Bonewits didn't truck with. So, you see, ADF and similar more recent reconstructionists are the <i>real</i> druids, not those fellows in the <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.9cd6a94866b550d8644c8618b87c7b67?rik=YDrMpuOa%2bswjtw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.infinite-beyond.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2f033_john_michael_greer-214x300.jpg&amp;ehk=%2fFR7%2bLucrGg1N%2fkB2CNrM%2fXWLniXw7WGwJFbsHAGQ7Y%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0">funny headgear</a>.

<p>
As I set out in my post on authenticity, at that point of my journey, this made plain good sense to me, and so I pretty much dismissed these older druids without even considering them, especially since I was more interested in Germanic myth and belief anyway. Well, not too long after this is when my friend introduced me to John Michael Greer's work (that was JMG in the nemyss link, by the way). Greer is an enthusiastic and influential Revival Druid - he was the head of the <a href="https://aoda.org/">Ancient Order of Druids in America</a> for twelve years and helped build it from an almost defunct handful of old folks into a thriving organization. At first, I thought this was kind of a silly way to go about religion, but it didn't make a big difference since I thought it was all in our heads anyway. As I read more and more of his work, though, I came to respect him quite a bit as an even-handed, thoughtful man with his own deep beliefs, who nevertheless refuses to push them on anyone who doesn't want them. It was Greer's writing that got me to <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-world-full-of-gods-an-inquiry-into-polytheism-john-michael-greer/18731823?ean=9781801520805">seriously consider the reality of spiritual beings</a>, and then to take up a daily magical practice of a banishing ritual, meditation, and divination. I started with a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/26433.html">Heathen variant of the Golden Dawn Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram</a> and <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/31086.html">Middle Pillar Exercise</a>, using the Poetic Edda for meditation threads, and the Runes for divination. After my spiritual awakening, I realized I was going to need a more complete framework to follow, and much to my surprise, divination and prayer suggested that I should do the Revival Druidry thing for awhile, while still worshiping Anglo-Saxon Gods (mostly). So I grabbed Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/druidry-handbook-spiritual-practice-rooted-in-the-living-earth-john-michael-greer/6897332?ean=9781578637461">Druidry Handbook</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-druid-magic-handbook-ritual-magic-rooted-in-the-living-earth-john-michael-greer/6897361?ean=9781578633975">Druid Magic Handbook</a> and got to work.

<h3 id="orgb0d261d">Druidry is All About What You Do, Not What You Believe</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb0d261d">
<p>
At this point, you might be asking yourself "wait, what the heck does being a druid have to do with Woden and Thunor and their lot?" (as an aside - more than you might think. The ancient Celts and Germans were neighbors with shared cultural ancestry, and so had a lot of shared beliefs and practices). Over the years reading Greer, I had come to understand that Revival Druidry is <i>wonderfully</i> flexible. Revival Druidry is more about what you <i>do</i> than about what you <i>believe</i>, and even within this grounding in shared practice, there's room for a whole lot of variation. What holds all of this together are three main themes, as outlined by Greer in <i>The Druidry Handbook</i>: reverence for the land, personal spiritual development, and public ritual. Mark the utter <i>lack</i> of anything in those three threads about which Gods to worship, what kind of clothes to wear, doctrines to follow, and so forth. This has meant that over the last three hundred years there have been Druids who worship Jesus Christ, the Greek Gods, the Earth herself, and much else besides. The shape of their personal development has included prayer, meditation, fasting, asceticism, bacchanalic feasts, and more. The public rituals have held a <i>bit</i> less variety, as that is where Druids actually do come together and agree to do the same thing, at least for a bit. Most of these rituals somehow mark the turning of the year and the changes found in nature that come with it.
</p>

<p>
For myself, this looks like following the paths laid out in Greer's two books I mentioned above, along with the practices in another two volumes of his, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-dolmen-arch-a-study-course-in-the-druid-mysteries-volume-1-the-lesser-mysteries-john-m-greer/18188126?ean=9781935006916">The Dolmen Arch</a>. I've been working on better getting to know the land around me and to do less to harm it (like composting as much of our food and yard waste as we can). As for ritual, I haven't done any publicly yet, but I mark the two solstices and equinoxes as well as the halfway points between them on my own out in my backyard. I wouldn't truly call myself "a druid" just yet, as I haven't finished the self-initiation given in any of these books, but I have settled in fairly comfortably walking "the druid path," at least for a time.
</p>

<p>
Three things led me to following this path that likely all would have shocked me a few years ago. First, Greer's advice that magical newbies should pick a well-defined course of practice and follow it to the letter. Secondly, the weight that Druidry puts on <i>balance</i> called out as something I needed to work on. Lastly, Druidry pulled in a lot of directions I <i>didn't</i> want to go. I know that last one especially doesn't sound like it makes much sense, but I'll unpack all three.
</p>

<p>
Though the exercises I mentioned above got me some plenty impressive outcomes, there was a problem. At the time, that was pretty much all there was to the "Heathen Golden Dawn." Greer was collaborating with one of his readers who was doing the heavy lifting, but not long after putting those up, that reader had to put the project aside and so it wasn't moving for a while. Another reader picked it up and is close to finishing a book detailing a complete beginner's course of study, which is great - but wasn't much help two years ago. The reason this mattered is that Greer <i>very</i> strongly recommends that folks beginning the practice of magic should pick a course of study known to be balanced, effective, and not to turn the lives of folks who follow it into smoking wreckage. Since I trusted Greer, I wanted to follow one of his courses of study, and since the traditional Golden Dawn approach didn't do much for me, that left <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-celtic-golden-dawn-an-original-complete-curriculum-of-druidical-study-john-michael-greer/8762353?ean=9780738731551">The Celtic Golden Dawn</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-druid-magic-handbook-ritual-magic-rooted-in-the-living-earth-john-michael-greer/6897361?ean=9781578633975">The Druid Magic Handbook</a>.
</p>

<p>
It was the second thing I laid out that led me to choose the latter over the former. You see, the Golden Dawn system is all about calling upon spiritual forces from "above" - which is great, and works very well for a lot of folks (and a taste of it had worked great for me!). The system worked out by Greer in the <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>, though, calls upon spiritual forces from above <i>and</i> below. Now, hold your horses. By below, I emphatically do <i>not</i> mean noxious spiritual entities (let's call a spade a spade: demons). Another good habit I have picked up from Greer is to have absolutely no truck with any demonolatry or anyone who practices it. No, by "below," I mean those spiritual forces that come from and flow through the earth - the kind of thing that makes some sites sacred, the life and power that bubbles up in springs, and the drive to <i>live</i> that burns deep in your belly. Many spiritual traditions historically have distrusted or even rejected this source of spirituality (I'm looking at you, Christianity). The terms I have learned for these two currents of spirituality are "Solar" and "Telluric" (telluric comes from a Latin word for Mother Earth, and so means "Earthly"). The Solar Current is very macho: disciplined, exalted, shining, bright, hard. The Telluric Current is more feminine: relaxed, welcoming, dark, warm, soft. Through the spiritual work I had already done, I had realized that I'm naturally a very Solar person, and I'm terribly out of touch with the Telluric. It became clear to me that I needed to bring these into more balance, and that meant learning a whole new ritual framework: the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/tag/sphere+of+protection">Sphere of Protection</a> (which is the heart of what the <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i> teaches).
</p>

<p>
And the third thing that brought me to Druidry comes from putting the above two together: following a Druid course of study, by the book, start-to-finish would make me do many things that I wouldn't choose to do otherwise. Think of working out: most of us (myself very much included) don't much like picking up heavy weights or peddling on the bike or what have you. But if we want to be healthy, we do it anyway. And I needed a spiritual work out. I have two big struggles that both are at least somewhat tied up with leaning so heavily Solar - I like to skip around and I like to skip ahead. By skip around, I mean that I get grabbed by some new interest and then go deep on it for a while, but usually after a few months, it's on to some other interest. With many of these, I come back every once in a while over the years, but there are few crafts or lines of research I've kept up steadily through the years. A book that requires at a <i>minimum</i> a year or two to get through, and more likely 3-5, would be a good dose of stick-to-it-iveness. Linked to this, Druidry is also <i>not</i> the perfectly customized, just-as-I-like-it set of beliefs and practices I would design for myself if given free rein. Again, rather than skipping to some other tradition and/or borrowing the bits of it I like, I'm forced to find the worth in what's presented to me. As for skipping ahead, well, not to preen overmuch, but I'm a pretty smart guy especially about words and propositional knowledge. Book smart, you might say. In the kinds of fields where being book smart is the main thing that counts, you can often find shortcuts - work out the algorithm or the principle behind the specific examples, and you can skip over further examples. That's all well and good where it works, but the trouble is that my being good at that has led me to use that as my default approach at everything and to want to skip past the boring groundwork and get on with the advanced stuff because I "understand" it. Well, again, following a specifically laid out course with the intention of "you have to do all of it, as presented, for as much time as it takes to do it right" gives me a great chance to work on better balancing myself and my spiritual life.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, after two years of following this path, I have found a lot to like about it. There's been plenty of room for my learning about and building my worship around Germanish myth and Gods. I've come to better know and care about the living world around me. For the first time in my life, I've kept up a daily meditation habit for more than a few months. The myths, symbolism, and rituals of druidry have opened up to me and shown me both their own worth, as well as deeper insights into those of my Germanish beliefs. It is a decidedly quirky approach to the spiritual for weirdos who want to go their own way, but don't want to build <i>everything</i> from scratch, and it turns out that suits me very well indeed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga23323a">
<p>
So, I've talked a lot about the role Druidry has played in my own spiritual growth, but not much about what Druidry <i>is</i> or where it came from. Up at the top, I mentioned it has not always been the most authentic religion out there. You see, while Druidry coalesced around a handful of figures throughout the 18th century, one who had an outsized impact was Iolo Morganwg (that's roughly pronounced "Yolo Morganoog"), or Edward Williams as he was known when he wasn't penning Welsh poetry. Morganwg was a Welsh antiquarian and scholar with a passion for medieval Welsh poetry. Throughout his life, he shared works he had discovered that revealed the deep wisdom of the medieval bards who had kept alive the teachings of the ancient Druids. The core philosophical concept was <i>Awen</i> (pronounced closer to "ah-oh-en" than "ah-when") - the single great wellspring of all of Being, that manifests in each and every living thing. This and other teachings were put forth in poetry and stories that he had in his immense collection.
</p>

<p>
The only small trouble was that it came out after he died that much of that wisdom poetry had been written not by medieval bards, but by Iolo himself. He was <i>so good</i> at medieval Welsh poetry that the top scholars in the field didn't work it out until some outside clues helped them piece it together. While some of the work he shared to illuminate his philosophy was actual medieval poetry, a good chunk of it was not. This was of a piece with much of the early Revival - as has been very common among alternative spiritual movements, to try to make themselves appear legitimate, most individuals and groups of early druids claimed to have some kind of real link to the druids of the pre-Christian Celtic world, somehow kept alive in hiding all these long years. Sadly, all of these claims were wholly made up. Every druid was working from the same <i>very</i> sparse scraps of knowledge about the ancient druids, mostly gleaned from the Greeks and Romans.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of these folks having their imaginations captured by what they knew (or thought they knew) about the druids of old, a funny thing happened. Inspired by shreds of knowledge about ancient druids, filling in the gaps with a lot of Neoplatonism, and putting on funny robes and waving their arms around as they walked around stone circles, these fellows came up with a religion that filled an unmet spiritual need - a way to reach the divine through nature. In the 18th century, many of the trends of modernism were picking up speed: folks were moving to cities, the first glimmerings of the industrial revolution were being seen, and traditional ways were being questioned or even scrapped. When it came to religion, English society was offering two choices: formal, dogmatic Christianity on the one hand, or atheistic materialism on the other. The Druid Revival was made by those odd fellows who looked at that choice and said "no thanks, I'll roll my own." Neither of the major choices available had much room for Nature as a primary touchpoint with the divine. Neither option offered much in the way of working things out for yourself and holding beliefs that went against its accepted dogma. Neither worldview had much room for quirky weirdos who want to put on funny robes and welcome the dawn with a song. Druidry did.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us back to Iolo. True, his philosophy was more likely his own work than a tradition handed down from the middle ages. Also true, he wrote the poems that evoked that philosophy in symbols and gave it its aesthetic appeal. And yes, unluckily also true, he lied about these things. But let me ask you a question I have borrowed from Greer: what, precisely, is it about a charismatic, gifted poet, sharing the inspiration he gained from divine sources in verse, with a storyteller's flair for the dramatically True over the literally factual that is <i>not</i> quintessentially Celtic? How much more druidical can a man get? What's more, for the past nearly 300 years, those folks who read his (forged) works, meditate on the philosophy found therein, and try to live by the insights found by doing so find wisdom, comfort, and spiritual fulfillment. In other words, for as long as they were presented as the preserved teachings of the ancient druids, they were not at all authentic. Now that we can approach them as the work of a talented and likely inspired man of the 18th century, they can become authentic. But all along they have been <i>valid</i> - very many folks who seek along that path find something of what they're looking for.

A kidding header aside, if what I've shared about Druidry has at all sparked your interest, I've shared many possible starting points above. Most of them have <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/">John Michael Greer</a> in common. I have not yet earned the right to refer to him as a "teacher" of mine, as I haven't worked all the way through one of his books, which is the standard he says he finds acceptable there, but my spiritual path has obviously been greatly shaped by him. He has another book that just came out, meant for total beginners called <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-druid-path-a-modern-tradition-of-nature-spirituality-volume-11-john-michael-greer/17005131?ean=9781454943563">The Druid Path</a>. I haven't checked it out yet, since I'm plodding along with his older books. You could also do worse than to just start reading his blog and/or less formal <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org">journal</a>, at which he hosts a weekly "Ask Me Anything About Occultism," called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/tag/magic+monday">Magic Monday</a> for reasons I hope I don't have to spell out, which is a great way to jump into the deep end. There are a variety of Druid organizations available as well: I've mentioned the <a href="https://aoda.org">The Ancient Order of Druids in America</a> already. Greer has stepped down as their Grand Archdruid, but they're still very much around and have a lot of resources online (spoiler alert: many of them were written by Greer). I've heard from some folks that at least parts of the organization have perhaps become caught up in the political turmoil of our times, so if that's a concern for you, consider yourself forewarned. Another organization which has been around for a long time, but about which I know even less, is <a href="https://druidry.org/">The Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids</a>. Lastly of course, though I'm far from an expert, being only two years into this journey, you can of course ask me any questions you have.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not interested in learning any more about Druidry, I hope you will at least take a moment and appreciate that our world has space in it for a bunch of weirdos to draw inspiration from the well of the past, channel it into something that speaks to the deepest yearnings of those who cannot find what they're looking for in the mainstream, and water a tree of belief that has grown slowly but steadily, with many unalike branches. I don't know about you, but that gives me great hope that we just might be alright.

<i>A Quick Mark: I'm spending the holiday weekend with my kin, and I didn't knock out the editing ahead of time as I meant to. As such, I've put up the post to make it for the week, but I may make some fairly big changes over the next few days.</i>
</p>

<p>
One of the things I've been working on with this blog is to put more work into getting writing posted than to carefully laying everything out from first steps. For one, that has helped me stick to getting a post out every week, and for another, I kind of didn't think anyone else would read this. At this point, though, I've written a fair amount of posts that take as given some things about what I believe that I haven't spelled out anywhere, and I thought it would be helpful to have one post to send folks to when I write more posts about <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">small details in myths</a> or <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#last_hail_idun">prayers to Germanish Gods and Goddesses</a>.
</p>

<p>
This post is also an experiment in telling more of a personal story. Most of the time I like writing about thoughts and books and beliefs and such, but maybe opening up a bit will help ground where that stuff is coming from. Or maybe this is self-indulgent - let me know what you think.
</p>

<p>
One more thing before we get to it. This post is about my religious beliefs, but I'm not trying to sell you on anything. If you find anything here helpful, or if it echos your own experience, I'd love to hear from you and talk shop, but I'm not trying to <i>push</i> anything on you. My spiritual path so far has taught me that belief is <i>deeply</i> personal, <i>hugely</i> varied, and <i>often</i> weird, so I don't expect what has worked for me to be what you need.  That being said, let's take a look at where that path has taken me so far.
</p>

As a kid, my folks took me and my sister to a United Methodist church most every week. I don't remember if we went <i>every</i> Sunday, but it was close enough, along with Sunday School. Mostly I remember doing arts and crafts about Biblical stories, and church was just one of those boring things my folks took me along to, like when my dad went to look at home theater equipment or my mom and sister went clothes shopping. But at least sometimes there were donuts.
</p>

<p>
The first somewhat serious engagement with Christianity I remember was thanks to a summer camp I attended twice. I had a friend come back from a camp called Sky Ranch and tell me how awesome it was - water slides, horseback riding, even a "Blob" like in the movie Heavyweights (to be fair - when I saw Heavyweights, I was like "just like at Sky Ranch!"). I begged my parents to let me go and they reluctantly agreed, since at age eight, this would be my first sleepaway camp. I didn't know it was a Bible camp until I got there and every meal had the teen counselors singing psalms set to guitar. Also, we talked about Biblical stories after meals and said prayers before bed. Still, I was more drawn to the zipline and the rodeo at the end of the week, but some of those psalm-songs were pretty cool, and when I went back the next year, I took a bit more interest in the Bible study sessions, but still, it was mostly about the summer camp stuff.
</p>

<p>
Not too much later, my dad's work moved us, and when we got there, we just never found a church. It was thanks to a few things: my grandmother moved in with us, my dad's job got busier, and frankly, Christianity was not all that central to our family. Looking back, I bet my folks thought that taking your kids to church was something you were supposed to do if you didn't want them to turn out screwed up.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, the next time I bumped up against religion with any seriousness was when a friend of mine from back in Dallas was in town. He's about 6 years older than me, and I had always looked up to him as "the cool older kid." To be fair, he never blew off the hero-worshipping little kid down the alley. When I saw him in Virginia, he had gone to college, and I was in junior high, and I found out he had gotten pretty deeply into Christianity, which was a bit of a shocker. See, this is the guy who introduced me to Magic: the Gathering. He was a nerdy, smart guy into the nerdiest sorts of gaming. The other gamers I hung out with and looked up to were all some flavor of skeptical or hostile to traditional religion. My friend showed me a model of a smart person who nevertheless believed, and that made an impression on me.

<p>
Well, not too long after that, as you might not be shocked to hear, there was a girl. My first girlfriend was a Wiccan - not just adolescent rebellion, since her mom and stepdad were Wiccans, but it was still a bit shocking/weird back then. She loaned me some of the books, which spoke to my fantasy-loving heart, but I didn't get that much into them. As teenagers are wont to do, I copped some poses about the crushing weight of Christianity, but never really went anywhere past that.
</p>

<p>
We moved again, and as you might expect for a couple of 15 year olds, our vows of undying long-distance love didn't last all that long. For the rest of high school, religion wasn't that big of a deal for me. My new girlfriend had a similar bland, respectable Methodist background. One of my friends was the son of a Methodist preacher and himself a youth pastor, but mostly we quizzed each other on obscure Tolkien trivia. I had set aside the Wiccan stuff and fallen back on "Christian, I guess", if not just vaguely agnostic. It wasn't that big a deal in my life, but I didn't truly ask much about it.

My freshman year of college, I became friends with a senior. We hit it off immediately, found that we had rather a lot in common, and we're still good friends eighteen years later despite his career taking him all over Asia with visits home to the states, few, far between, and mostly dedicated to family. This friend was my second example of someone intelligent, nerdy, and thoughtful who took Christianity seriously. He organized a Religious Studies reading group that I participated in, and I joined him in laughing at some of the excesses of the Neopagan scene described in <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>, debating some of the metaphysical shortcomings of hardcore dualism, but most importantly for my own development, engaging seriously with C.S. Lewis's arguments in <i>Mere Christianity</i>. Here was a rationale for Christianity that was even stronger than the two positive models in my own life: an atheist who had come by it the hard way, intelligent, thoughtful, extremely knowledgeable, and making arguments that were <i>not</i> some variation of "because this infallible book says so". I found it very compelling and launched into a briefly strong interest and belief in Christianity that slowly faded into something I consciously believed, but did not have much bearing on my day to day life.
</p>

<p>
During my time in the Army, religion didn't play much of a role in my life (oddly enough, it tended to pop up at times like right before jumping out of an airplane - "no atheists in foxholes" and all that). I wore a medallion of St. Michael the Archangel that some organization gave me (he's the patron saint of paratroopers - he descends from the sky and kicks ass, you see), but it was mostly a good luck charm and not much more.

<p>
From there, I got out and went to business school and then started working as a management consultant. Somewhere amidst the travel, the attempts to analyze and optimize everything, and struggling to work out whether what I was doing "actually meant anything, really" my belief in anything transcendent collapsed. I became more and more attracted to hardcore rationalists who were unapologetically scientific materialists (to borrow a jokey distinction from Neal Stephenson, not meaning that they were really into BMWs and fancy watches, but that they believe that the material world of the senses is the only one there is). For a time, this was exhilirating and liberating: if I'm not constrained by some arbitrary rules handed down from iron age tribesmen and the Hellenistic prophet who made a few changes, then morality, meaning, purpose, they can all be whatever I want, right?
</p>

<p>
Obviously I was retreading the same ground that Nietzche, the existentialists, and others had attempted, and you might not be too surprised to learn that it ended up leading to aimlessness and depression. That approach was also just <i>terrible</i> at dealing with some of the actually bad shit that came down the road, like my healthy, non-smoking mom being diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer and my wife suffering a miscarriage. So, I had been convinced that this world and life was all there was, but trying to work out belief and meaning from scratch wasn't going so hot.

<p>
For dramatic purposes, I've held off introducing some influences that I really encountered earlier, but this is where they truly became significant. I began to take far more seriously Jung's contention that mythology contained deep psychological truth and meaning encoded in symbols and "beings". I thought something like "well, 'gods' may not actually be magical dudes and ladies floating out there in the sky or an alternate dimension, but they might actually be useful, nuanced personifications of inter-related concepts, impressions, and feelings, and religious ritual might be an empirically-proven technique for interacting with these aspects of the subconscious". <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html">This essay</a> by the old-school hacker and polymath Eric S. Raymond is a pretty good explanation of the concept, and might be the first place I encountered the idea. It will also come as no surprise that this led me to find rather a lot of value in Jordan Peterson's material (at least, if you've engaged with him at any level beyond "is this guy the devil?"). His work really helped me get a more intuitive grasp of the archetypes and how to recognize them in stories and mythologies, along with what they're doing in our subconscious (for example, using archetypal analysis helped me figure out some of the weirder ends of my sexual fantasizing over the years. No I won't tell you what it was).
</p>

<p>
As you might have guessed from my interest in fantasy fiction and games, I've always been fascinated by mythology. I first encountered the idea that myths could encode sophisticated understandings of the world in a chapter of Stephenson's <i>Cryptonomicon</i> where a character explains how the story of the conception of Erechtheus actually says a lot about the nature of money. I've since come to figure out that that whole section was a rehashing of Jung, but hey, it succeeded in making the point very clear. Through much of the time I considered myself a Christian, I would say things like "if I got to pick what I believed, I'd believe in the Norse Gods. Valhalla sounds like a pretty rad afterlife." Now I was in the position of actually believing that I <i>could</i> choose what to believe, since I figured that any system of practice reasonably grounded in what we knew about actual ancient polytheist religion would work as an interface with my subconscious. So I started saying prayers to the Norse Gods. Again, I basically believed I was talking to subconscious processes put in place by evolution, but I also believed that might turn out to be useful.
</p>

<p>
Well, for a while I kept going through the motions, waiting for the results I expected. While an intellectual understanding of the archetypes was proving very useful in extracting significance from literature and mythology, my prayers and rituals (practiced alone, and though with regularity, not particular energy) were not really doing much for me. So, when my mom died and we had our first daughter not long after, I tried to keep up with these practices for a while, but they fell by the wayside, which was okay, because I was fine. I had whiskey.
</p>

<p>
According to my wife and family, I was not fine. Sure, I was mostly keeping up with my job and being a new dad, but I didn't seem myself, and I didn't seem okay. I responded as many folks do: no, you're wrong, I am okay, and I'm going to go back to my whiskey. I eventually agreed to see a therapist, mostly to placate my wife, and that has been helpful, but didn't have as much to do with my spiritual development as some other things (if your friends or family tell you they think you should talk to a therapist, consider giving it a try - you don't have to go back if you don't like it!)

<p>
Not to put too fine a point on it, but the "other things" were drugs. Likely not exactly how you think, though. A few months after my first daughter was born, I went to a friend's bachelor party. While there, I tried LSD for the first time. I had been reading and listening a lot about psychedelics and their potential for psychological growth and healing, and I wasn't especially interested in it as a "party drug", so I was a bit surprised that my first encounter was pretty much that. Part of what convinced me was that the fellow who brought it is knowledgeable, careful, interested in the spiritual/psychological uses of the drug, and a medical professional to boot. So I started out with a half dose, didn't feel much of anything and took another half dose, and ended up having a pleasant, but fairly minor experience, with some bendy wood grain and my face looking odd in the mirror, followed by a complete inability to sleep.
</p>

<p>
What the hell does that have to do with my spiritual development? Well, not much. If anything, I was a bit disillusioned with the transformative promise I had built up in my mind for psychedelics. But it was enjoyable and I hadn't experienced anything remotely approaching the negatives people warn about, so when a few months later some friends of mine invited me to take some mushrooms on a camping trip, I said "that sounds great". This time, I was more comfortable with taking a bigger dose, we were in beautiful natural surroundings, and I was entirely with some of my closest friends, rather than a mixed group of folks I know well and not so well. Well, again, no ground-shaking insights, but I had an <i>extremely</i> pleasant afternoon where I enjoyed the sights, sounds, and feelings of a cold stream on a hot afternoon in the woods with my friends. I did have a small insight, as I was "coming down", though. For those of you who have never experienced it, one of the weirder things about psychedelics (apparently mushrooms even more than LSD) is that as they start to wear off, it comes in waves - you feel euphoric and things are moving that you know aren't really moving, and then a moment later everything is normal, and you think "oh, okay, I guess that was a fun ride that's over, now", but then you start noticing some weird stuff again. They're like waves that gradually reduce and go back out to sea. Well, this effect was far more noticeable than on my prior trip, and so I found myself wondering "how will I <i>really</i> know when it's over for good?" Oh, I should have mentioned - these drugs also reeeaaallly mess with your sense of time. But in the midst of "is this it? Whoah, guess not. Wait, is this it <i>now</i>?" I came to the realization that it didn't really matter when it ended, because the value of the experience had been independent of its finitude. A concept I had encountered plenty of times in Taoist and Buddhist philosophy, but not one that I had really "grokked" without some chemical help.
</p>

<p>
Okay, okay, I know, that starts to hint at something vaguely spiritual, but it doesn't really have to do with religion, does it? I had to lay out the first two experiences for the third (and so far, last) to make sense as a crucial step in my journey. As I mentioned, I had had some hopes about psychedelics before trying them, and so far, my experiences had veered far more to "a good time with my friends" than "mind-expanding insight that shakes your beliefs to their core". So when the next opportunity presented itself at another campout, I pursued the straightforward strategy of <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/">"more dakka"</a>. I took a medium size dose of mushrooms, and an hour or two into that, I took a dose of LSD, and within an hour of that, I took another. Well, much of the experience was as before: me discoursing at greater than necessary length on the military history of the Roman empire, giggling uncontrollably at fart jokes, staring transfixedly at natural beauty. At some point, though, I laid down and looked up at the stars, and as they began to dance and swirl and resolve themselves into crystalline patterns, three major things happened: 1. I felt overwhelming, but ultimately positive, grief about my mother, 2. I had an insight about thinking versus feeling, and 3. for a moment, I lost my usual sense of "self" without being unconscious.
</p>

<p>
Point number 2 was largely brought about by point number 1, and is the main one I want to focus on here, though point 3 might have some interesting implications to dive into at some point. My whole life I've been a "smart guy" - I started talking early, I read above my age level, I got put in gifted and talented classes as soon they were an option, and so on and so forth. Most of the problems in my life had been the kind that smarts make easier: once you understand <i>how</i> something works, you can often "skip to the end" without doing the intermediate steps. If someone is trying to illuminate a concept through examples and the first two make it clear, you don't need the next five. If I can toot my own horn, I'm especially good at this kind of inferential thinking, so I've sought out situations in life where I can excel by being good at it. Well, the powerful grief I felt for my mom on this trip made me realize that this was a trick I had learned to over-apply throughout my life. I thought that because I "understood" my grief, I was done. I could skip right to the end of moving on, with occasional sadness. That realization made me realize I do this <i>all the time</i> - "oh, I understand that working out is important for being happy and healthy, that's the same as actually doing it everyday, right?" That's an intentionally ridiculous example when put explicitly, but some part of me more or less thinks this about <i>anything</i> where the experience, the <i>doing</i> of it is more important than understanding it in principle.

Okay, so thank you for bearing with me for that brief foray into psychedelic "trip reports", which are <i>always</i> less compelling to literally everyone else than the one who experienced them. Back to your regularly-scheduled examination of intellectual influences. So, here I was doing better psychologically and personally - I wasn't drinking so much anymore, I was doing even better as a dad, taking care of more things around the house, seeming more myself, all that good stuff. So I wasn't any more interested in spiritual topics like philosophy, mythology, religion, and so forth than I always had been when I read a book called <i>World Full of Gods</i> by John Michael Greer.
</p>

<p>
My best friend from the Army introduced me to Greer a few years back, and <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/">some of his writings</a> had been interesting and useful to me from the standpoint of approaching religion as an exercise in archetypes, which at this point in our narrative, was still what I believed, but I wasn't very actively practicing. <i>World Full of Gods</i> sets out to make a case for polytheism, and to greatly boil down a well-written and argued book, it rests on two main arguments against atheism: 1. most atheist arguments against religion are hopelessly tangled up in its history of arguing against culturally dominant monotheism (mostly Christianity, with a side helping of Islam in more recent years), 2. the scientific materialist worldview underlying most atheism rests on a key premise that is not self-evident. I found 1. interesting, but less important, as I was already largely comfortable with the idea that "religion" need not necessarily mean "Christianity" and most of the arguments that had brought me along to atheism had relied less on "the argument from evil" ("how could an ominibenevolent, omnipotent, omniscient God allow evil to exist in the world?") and more on "things that don't cash out to verifiable predictions about the material world aren't falsifiable and so can't be usefully reasoned about".
</p>

<p>
It was the second argument that got me thinking. Greer argues that the worldview of scientific materialism is based on a fairly simple premise: the only things that count as "real" are those things sensed by the five senses. This sounds pretty uncontroversial at first glance, especially in our modern society, where the scientific materialist worldview is so much the default. Notice a few things that are left out, though: imagination. The experience of feeling something. Thoughts. Now, sure, you can arrive at approximations of these things that are sensible to the five senses: I can think words in my thoughts and then type them into my laptop, put them somewhere that you can see them with your eyeballs, and if you and someone else read this, you can both be pretty confident that I thought these words, and since words and letters have a pretty tight correlation, that's likely pretty good. But what about less clear cut cases? If I describe to you (to borrow another image from Stephenson, this time from <i>Anathem</i>) a "purple nerve-gas farting dragon", it seems rather likely that an image pops into your head of what this creature might look like. Does it look the same as the one I'm imagining? Much harder to say. Maybe if you and I are both accomplished artists, we might draw what we see in our minds eye and compare those drawings, but that wouldn't capture the emotional associations you have with the image (funny? scary? a blend?). Even if we hooked both of us up to the most advanced neuroscanners ever invented and had both of us imagine the dragon, the sameness or differentness of the shapes or lines on the screen wouldn't tell you what it was <i>like</i> to imagine the dragon.
</p>

<p>
Okay, I've treated the argument fairly briefly here, and maybe not to your satisfaction, but basically as Greer presented it was enough for me to go "huh, okay, some parts of human experience that seem wildly important and self-evident aren't actually adequately grounded out in what is traditionally considered falsifiable." You may or may not be with me on this point, but for now, we'll proceed with the narrative as if <i>I</i> found it convincing at the time, because I did (and still do). Greer then points out that almost every human culture for all of human history has had experiences in this non-sensory realm (or at least, partially in this realm) that they regard as self-evident and obviously real, and these experiences are of various beings that have various levels of personhood, power, and knowledge, and may or may not be tied to material things like trees, rocks, animals, and so forth. Basically, it boils down to this: the claim that religious experiences are "just in your head" ignores the crucial importance of "just". It is weighted with tremendous metaphysical load - if something happens in your imagination it is not "really real".
</p>

<h3 id="org5c10d77">Then I Saw Her Face, Now I'm a Believer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c10d77">
<p>
So, I now had a profound personal insight I am bad at things that are not intellectually, linguistically describable, and an intellectual argument that this blind spot might be exactly where religious experience happens to live. I decided to conduct an experiment: I would resume prayer and religious ritual, along with a new practice called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/tag/discursive+meditation">"discursive meditation"</a>, and as far as I was able, I would try to believe the Gods to whom I was praying and about whom I was thinking were "really real" even if my only experience of them would be "in my head", and I'd see how it went for a while. The short answer is that about two weeks after starting this experiment, I had a profoundly strong religious experience of being visited by a Goddess and briefly hosting a God. It was amazing, wonderful, and utterly recognizable to anyone who has read about religious experiences. It was at once one of the most singular experiences I've had and also completely mundane to most humans for most of human history.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-hold-on-to-what-you-believe">
<p>
Okay, so if you wanted to pin me down, what do I truly <i>believe</i> now, today, as of this writing? Well, first and most importantly, I believe that what you <i>do</i> is far weightier than what you <i>believe</i>. By which I mean that I don't put a lot of weight on what thoughts you (or I) hold in your (or my) head about how Life, the Universe, and Everything tick. Letting myself be open to the ontological reality of non-physical consciousnesses outside of my body might have been a necessary step to getting where I am, or it might not have been. Sitting my ass down and bethinking on the myths was <i>definitely</i> needed to get me where I am. So while I am going to try to give as short a run down of what I believe as I can, I want to put the warning ahead of it that it is subject to change and far less important to me than keeping up with prayer, ritual, meditation, and divination.
</p>

<p>
That first point stems from the next biggest chunk of my belief, which I've also gotten mostly from Greer: the cosmos is way bigger and way weirder than our social primate brains can ever hope to understand with any great fidelity. Even the bare fact of how <i>big</i> all the stuff outside of the Earth is, how <i>truly</i> far away it is, is <i>literally</i> unthinkable - we can't know it, the best we can do is approximate. So if physical reality is that hard to understand, the spiritual realities that underlie and go beyond it must be even more unfathomable. Once again, the best we can do is get the rough shape of it.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of "getting the rough shape of it," despite the inadequacy of our current state of development for <i>truly</i> understanding Being, I also think that we <i>can</i> get glimpses of what's going on under the hood of material reality through a variety of spiritual practices. I think that every long-lasting spiritual tradition has had some insight into the eternal truths of the universe, but nothing so simplistic as "all religions are basically the same." Instead, since all of Being (including its spiritual elements) is big, weird, and complex, I think that different spiritual traditions get glimpses of different bits of the unfathomably complex big picture. Think the wise men and the elephant, and that's pretty close.
</p>

<p>
For my own practice, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/">gnosis is far weightier than episteme</a> - as I said above, I can't truly ground my religious experiences, including the first big one, in any kind of "proof" that would mean anything to anyone else, or even to myself, intellectually. I have to rely on the experience itself. If I've had a meaningful experience that makes me and my life better, well, what else do I truly need to know about it? The flip side of this, of course, is that these experiences have been <i>mine</i>, and I don't presume to put them on anyone else. By the same token, if other folks have their own, wildly different, spiritual beliefs/practices/experiences, who am I to tell them how to think/feel about those?
</p>

<p>
Okay, okay, I hear you asking "yeah, but what do you <i>believe</i>?" Again, with the caveats above in mind, let me try to do the best I can. I think that all of the cosmos is a manifestation of something divine, and that consciousness is in some sense primary to matter. I think all consciousness is a part of that fundamental divine, but it is importantly differentiated. Something like how Niagra Falls, Lake Erie, the Niagra River, and Lake Ontario are all a part of the same system of water, but each has its own differentiated reality. I think some of these differentiated manifestations of consciousness sometimes embody themselves here in the material plane as sundry beings, and that some manifestations of consciousness don't need material bodies. The former would be "lifeforms" and the latter would be "Gods, spirits, and so forth."
</p>

<p>
I find <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-occult-philosophy-workbook-a-one-year-course-in-the-secret-wisdom-john-michael-greer/18532301?ean=9781801520119">old school occult philosophy</a> a helpful way of making sense of the world if you accept the reality of non-physical things and of certain weird phenomena that folks have been saying happened to them for hundreds, or even thousands of years, but that the modern materialist worldview says are just plain wrong (see ghosts, for one). This provides a framework for making sense of some of the above. Gods, Goddesses, spirits, and so forth are beings that exist on non-material planes and mostly interact with us through our presence on non-material planes. Maybe the most important of these for religious practice is the astral plane - the realm of imagination, desire, and visualization. The short version is that I think Gods, Goddesses, and Spirits mostly take up shapes/sounds/emotional impressions on the astral plane as a way to interact with us on a level we can all access. Do Gods sometimes take on material forms? Maybe, I've never met one! But I find the idea of astral imagery and it sometimes being "inhabited" a useful one.
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. Do me a favor and picture a burly, red-haired, thick-bearded man with a big heart. He loves his wife and his kids, he has a great thirst for ale and hunger for meat, and his temper is a bit short. He's good at fighting, and mostly he's not angry about it, he finds it joyful. But his wrath is terrible when awakened, even if it passes quickly. As you might suspect if you've been reading me for any amount of time, I just described (some of) how Thunor/Thor is usually imagined. Now, if I say "picture this feisty red-haired warrior smashing some trolls with his hammer," you likely don't have a very strong religious response - you don't feel the presence of the divine/numinous, even though you can clearly see in your mind's eye Thunor smashing some trolls. Certain occult traditions would call this mental image an "astral vehicle," and as this example likely makes clear, it's at least somewhat generated individually - I may have described some features to you, which means I shaped the image, but you did the actual imagining, and if we could somehow print out your mental picture and mine, they would almost certainly differ, even though a third person might look at them and think "they were going for the same guy." Well, I think that when you pray, do rituals, or otherwise seriously engage with religious practice, you bring your own imaginings, likely informed by a tradition of what to imagine, to the table, but then to the degree it is a true religious experience, someone else breaths life into that imagining. So if I just ask you to imagine Thunor with the above characteristics smashing trolls, likely nobody's home but your own imagination. On the other hand, if you earnestly pray to Thunor, light a candle, give a drink offering, and quiet your mind waiting for a response, when a mental image pops up of Thunor giving you some advice, that might be your imagined image ("astral vehicle") being animated by an actual outside-of-you non-physical consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Since I believe in benevolent non-physical consciousnesses, I have to admit to the possibility of malevolent ones too, and everything in between. While I think there are very powerful non-physical beings on our side (Gods, angels, spirits and such), I also think there are a lot of more middling ones that surpass us in some ways and are less than us in others who are more ambiguous, and then there must be some very bad beings that again, surpass us in some ways, but are less than us in others. The word you may be stopping yourself from thinking for this last group is "demon." I don't know that I've ever met a full-on demon, but it seems naive to suppose that every serious religious tradition on the planet is just wrong that there are some non-physical beings out there who are bad news and best avoided.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, the benevolent non-physical beings that I feel the greatest kinship to are the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, most of all as seen through an Anglo-Saxon lens. I can't really explain this, except that they speak to me aesthetically, and I've come to believe that that's an under-appreciated aspect of religious feeling: what do you find beautiful/gripping/moving? I've come to have great respect for the Jewish and Christian religions, their teachings, and ceremonies, but imaginatively they leave me cold. I think that's a reasonably good sign they're not for me - at least not right here and right now. But that in no way means I think they're invalid for everyone (see above about <i>gnosis</i>) - if anything, I'm far <i>more</i> sympathetic to religious Christians, Jews, and Muslims (and every other major religion) than I was when I was a materialist.
</p>

<p>
I also suspect that reincarnation is a big part of how the world works. I don't have any past-life memories or anything, but thinkers and writers I respect say they do, and spiritual traditions that include reincarnation have proven worthwhile to me, and there are a <i>lot</i> of traditions that feature reincarnation. I was <i>shocked</i> when I finally got around to reading Plato's <i>Republic</i> last year to find near the end a detailed description of reincarnation. Somehow, the fact that literally the <i>most famous work in all of western philosophy</i> talked in depth about reincarnation was unknown to me - not only an educated person, not only a liberal arts major, but a <i>Classics</i> major - I studied Greek and Latin history, culture, and literature! Obviously I did a crap job if I got through college without reading <i>Republic</i>, but still, I hadn't even <i>heard</i> of the <a href="https://www.philosophybro.com/archive/platos-the-myth-of-er-a-summary">"Myth of Er"</a>. Once I did read it, though, I was like "holy shit, how did I have no idea that the West's most famous work of philosophy talks about reincarnation? It must just be me." And so I went online to see what scholars thought. And you know what I found? A bunch of folks trying to work out what Plato/Socrates meant allegorically, metaphorically, and so forth (that link above continues in this vein). Basically <i>no one</i> took seriously the idea that Plato/Socrates was trying to relate something about how the world actually works. So anyway, I don't have strong evidence for reincarnation or anything, but once you start poking around, the belief in it is <i>way</i> more widespread than you might think if you've grown up with an American protestant worldview.
</p>

<p>
So, what falls out of all of the above? I believe that there is more to me and to you than our bodies. We have an everlasting soul that was around before we were born and will be around after we die. Other non-bodily Beings are trying to either help or hurt these souls on our way. Those souls come down in the material world to learn its lessons life after life, and all of us will eventually learn every lesson we need, moving on to some new way of being. There are some practices, like religion, magic, and so forth, that can help you learn some of those lessons faster and less painfully. Pretty much all religious folks are onto at least a portion of this, but none of us have the whole picture - as such it pays to be open-minded and welcoming to religious folks, but also not to be too shaken by meeting folks who practices are very different from your own.
</p>

<p>
Part of why I've gone into all of this is because these days, most folks either have no religious belief at all or very superficial beliefs. There are very clearly a lot of problems that stem from that, and some folks look at those problems and conclude that the way forward can only be a return to traditional (meaning Christian, at least in America) beliefs. Since those traditional beliefs don't especially resonate with me, I've wanted to share that there are at least a handful of weirdos with strong, sincere religious beliefs that might have more in common with traditional beliefs than most old school Christians would initially grant. I like having the freedom to practice my own <i>very</i> idiosyncratic religious pursuits rather than having that baby tossed out with the bathwater of materialist agnosticism and atheism. In other words, theists of all stripes: I am your friend! There's a bunch of weird stuff out there, and while some of it is very bad, not all of it is.

<p>
Since then I've kept up the prayer, ritual, and meditation, and it has continued to be hugely beneficial to me. I don't feel like I have all the answers, far from it, but I do feel like there's <i>something</i> meaningful and worthwhile beyond myself and my day-to-day concerns. So I consider myself a believing polytheist these days, which would have been pretty shocking to me even a couple of years ago. The experience of things so flatly denied by the worldview I held then has been rather a shake-up: I have to rethink my views on rather a wide range of topics, since my nuts-and-bolts ideas about what's "really real" have taken a substantial adjustment.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I'm also left with the lingering doubts you might expect. Hell, that you might be feeling as more forcefully than "doubts" right at the moment: isn't it more plausible this is some kind of wish fulfillment? Just because it's common throughout history and across cultures doesn't mean it's accurate - it could just mean our brains are all fundamentally flawed the same way. Even if you're convinced of something religious, isn't polytheism primitive or unsophisticated? If you start taking unverifiable thoughts too seriously, isn't that called being crazy?
</p>

<p>
To all of which I can only respond that some part of me acknowledges the possibility of any of those being true. The <i>whole reason</i> scientific materialism grounds out in the five senses and is suspicious of what can't be verified by them is because you can arrive at much more definite, easier-to-agree-upon conclusions. And the stuff that you can figure out with those more definite conclusions is pretty damn impressive. See: twentieth century physics. It's a useful way of thinking that has done a lot of good for the world, and I'm by no means saying that anyone should abandon the methods or hard-won insights of such careful thinking. What I am saying is that since I have allowed myself to take more seriously those parts of my experience that are not fully describable/verifiable by such thinking, I have been happier and more fulfilled, with a greater sense of meaning than I've ever experienced before. So, if it is a delusion, it's an awfully useful one.
</p>

<p>
I'll leave you with the ancient wisdom of otherworldly gurus, wise sages, and elder hackers alike: YMMV.

Ever since I read this <a href="https://terminalvelocity-rpg.blogspot.com/2021/11/freight-rates-and-what-they-mean-for.html">post</a> about what the cost of freight says about your
sci-fi setting, I've been thinking about what it means for the real world. If
you don't care about sci-fi world building, don't worry, that's not where I'm
going with this, but here's what the post does: it spells out what the world
would be like with cheaper or costlier shipping . If you have very cheap
freight, you move all kinds of things between worlds. If freight is dear,
though, you only ship the fanciest things - if you're gonna bring food, it might
as well be steak and lobster. Interesting enough if you're a writer or building
an RPG setting, but what does that have to do with the this world right here?
Well, it seems to me that when folks talk about the industrial revolution, they
always talk about <i>production</i> and almost not at all about <i>distribution</i>. This
might be a mistake - I'm starting to think that cheaper shipping has had at
least as much to do with making the industrial world as mass production. Maybe
somebody else has already done this to death, so if you happen to know of any
books that talk about this, kindly let me know, as I'd love to read them.
</p>

<p>
This is a big, hairy topic, and one I'm likely to come back to, but I wanted to
think out loud a bit and see if that gets me anywhere. First off, let me lay out
an important premise underlying what follows: whatever else the industrial
revolution has been, it is <i>mostly</i> the story of energy becoming <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">insanely cheap</a>
(Tim Urban is rather more sanguine on future energy than I am, but he does a
good breakdown on the history). For most of human history, the most energy we
could harness was putting a mill near a waterfall, but over the course of the
19th and 20th century, we found fossil fuels and worked out how to burn them to
make stuff happen, and we're still burning them like crazy.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so I bring up energy and the industrial revolution - what's the first
thing that comes to mind? Factories, right? True, steam power, and later
electricity, allowed for cranking out a lot of stuff with a lot less human
input. Undoubtedly, this is a big part of the story, but I think we all know it
pretty well. What we think about less is how did all of this factory-made stuff
get to where it was going?
</p>

<p>
Let's do a little thought experiment. Imagine you live in a town ringed by
impassable mountains. Everything the folks of the town need gets made here, all
business stays within these mountains. If you were to build a factory that can
make 100 widgets for every one the storied widget master craftsman can turn out,
who is going to buy them? Now imagine a pass gets blasted and there are dozens
of towns now within a day's ride. All of a sudden, the factory seems like a
better deal, right? This is basic supply and demand stuff, but the heart of the
idea is that productive capacity is only as useful as the size of the market
that can/will buy what it makes.
</p>

<p>
You can likely see where I'm going with this. With steam ships, rail, and later
trucking, the whole world became the market for things made anywhere. Economies
of scale do more for you when you can sell to such a large market. It used to be
that most folks could afford to have all of their furniture hand made out of
real wood - since every village had a woodworker. Nowadays, mass production plus
long-distance shipping means one factory in China can spit out furniture for
millions of people. Thanks to fossil fuels, that's way cheaper than having some
dude down the street do it, so the only handmade furniture is super high-end
Amish stuff that you have to take out a second mortgage to buy.
</p>

<p>
Take pretty much any craft that used to be done in the neighborhood and cheap
shipping has wrecked it.
</p>

<p>
But it's not only about shipping <i>stuff</i>. As the writer of the sci-fi post points
out, above a given shipping price, you don't get space truckers, you get
astronauts: if mass is expensive, you want the chunks of mass you have to have
(read: the crew) to be as useful and worthwhile as can be. It turns out that
shipping workers, or at least their work, has all kinds of knock-on outcomes. I
first came across the bearing of transportation and communication on work in
<a href="https://www.drorpoleg.com/rise-of-the-10x-class/">this post</a> by Dror Poleg. As with Tim Urban, let's set aside where Poleg thinks
things are going and zoom in on some of the history he shares instead. Late in
the 1800s, some economists began to mark some changes to some jobs, but not
others. For one thing, most musicians and other performers began making less
money, but a handful started making <i>way</i> more - for the first time, there were
"stars". What had happened was that performers could now cheaply and quickly get
around the country. Those who were very good started drawing crowds wherever
they went. So, if you were the best singer in New York, now you could also be
the best singer in Philadelphia and Washington and so forth. Great news for the
star! But what about the best singer in Washington? Maybe she's not as good as
the New York one, so whenever New York comes down to sing, that lady is no
longer the best singer in Washington. Before trains, every town needed singers,
and all of them could do okay. But with trains, fewer singers could give a
bigger market what it wanted, and that heated up the competition between all
singers, with a few winners and lots of losers. And that was just from <i>trains</i>.
Once we got recordings and broadcast, that competition got taken to 11 - since
it became <i>even cheaper</i> to "ship" the "product."
</p>

<p>
For me, that story unlocked the thought that making it cheaper to reach a wider
market can lead to a lot of unforeseen outcomes. Once I found that lens, I have
found it helpful to look at all kinds of things with it.
</p>

<p>
For example, take suburbia. You can talk about all kinds of things that added to
the trend for a bunch of folks to start living in a way no one else has for all
of human history, but you can say one thing for sure: you can't have suburbs
without a cheap way to get into the city. Sure, some early suburbs came about
once trains became common, but it was the widespread adoption of cars that made
suburbia mushroom through such a wide swath of the US. As the performer example
above showed, though, it's not only moving the person doing the work, it's
moving the product as well - and these days, most knowledge work can be done
remotely, which is even cheaper than commuting. We know what knowledge work
looks like when the worker can't zoom into the city from miles away in a car or
Zoom into the meeting from his laptop - you get a bunch of scribes and clerks.
Read some Dickens to get the idea.
</p>

<p>
It's not just work, either.
</p>

<p>
It used to be that if you wanted to talk to folks, you had to go to the bar or
the Loyal Order of Water Buffalo lodge or wherever. These days, you can just get
out your laptop and hop on Discord or Slack. Not only do you have more folks you
can talk to, you can talk about <i>whatever</i> you want - you can get down into some
very weird, very tiny little niches and find folks that care about your weird
thing as much as you do instead of struggling through listening to your neighbor
talk about whatever dumb thing he cares about. As I hinted when I <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#cows_don_t_know_what_s_best_for_them">talked about
cows</a>, it might be that all of this unfettered choice has some downsides. Maybe
the <a href="https://www.alibris.com/Bowling-Alone-The-Collapse-and-Revival-of-American-Community-Robert-D-Putnam/book/783607?matches=146">dwindling of our sundry clubs, lodges, and groups</a> is not as much about the
weakening worth of our folk as it is that doing something else is just <i>too easy</i>.
</p>

<p>
I don't really know what could or should be done about some of the downsides of
cheap freight, most of all since it seems like the more I look at it, the more
things it touches. As I said above, this might all be well-trodden ground, so
maybe others have already come up with thoughts on how to handle all of this
(again, if so, kindly let me know). For now, this is more of a thread I'm
picking up on when I come across it than something I'm going to buckle down and
dig deep on - so, look for more thoughts on this, but I don't know when.

</p>

<p>
I've been letting my thoughts about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9ZPa4vleiU">authenticity</a> and how we should think about
it when it comes to belief simmer for a while now. I've gone from giving
authenticity nearly the top spot for working out what to believe and how to
worship to now giving it a much narrower job. I think a lot of us grapple with
authenticity in belief, but I've yet to see anyone go over it as thoroughly as I
might wish. Luckily, I read something the other day that helped untangle what
had been holding me back. To get there, though, let's lay some groundwork.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org247cce5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org247cce5">Authentic Things Come From Where They Say They Do</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org247cce5">
<p>
First off, what are we even talking about when I say "authenticity?" A lot of
folks have meant a lot of things by this word, so I'm going to borrow a way of
pinning it down from one of the works that has shaped my thinking, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/a-few-words-about-authenticity/">this post
from John Michael Greer</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Authenticity is a matter of whether something has the source it claims to have;
validity is a matter of whether it works.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See that word "validity?" Keep it in mind for later, as it's the supporting
actor to our star. For now, though, you can see this meaning of "authenticity"
rests on <i>where</i> did something come from, and a bit less so on whether the
wellspring from which it comes has the right to bestow the name it calls itself.
Here's a couple of somewhat silly examples: Greg Graffin starts a new band, and
it doesn't sound much like Bad Religion, but he says "this is punk rock." Most
folks would go "okay, yeah, I can hear that." On the other hand, some unknown 15
year old gets together four of his best friends, they learn to sing in lovely
harmony, and they put together some stunning dance moves that dazzle all the
girls in their high school, but since their oh-so-harmonized and
carefully-choreographed lyrics are about anarchy, they say that what they're
doing is "punk" - we might not be as likely to go along with that.
</p>

<p>
Or take something near and dear to my Texan heart: chili. If your Texan
grandmother learned how to make chili from her range cook daddy, even if she
does something most folks don't with chili, we're not gonna fight her when she
says "this is real chili." If a hip Paris chef dreams up a brand new spicy vegan
soup and calls it chili, we might feel a little otherwise.
</p>

<p>
What I'm getting at here is to build on Greer's meaning a bit: our high school
friends could say "we're punk because our friend Bill said we are," which might
be wholly true. Their punk brand comes from Bill, so they have the source they
say they do, but for us to work out whether we <i>buy</i> it, we have to know who Bill
is and what makes him a rightful giver of the much-sought mark of "punk."
</p>

<p>
Okay, so are we on the same leaf about what we mean by "authenticity" for
today's talk? Good. Now that we know what we're talking about, we get to an even
weightier asking: why do we care? Isn't it kinda open-and-shut that it's a good
thing for something to come from where it says it does, and for that somewhere
to be somehow rightful? As you may have gathered from the name of this post, I
<i>don't</i> think it's open-and-shut, but authenticity <i>can</i> be very helpful, so let's
take a moment to talk about what authenticity can do for us.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge0fdc23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge0fdc23">Folks Use Authenticity as a Shortcut for Validity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge0fdc23">
<p>
At its heart, authenticity is a rule of thumb for working out whether we can
<i>trust</i> someone or something - is he who he says he is? Did folks truly believe
this stuff back in the day? If a work tells you what to do or how to be, by what
right does it do so? Put bluntly, things that are not authentic are often <i>lying</i>
somehow. If a set of teachings doesn't truly come from where it says it does,
how do you know whether anything else in those teachings is true? If the
wellspring of a belief is somehow not rightful (legitimate), then maybe that
belief isn't either. And if a belief is new, how do we know what effects it will
have on those who adopt it in the long run? I've stated all these as problems
with the inauthentic, but lets put them positively for the authentic: ideally, a
tradition or set of beliefs that is authentic should come from where it says it
does, that source should have some claim to validity with regard to its
teachings, and ideally, the tradition holding these teachings going back to this
source should have been around for a good, long time to see how it responds to
the world as it actually is, rather than as its imagined.
</p>

<p>
This is all rather airy, so let's come down to ground a bit. Take Catholicism.
Catholicism says that it is the body of beliefs, practices, and teachings that
began with Jesus Christ, as built on by the Church for the last 2,000 years.
Now, as for the wellspring, of course some folks don't think there was a living,
breathing man named Jesus, much less that he was the son of God and God Himself
in the flesh. But we do know that at least that in the first hundred years CE, a
new set of beliefs and worship got started in Judea and began to spread around
the Roman Empire, and that all of today's Christians, including the Catholic
Church, can follow an a unbroken path back to that set of beliefs and worship.
How about rightfulness? Well, clearly not everyone acknowledges the rightfulness
of the Catholic Church to settle things about Godlore (exhibit A: Martin
Luther), but the Church <i>does</i> have a long-running and fairly readily grasped way
of working out who gets to say authoritative things about the Church,
understanding of holy writing, and changes to ways of doing things. And again,
there's a clear throughline for this way of doing things going back 2,000 years.
Therefore, most folks would have very little trouble acknowledging mainstream
Catholicism as an "authentic" set of beliefs. Even if you don't think they are
<i>right</i>, you also likely don't think they are <i>fake</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, let's take Scientology. The wellspring was a fairly, but by
no means wildly, well-known and well-liked mid-twentieth century science fiction
author who said that he gained insight into the make-up of Being while working
with folks through a kind of therapy he had worked up. Said author was heard by
friends and family talking about how religion was the way to make money.
Sometime later, after a bankruptcy, he shifted from calling his therapy a
scientific way to a spiritual one, and was hit with a handful of criminal
charges as his new church grew. Said church was officially incorporated as a
religious organization in 1953. The way the church works out who gets to make
settle what is religiously true, how those settlements get made, and even what
those settlements are is well-known for its murkiness and kept to a narrow group
of folks high up in the church. From all this, many folks (myself included) do
not see Scientology as all that authentic, whatever else it may or may not be.
I'll leave it up to you whether the rule of thumb "don't trust Scientology since
they seem not to be authentic" is worth following here, but I know where I land.
</p>

<p>
I want to talk more about <i>why</i> we are so keen to look at authenticity as if it
were validity, but first I want to talk a bit about some of the turns my own
spiritual path has taken thus far and what it has taught me about authenticity
and validity.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org199ed32" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org199ed32">But Authenticity Doesn't Wholly Get At Validity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org199ed32">
<p>
Okay, so we've laid out how authenticity can be a helpful shortcut for thinking
about some of the things we care about in weighing a religious or spiritual
belief. To get at why I think authenticity is not <i>enough</i> by itself, and
sometimes needs to give way to some other ways of judging a set of teachings,
though, I think it will be helpful to talk a bit about what I've done and where
authenticity has fit in with that.
</p>

<p>
As you may <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">remember</a>, not so long ago, I was a pretty won over by atheistic
materialist. If you pushed me, I'd say that I didn't know for sure, and there
wasn't really any way to do so, but it was smarter to start out needing to be
talked out of the thought that there was nothing but the material world, rather
than the other way around. Even though (because of?) this, I still found myself
drawn to myth, magic, and other spiritual things, most of all the weirder stuff.
Then, an <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/dancing.html">essay</a> by a thinker I had long looked up to, Eric S. Raymond, helped
bring together some fuzzy hunches I had into a way of looking at the world that
hung together. Namely, that religious or magical practices <i>might</i> do <i>something</i>,
whether or not the metaphysics behind the ritual were what they said they were.
For one materialist take on how magic might "work," even if not in the way or
for the reasons thought by those doing the magic, check out this <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/06/19/the-use-and-abuse-of-witchdoctors-for-life/">tale of
invulnerability potions against bullets in Africa</a>. Anyhow, I reckoned that if
magic was good enough for arch-materialist Raymond, it was good enough for me,
and so I had "permission" to check out magic and weirdo religion while keeping
my rational materialist way of seeing myself and the world.
</p>

<p>
So, the frame through which I looked at this stuff was something like this: 1.
almost all humans in all steads for all time have had some kind of
magical/religious ritual, 2. ritual seems to do <i>some</i> good things that you can't
get without it, and 3. ritual seems to reach the nethermind (subconscious) in
ways that don't always make sense to the speaking, wakeful (conscious) mind. In
this frame, it seemed straightforward that I needed a set of practices that 1.
spoke to me aesthetically, as that would shape how strongly my nethermind would
answer to it, 2. that fit with Jungian psychology, which seemed to have the best
grasp on the very deep, dark places of the mind, and 3. came from a time and
stead in the past that took it seriously, since that ought to mean it works.
Well, listing these benchmarks make it sound like I went through some
thoroughgoing search, poking and testing myth and magic from around the world,
but no. Instead, it was always clearly Germanish myth. Even when I was Christian
back in college, I would "joke" that if Christianity weren't true, I'd want to
go to Valhalla. Luckily, all elder polytheistic sets of beliefs fit with Jungian
psychology and had been held by large groups of folks, any of them would have
met those benchmarks. That being said, as you might have gathered from what I
said about Raymond's work above, I had landed on what some folks mean when they
say "soft polytheism" - I thought that the sundry Gods, Goddesses, and other
beings were sub-processes of my nethermind shared with the rest of mankind.
Powerful? Yes. Maybe scary sometimes? Yes. "Real" in any way other than "all of
mankind evolved these same personified shapes of thought?" Not so much.
</p>

<p>
On that footing, I started doing a lot of reading - learning the myths, reading
about what today's worshippers did, and a <i>lot</i> about the Runes. Whenever a writer
grounded what he was talking with the Gods as "really real," I'd say to myself
"yeah, sure thing, buddy," but even though I didn't think their way of
understanding the world was right, I worked to keep a fairly open mind to the
thought that they might know a thing or two about how to get the outcomes I
wanted. So, I started saying prayers. I started giving beer to the Gods and
wights (spirits). At some point, I read <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/how-not-to-learn-magic-an-introductory-note/">this</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-ritual/">set</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-meditation/">of</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-divination/">essays</a> by John Michael Greer
about what's needed for a well-rounded daily magical practice. Once again, I
thought his thoughts on <i>what</i> to do would be helpful, but I didn't buy <i>why</i> he
thought it worked. One bit of rede (advice) he gave was to "pick a course of
magical study and do it 'by the book' start to end," rather than making changes
or cobbling together your own thing. This seemed fair to me, so I started in on
the <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-nine-doors-of-midgard-a-curriculum-of-rune-work-revised-and-expanded-5th-with-new-preface-edred-thorsson/8994649?ean=9780971204485">The Nine Doors of Midgard</a> from the Rune Gild. I bethought (meditated). I
prayed. I cast the Runes. I did daily Hammer Rituals. I followed everything the
book said to do.
</p>

<p>
All along the way, when it came to weighing what to bring into my understanding
of the myths or into my practice, authenticity seemed like the only way to work
out what was worthwhile or not that made sense. What do the writings from the
middle ages say? What does archaeology tell us about the practices of Iron Age
Germanish folks? Was this practice a later borrowing from Christianity, or a
heathen practice that kept going into Christianity? Anything that smacked of
being lately made up, borrowing from other folkways or sets of teachings, or
lacking tokens that it was thought or done in the Iron Age or early middle ages
was <i>at best</i> a patch to fill in the unlucky gaps of a wondrous, fully authentic
reconstruction of the beliefs of elder times.
</p>

<p>
There was just one problem.
</p>

<p>
It felt <i>wholly</i> like talking to myself. I'd say prayers and get no answer, not
even a feeling or hunch I could put down to my nethermind. I'd do rituals that
didn't seem to do anything and I didn't feel anything while doing them. The one
bit that did seem to be working was Runecasting. I would get some insights on
the things I asked, but it felt more like seeing something more clearly that I
already knew than like tapping into a spring of timeless wisdom. I kept on with
the practices for a while, hoping I'd get to where they did <i>something</i>, but
between my mom dying and my first daughter being born, it got harder and harder
to spend 30-45 minutes of my day talking to myself, until I just stopped.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I had kept on reading Greer's blog, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net">Ecosophia</a>. Here was this
guy following a rather <i>inauthentic</i> religion*, Revival Druidry, seemingly in full
earnest, calmly and unruffably putting forth the literal, non-metaphorical
reality of non-bodily thinking beings like Gods, and <i>yet</i> on everything else, he
kept on making sense. His takes on what happened in the past and why it came
about were insightful and even-handed. On politics, he was good at spotting what
was wrong with every side of a given issue. On spiritual matters, his rede was
always down-to-earth, principled, and clearly wise. So, I thought "why not read
his book on many-godded (polytheistic) godlore, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-world-full-of-gods-an-inquiry-into-polytheism-john-michael-greer/18731823?ean=9781801520805">World Full of Gods</a>." As I've
talked about <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#org385e1cb">elsewhere</a>, this book shook my atheistic materialist worldview and
made me wonder if maybe the trouble with all the practices I had tried was that
I <i>knew I was faking it</i> the whole time.
</p>

<p>
*(Speaking on behalf of Greer, he has never said that his religion goes back to
pre-Christian druids of Celtic lands, and as the leader of the Ancient Order of
Druids in America, he made that straightforwardness the official policy of the
organization. So <i>he</i> has always spoken of his religion authentically, but for
many years, Revival Druids <i>did</i> say that they were the holders of a set of
teachings from elder times.)
</p>

<p>
So, I told myself I'd do an experiment. I'd spend a few weeks, maybe a few
months, being at least <i>open</i> to the thought that the Gods were really real, not
just archetypes, not just tides of the nethermind, but Beings outside of me with
Their own goals, ends, and so forth. I once again took up JMG's "magical
tripod," this time with his <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/26433.html">Heathen Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram</a>
plus <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/31086.html">Heathen Middle Pillar</a> for my ritual, some guided threads on the Runes from
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-teutonic-way-magic-kveldulf-gundarsson/14479256?ean=9781989033265">The Teutonic Way: Magic</a> for bethinking, and a daily Runecasting for divination.
The practices weren't that unlike what I had tried to do with the <i>Nine Doors of
Midgard</i>, but the mindset very much was.
</p>

<p>
Think on my shock when, after two weeks of this, I have a very strong religious
experience, with shaking and tingling all over my body and leaving me with an
unshakable ecstatic feeling. I won't share the details, as it was very personal,
but it's enough to say that I had set myself an experiment to see if "openness
to the existence of the Gods" shaped the outcomes I got from religious and
magical practice, and this was a screaming, blinding "YES!" that I couldn't
overlook.
</p>

<p>
I said the practices weren't that unalike, but did you heed something I slipped
in there? These practices were much less <i>authentic</i> - The Lesser Banishing Ritual
of the Pentagram is a Golden Dawn ritual, which drew heavily fromn Eliphas
Levi's rituals in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-doctrine-and-ritual-of-high-magic-a-new-translation-eliphas-levi/11711532?ean=9780143111030">The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic</a>, which was itself a
re-working of Renaissance magical practices, which mostly derived from Late
Hellenistic practices, which said they came from Egypt, who got them from the
God Thoth-Hermes. The Middle Pillar exercise is built on the Tree of Life of the
Cabala, which again, the Golden Dawn made heavy use of thanks to Levi bringing
it back, after it had been used widely by Renaissance Christian occultists, who
got it from High Medieval/Renaissance Jewish occultists, who re-worked it from
earlier Hellenistic Neoplatonic models, who got it from who knows where/came up
with it.
</p>

<p>
Notice what's missing? <i>Anything at all to do with Iron Age or early middle ages
Germanish practices</i>. The only link was that in these rituals, I called upon the
names of Germanish Gods, brought to mind things from Germanish myths, and
visualized the Runes at some steps. And yet these practices led to a
life-changing happening and a seemingly-abiding shift in metaphysical outlook.
</p>

<p>
So, clearly, authenticity wasn't the end-all, be-all I had thought it to be.

<h3 id="orga24153c">We Put a Lot of Worth on Authenticity as a Terminal Value Since It Feels Grounded</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga24153c">
<p>
So how did I, along with many others, end up seeing authenticity as <i>the</i> way to
weigh the worth of spiritual teachings and practices? Well, one thing is that if
you aren't following the religion that you grew up with (and at some point,
maybe even if you are), you have to work out "why do I believe this and not one
of the zillions of other religions out there?" This is a struggle that most
folks in most times have not had to deal with - you believed whatever your folk
believed, the end. Today's world gives us the freedom to do otherwise, but with
the high cost of working out what to believe, why to believe it, and what to do
with it. Authenticity is one way to go through the beliefs out there and clump
them together or pull them apart. As such, authenticity can work as a benchmark
for <i>categorization</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now, categorization is very helpful - it's one of mankind's key thinking skills,
and a lot of what we have done is built on it. So I'm not crapping on
categorization. The trouble is that there is not, and never can be, a way of
categorizing that is not grounded in some sense of what is more (and what is
less) <i>worthwhile</i> - in other words, in <i>values</i>. Scott Alexander has a classic post
on this called <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">The Categories Were Made for Man, Not Man for the Categories</a>. You
should read it, but one of the long-running examples in the post is the made-up
struggle of a Biblical-times Judean working out what category to put a whale in.
Folks today see a whale called a "fish" in the Bible and think "hahah, how
stupid, a whale is so clearly a mammal! Those backwards dopes!" Alexander,
though, talks us through <i>why</i> that seems so clear to us and wouldn't even have
occurred to some of the folks in Judea. Bring to mind, if you will, a Judean
functionary given the task of gathering taxes and tariffs on seafood brought in
by fishermen. When one of these fishermen brings in the biggest damned flippered
thing ever dragged out of the ocean and is ready to make his riches by carving
nearly endless filets off of its bulk, do you think our tax collector friend is
going to find it very funny when the fisherman says "that's no fish, it's a
mammal!"? Likely not, right? If you mainly care about understanding a whale by
what other animals does it share the closest forebearers with, then a cladistic
understanding that Whales are mammals that went in the water and turned all
funny is helpful. On the other hand, if you want to make sure that the king gets
taxes on every swimming thing that folks haul out of the water to eat, and the
law says to tax "fish," you better believe it's more helpful to think of the
whale as a fish (to you, in that stead, in that time).
</p>

<p>
What makes this still tougher, though, is that authenticity works <i>both</i> as a
benchmark for "does belief A belong in this category or not?" <i>as well</i> as a
grounding for worth (authentic is better than inauthentic). If it's only <i>one</i>
such weight of worth, then okay, no trouble. But what about when you give it the
<i>last</i> say on what is worthwhile and what is not? What if it becomes your <i>terminal
value</i>? Working out how to think about terminal values is <i>hard</i> - you can't see if
it brings about some other good, you can't weigh it like something with a body -
everything else you deem worthwhile grounds out in your terminal value. If you
want more of a feeling for how hard this is, see <i>all of Western philosophy</i>.
Really. It's that hard. But authenticity makes for a welcoming terminal value,
most of all to Americans of this day and age, and so many of us find ourselves
building our other values off of it, without knowing that's what we're up to.
How come?
</p>

<p>
I think there are three main things that lead us to turn to authenticity as a
terminal value, most of all for spiritual things. Going roughly from what we are
most aware of to what we're least aware of. First, authenticity feels like a
terminal value you can get behind pretty strongly, even with a wholly
materialist outlook. Did this set of teachings come from where it said it did?
If yes, huzzah! It's worthwhile. If not, great! Into the bin with you! Either
way, no need for metaphysical hoo-hah. Now, of course, if you have two teachings
that both come from where they say they do, how do you pick between them? What
makes one better than the other? Are the teachings from Tibet in 1400 CE better
than the ones I came up with last week? How come? Both come from where they said
they do, so how do we tell them apart? Whoops, looks like you have to use some
values besides authenticity. Oh well.
</p>

<p>
Next, authenticity is <i>deeply</i> interwoven with how the West has always dealt with
spiritual validity. I hope I'm not shocking anyone when I let slip that for a
little more than a thousand years, if you were in the West, and you wanted to
know "is this spiritually valid?" the answer was mostly "well, what does the
Bible say about it?" Yeah, yeah, I know, there was a lot more to it than that,
most of all before the Reformation, and most Christians did not take the Bible
as literally as some fundamentalists do today, but even still, all valid
spiritual truth was seen as coming from God, and the Bible was seen as the word
of God, so almost all askings about spiritual validity came down to whether they
were backed up in the one authentic wellspring of truth, the Bible. I think that
this habit of thought and belief has become very deeply impressed in our psyches
and ways of thinking about things. If I can bring up another Greer work, we
greatly prefer <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/">episteme over gnosis</a>. Many "free thinking" pagans, New Agers, and
whatever else have traded one "only well-spring of all truth" for another.
</p>

<p>
And the last that I'd bring up, the one of which we're least aware, is that I
think authenticity soothes our roaring insecurity. Thanks to modernity, and
globalization and what not, everyone has somewhat had to deal with feeling cut
off from deep, true beliefs and folkways. As I said above, most of mankind to
ever live just believed what their folk believed, their folk had believed it
since before anyone could remember, and what they believed was linked with the
lands where they lived. There was a weight and a depth there, such that a lot of
practices kept on well past when anyone knew what they meant or why they did
them, but that was just how it had always been, and so they held onto some
strength. But modernity has messed with all that, and in America, it's hard to
say that the non-American Indians <i>ever</i> had that. We're a new country full of
folks who just got here, if you take a wide enough outlook, and deep down, we
all know this. So I think we seek what feels grounded, and authenticity does, at
least sometimes.
</p>

<p>
In hindsight, what has dawned on me is that the harder someone leans on
authenticity to prop up his religion, the more likely he is <i>LARPing</i>. Now, I've
been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123053702/http://brunching.com/images/geekchart.pdf">looking down my nose at LARPers</a> for a good, long time, so I'm not using
this because it's become a more common phrase lately, I'm putting forth a true
likeness. Both LARPers and hardcore reconstructionists might like what they're
doing, they might get great gladness from it, it might be a big and weighty bit
of their life that furthers some of their closest bonds - but deep down, both
know they're <i>pretending to be something they're not</i>. Kidding aside, playing
pretend is a deeply human thing to do, and I'm not crapping on it, but it is not
what everyone is looking for from a religion, and I bet that many folks either
hope that it will work notwithstanding misgivings, or else tell themselves
that's not what's happening and act like everything's okay.

<h3 id="org61ca82f">Instead Authenticity Should Shape and Hold Up Validity - But Not Stand In For It</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org61ca82f">
<p>
And yet&#x2026; Didn't folks in elder times have understanding about things we don't?
Didn't they grow up Heathen (or Pagan, or truly Orthodox, or whatever), take it
as given, live and breath it? Didn't they live before modernity choked the life
and <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/the-nature-of-enchantment/">enchantment</a> out of everything? Didn't I say that authenticity helped us
avoid fake, bad stuff? So, why should we strive for authenticity as a way to
learn from them and do what works? Maybe LARPing something authentic is better
than earnestly believing something fake?
</p>

<p>
Now we have at last gotten to the insight that let me write this work. I was
reading a book review by Charles Haywood of <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2017/10/25/book-review-augustus-first-emperor-of-rome-adrian-goldsworthy/">Augustus: First Emperor of Rome</a>,
which went some ways I wasn't exactly looking for in a classical history book
review. Towards the end, he works out his own meaning for "reaction" as its own
thing that isn't "conservatism." Don't worry, I'm not getting political here,
just bear with me a tick! He sees conservatism as trying to hold onto what we
already have that's good - straightforward enough. "Reaction," on the other
hand, he sees as seeking some kind of big change, grounded not in theory or
ideology, but rather in what has worked in the past to get the kind of outcomes
wanted. Something new built out of bits of the past, you might say. This struck
me as rather like how I have come to look at cobbling together a meaningful
religious practice outside of an settled set of ways, teachings, and beliefs. I
had started with "stick with what worked in the past!" (That is, always go for
authenticity.) A time came when I saw that wasn't working and I needed something
new. I could tell, though, that making something up from whole cloth was very
unlikely to work that great, and might instead go terribly wrong (think
"Heaven's Gate" or "Jonestown"). So, rather than go with something wholly old,
or wholly new, I found a way to look to what had worked in the past, pick the
bits that fit in with my overall aesthetic, ethical, and religious outlook, and
give them a try. Maybe the weightiest change, though, was I now had seen and
felt what it means for a religious practice to have <i>validity</i> with or without
authenticity - I knew what it felt like when it <i>worked</i>. This has been a game
changer, when put next to the stumbling around pretending I was doing as a
materialist.
</p>

<p>
(By the way, I found Haywood and his book reviews when I was looking for
podcasts with/about JMG and found the audio version of his review of <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2021/01/01/retrotopia-john-michael-greer/">Retrotopia</a>,
so synchronicity, mayhaps?)
</p>

<p>
If I might say so, I think my work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> fits this way of doing
things pretty well. I have looked to the past for templates, like the Rosary
itself, the Germanish poetic meters, the imagery and symbolism from the myths,
and so forth. But I'm tweaking and putting together and cutting based on prayer,
intuition, and seeing what works and what doesn't. I have no illusions that
anyone in 5th century England prayed anything like this, nor do I think it will
look much like the Catholic Rosary when I'm through, either.
</p>

<p>
The thing is, though, I don't <i>care</i> that it's not what was done in the past. I
care whether I find the <i>heart</i> of what has made these myths echo through the ages
and this way of praying have such deep spiritual outcomes for so many. Gods
willing, and with help from you reading this, I'll find a way to make something
that partakes of the deep worth of these models and brings them to some folks
who wouldn't have found it otherwise.
</p>

<p>
That's the goal anyway: not to be authentic, but to be <i>true</i>.

<p>
If I had to put how this book made me feel into one word, that word would be
<i>maddening</i>. Not since it has nothing of worth - oh no, that would be far less
wrathsome. Instead, the book is <i>very</i> uneven, some ways shallow, but some fairly
deep. I now have deeply mixed feelings about buying in one go all of the "Odhinn
Trilogy" of which this is the first volume. Even still, I think if I come at
these books like an archaeologist, brushing aside the midden and the sherds to
find the riches buried within, I might find them worthwhile nonetheless. So!
This rundown of the book is my first step in shaking out the wheat from the
chaff, but also I just <i>had</i> to get some of this off my chest, so I am sorry if I

<h3 id="org673d406">The Writer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org673d406">
<p>
Here's how Shani Oates <a href="https://www.anathemapublishing.com/shani-oates">tells you who she is</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Occultist, Mystic, Luciferian Pilgrim of the Forbidden Arts, Traditional Craft
Practitioner, researcher, lecturer, historian, and writer of the Craft, Magic,
Ancestral Tradition, particularly the Robert Cochrane Tradition, and the
cultural Folk-lore and Folk-magicks of the Uk and its Northern Heritage.
Spae-wife and Matriarch of The People of Goda, The Clan of Tubal Cain. Student
of Anthropology, Tantra, Philosophy, and the arcane ‘Other.’
</p>

<p>
Author of several books that write informatively on the myths, gods, and
archetypes that imbue and inform the Cults and Crafts of Witchcraft and
Folk-Traditions, shifting through the arcane to modern times.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The word that really jumped out at me, and gave me some pause in ordering this
book at all, is "Luciferian." Now, in case you don't know, we're not dealing
with "literal Devil worship" here, necessarily. "Luciferian" is one of many
titles that folks in the Western Esoteric Tradition use to describe themselves
if they are on the "Left Hand Path" (not to be confused with the "Left Hand
Path" of Tantric Yoga/Buddhism, but there are <i>some</i> similarities). I'm not that
knowledgable on this stuff, but I've gathered a bit. The most sympathetic way to
put what the "LHP" is about is seeking knowledge and enlightenment <i>whatever the
cost</i> - schools of thought within the LHP argue that social norms, taboos, rules,
strictures, and so forth, are all obstacles to true, cosmic knowledge, and that
such things must be set aside to learn the deepest secrets. This tends to come
bundled with radical individualism and an ethos of seizing things through might
and daring. The better sort of LHP folks carefully wall-off all of this
taboo-breaking, seizing-by-might stuff in ritual contexts and acknowledge that
rules, restrictions, and norms are <i>mostly</i> very helpful, even if the path to
enlightenment sometimes involves breaking them. This better end of things often
looks rather like "shadow work" in a Jungian framework - acknowledging the
darker bits of yourself and working to make them a bit of the whole self. One
author I still draw on a lot who has been an avowed member of LHP organizations
is Edred Thorsson (Dr. Stephen Flowers) - many Heathens found out about these
associations and grew suspicious that his work was "tainted," but for myself,
I've learned to recognize when he starts veering into more LHP stuff and to
quietly set that aside, then get back to the good stuff.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, that's the <i>ideal</i>, but I have picked up from <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/">John Michael Greer</a> a general
policy of not associating with LHP folks and to cast a suspicious eye on their
thinking and works. All that stuff about radical individualism and breaking
norms to attain the highest kinds of enlightenment? That sounds pretty good for
<i>the person doing it</i> (or at least it might, to some kinds of folks, and I'll
admit, I have some of those tastes). But what about everyone around that person?
What tends to happen almost every time is that folks who enthusiastically
embrace an LHP ethos end up as world class jerks. At a minimum, they want to be
seen as the rebels they long to be, so they will push and push until the folks
around them get sick of it and push back, at which point they get to say
something like "I knew you guys were just part of the Man!" and storm out in a
rebellious huff. I don't personally have any experience with magical groups, but
I've met folks like this, and it's a pattern I recognize, so I'm happy to borrow
JMG's experience here and assume his rule is a sensible one.
</p>

<p>
Now, all that being said, I get the impression that Ms. Oates is at the better
end of things, and that her LHP lens doesn't change <i>everything</i> in the book. But
there are some times where it jumps out, and it's a bit tiresome. Here's some
chapter titles that give you a taste: "Gold Mead: Elixir of Forbidden
Enchantments," or "Yggdrassill: Dread Steed of the Damned." Now, as we'll cover
below, she does have <i>some</i> reason to refer to what Odhinn is doing as "forbidden"
and him as "damned," at least in her interpretive framework. But still, don't
these strike you as just a bit "Hot Topic"? Throughout the book, there are hints
of this wallowing in the grisly and shocking, which is <i>maybe</i> sometimes helpful
for such a challenging God as Odhinn, but mostly strikes me as childish.
</p>

<p>
Another bit of her background that seemed relevant to me is her Wiccan grounding
(that's what "Traditional Craft Practitioner" means). Wiccans believe that all
Gods are one God, and that all Goddesses are one Goddess, and the God and the
Goddess coming together in a sacred marriage is one of their core symbolic
images. This means that 1. Wiccans can be a bit quick to equate one God with
another, if they happen to both be men (or women), and 2. They can tend to see
any contact between a God and a Goddess as "truly" being a <i>hieros gamos</i>, a
sacred wedding - yes, this is truly a widespread and weighty mythic element, but
it's not literally <i>everywhere</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I hate to say this, as this work (and the others) show a great deal of
time and sweat put into them, and clearly Ms. Oates is more widely-read in the
lore than I am, but some of her writing style and way of doing/sharing research
had me literally yelling foul words at the book, and I'm not proud to say, at
her. First off, she <i>way</i> over-uses the passive voice. This would be annoying to
me, as I teach Business Writing, and pretty much the main commandment there is
"Thou shalt not write in passive voice." What makes it <i>far</i> worse here, though,
is sometimes it actually makes things substantively harder to understand - "it
is regarded" - by whom? By you? By most scholars in the field today? By
worshiping heathens? By the sock puppets you talk to? Also, footnotes are
sometimes sloppy - like putting a foot note at the end of a quote that <i>doesn't
give the source of the quote, but rather a thought about it</i>. Or, putting the
abbreviated citation in a footnote, and then leaving that work out of the
bibliography (such as "See Kiessey (2005)," and then there's no "Kiessey" in the
bibliography!). Or, gesturing at an <i>entire book</i> after giving a <i>direct quote</i>,
rather than giving a page number. What made this especially maddening is that
often I <i>wanted</i> to follow up more, because it was an interesting point that
seemed to come from an interesting work. Also, though I talk about this below in
the bit about editing, there were many times where Ms. Oates used words in ways
that are just wrong, like "exorcise his authority." She also uses academicese
less than perfectly. The overall impression I got was of someone trying too hard
to impress the reader, which is a shame, since there's plenty of worthwhile
stuff in this book that would be impressive enough if written straightforwardly.
Here's a bit from the conclusion that shows many of the above points:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All conclusions grow out [of] a subjective experience. It is our contention,
therefore, that this body of work can only be drawn together by the threads
woven in life as it is known, and therefore bound within the parameters of
understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What does that even mean? Is she trying to say you can only make sense of this
work by relating it to your own life and experience? I guess.
</p>

<h3 id="org85c01cb">The Main Thrust</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org85c01cb">
<p>
Okay, with all that out of the way, let's talk about what Oates has to share.
This is the first book of three that Oates has written about Odhinn, and she
plans on writing even more about the "Northern Otherworld." The focus of this
one is on Odhinn's links with death and what seemingly unalike bits of myth have
to do with one another. She puts forth that Odhinn's "hanging" is best
understood not as hanging from the neck until dead, but rather a kind of ordeal
by suspension with sacrifices of men and animals (that <i>are</i> hanging from the neck
until dead) in the trees/on poles all around him. Hanged men <i>are</i> somewhat
identified with Odhinn, as they become "his," but she does not believe his
"hanging form a windy tree" was <i>literally</i> a sacrificial hanging - instead,
Odhinn's true self-sacrifice is at Ragnarok, when he is eaten by Fenris. One of
the more interesting claims in the book, and one that I don't know that I buy,
is that Odhinn's <i>Einherjar</i> (chosen slain warriors) were understood as the bodily
undead <i>draugr</i>, and that <i>Vallholl</i> is best understood as inside grave mounds,
filled by these <i>draugr</i>. The myths of Odhinn gaining various kinds of knowledge
(which she insists on identifying as "taboo" and "forbidden") are given their
meaning by Odhinn's sacrifice at Ragnarok - getting eaten by Fenris is the
payment for his forbidden magics and knowledge, and it's a price he pays
willingly to make sure that Gods and Men make it through to the other side.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org955a2fe" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org955a2fe">Some Other Things I Found Interesting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org955a2fe">
<p>
Now I'd like to share some of the things I found interesting or maybe worth
looking more into, but these are not all that organized. In the long run, I
think these bits are more likely to be what sticks with me from the book and for
me to build on with later reading.
</p>

<p>
For one, her discussion of grave mounds and <i>draugar</i> brought in <i>a lot</i> of
references to widely-spread sources, so I'm thankful for that road to go down
for further research. What was <i>also</i> interesting to me about these bits was how
they called to mind John Michael Greer's book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/monsters-an-investigator-s-guide-to-magical-beings-third-edition-revised-and-expanded-john-michael-greer/17445432?ean=9781913504588">Monsters</a>, which gives a thumbnail
history of a practice spread across all of Eurasia of building mounds so that
the spirit of a dead ruler could stick around to help out, and how this practice
devolved into vampirism. Digging in there might be worthwhile whether or not the
conclusions she draws about the <i>draugar</i>'s links with Odhinn pan out. I think she
is slightly off in emphasizing the corporeality of the <i>draugar</i>, as Greer's work
offers what I find a more satisfying explanation: the beings that once haunted
grave mounds are <i>etheric</i> mainly. This is one of many steads where old school
occult philosophy helps make sense of things that are otherwise puzzling. Very
briefly, the etheric plane is the plane of "life energy," and it is the
"closest" to the material plane. Etheric material is usually unseen and freely
interpenetrates physical matter, but certain practices and conditions can render
it able to interact with matter. This is why ghosts can sometime affect physical
objects but also can go through walls. The various things <i>draugar</i> are said to do
all make sense if they're etheric, rather than material, and grave mounds were
one way elder folks kept the etheric body alive after material death. One more
fun thing: in the same book, Greer argues that dragons are likely best
understood as ethereal beings, and links modern lake monsters like Nessie with
the dragon tradition. Oates talks about how some mound-dwellers became dragons
in Norse stories - so, that'd be a cool link, if right.
</p>

<p>
Okay, the next thing I found interesting actually <i>does</i> come out of her
overly-left-hand-path framing that I mostly don't buy, but I think it can still
make sense outside of that frame. As I said above, she says that some of the
magic and knowledge Odhinn gains truly are <i>forbidden</i>, even to the king of the
Gods, and that nobody gets to use them without paying a price, and Odhinn's
death at Ragnarok is that price. What she links this with, though, is the
thought that Baldr's death was his way of getting around that - since Baldr
would ride out Ragnarok in Hel, he would be around to lead the Gods in the new
world to come after. I'd seen the idea that Baldr's death was somehow needed, so
that he'd be around after Ragnarok, but not that Odhinn made it happen to ensure
the preservation of the Godly order of the world.
</p>

<p>
Of especial interest to me given my ongoing work on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> was
Oates's discussion of the three times Odhinn gained knowledge, and what links
them thematically. I've been looking into these three myths a lot lately as I'm
getting started working on a new version of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">All Father</a>. The three myths I
mean are when Odhinn gets the Mead of Poetry from Gunnlodh, when he drinks from
Mimir's Well of Memory, and when he gains the Runes by hanging upon "the tree."
Oates puts these into a progression of sorts - the Mead of Poetry is the raw
inspiration, Mimir's Well gives the memory and skills needed to best use that
inspiration, and the Runes allow it to be shaped to magical ends. I was groping
toward a similar understanding, but this gave me some good stuff to work with.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Mimir, there was a lot of interesting stuff about him in this book.
For one, remember how I said that Oates links Odhinn with the mound-dwelling
<i>draugar</i>? Well, something that happens in more than one saga is that someone,
usually a descendant of the lord buried in the mound, goes in there, fights the
<i>draugr</i>, cuts his head off, and then takes his sword. She argues that this was a
way of "claiming an ancestral birthright," but it had to be earned through the
combat. Building on this, she makes the case that Odhinn beheaded Mimir (rather
than the Vanir after they learned Hoenir was dependent on his counsel), and that
this was a way of taking ownership of Mimir's gifts, knowledge, and power. She
also clearly laid out something I have run into before, but didn't know it's
grounding: why folks say that Mimir might have been Odhinn's mother's brother.
It's <i>Havamal</i> stanza 140:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nine mighty songs<br />
I learned from the great son of<br />
Bale-thorn, Bestla's sire;<br />
I drank a measure of the wondrous Mead,<br />
With the Soul-stirrer's drops I was showered.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm a bit embarrassed I hadn't caught that one myself before, but thank goodness
I know now.

She gives the meaning of <i>Idhunna</i> as "Oldest/First of all mothers," which is very
interesting for my own thoughts about Her, but this is one of those maddening
times that she <i>doesn't explain herself or cite anyone at all</i>. Maria Kvilhaug
gives a very different meaning to her name, as "Goddess of the Field of Water
Sources," and she is kind enough to spell out why and how she got to that
meaning. Altogether, I felt like her handling of Idhunna was fairly
disappointing. As my work on the Heathen Rosary makes clear, I have found a bond
between Idun and Woden that rings true to me, so I'm always interested when
other folks talk about that. Here, though, I think that Oates maybe goes too
far, as she states that Idhunna is all of: The Well of Wyrd, the World Tree, the
Sun, Mother Earth, and Fate. I think she has important links with all of these
concepts (and I'll admit, I may not have been giving her turning into a wolf in
<i>Hrafnagaldur Oðins</i> enough weight), but to say that she <i>is</i> all of these things at
once seems like too much conflation to me.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Fenris, one bit that I still don't know how to feel about, but I
find interesting, is that Oates argues that Odhinn's steed is not a horse, but a
<i>wolf</i>, and that that wolf is, wait for it, Fenris. Now, there is definitely
something interesting going on with Odhinn and wolves, but this one seems to
flat out go against what it says in our best sources, where we have the tale of
Fenris's binding and the siring of Sleipnir by a <i>horse</i> explicitly.
</p>

<p>
She also has a nice take on poetry and why it is so centrally important to
Odhinn and his followers: as a tool of memory, it preserves stories, it carries
forward the deeds of the past and stops them from being forgotten. As such, it
is a tool of Order in the never-ending fight against Chaos. I don't think she
explicitly made the same claim for Runes, but it seems like they would have a
similar weight, as a way of writing down what has happened. We tend to take
records of the past for granted these days, but the fact that folks could know
what had happened before the memory of anyone alive, or even their grandparents,
must have been more clearly seen as the deep magic it truly is by those who had
not been numbed by familiarity.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and on the Runes, one of the few mentions the Futhark gets (as opposed to
the Rune songs spoken of in <i>Havamal</i>) is to link each of the three Aetts with one
of the three drinks Odhinn took (she assumes, as do I, that some kind of drink
must have been involved in the winning of the Runes, though it's not spelled out
as clearly as with Gunnlodh and Mimir). I haven't put much thought into this one
yet, but I bet it will be good fodder for bethinking (meditation).

<h3 id="orgd3f567c">The Book Itself</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3f567c">
<p>
This is not usually something I would talk about when going over a book, but
here I think it's warranted, both good and bad. First off, the good stuff:
Anathema Publishing specializes in limited runs of <i>very</i> nice hardcovers, but
they have branched out a bit to also offer merely "nice" hardcovers and even
paperbacks of some titles, though a recent news post has me thinking they might
be pulling back from that strategy. At any rate, I got the "Standard Edition"
hard cover of this book, and you can tell that they take the craft of book
binding seriously. It is a lovely book - nice, thick paper, exquisitely printed
text, quality binding, understated but classy cloth covering with an embossed
bindrune. I'm a bit of a typograpy and printing nerd, and so I appreciate this
stuff, even if I'm not much of a book "collector." So that's all great!
</p>

<p>
Unluckily, that's not all there is to say about how the book was made. It seems
that in their focus on book bindery, Anathema is <i>not</i> quite as obsessive about
some of the other services publishers offer their authors and readers. Like copy
editing. There are a lot of typos, and some of them <i>render the meaning
ambiguous</i> - like no "not" where you're pretty sure it should be there, but the
sentence <i>kinda</i> makes sense without it. Also, Ms. Oates has several instances
where she uses a homophone or nearly soundalike word where something else is
clearly meant - such as "exorcise his authority." (Lit nerd time: these are
known as "malapropisms" after a character, Mrs. Malaprop, in Richard Brinsley
Sheridan's 1775 play <i>The Rivals</i>). A good editor would have caught at least most
of these. I was all ready to decry Oates's use of "self-immolation" for Odhinn's
hanging himself as "a gift of myself, to myself," since I always thought
immolation implied the burning up part of Classical sacrifices, but it seems I
was wrong on that count - immolation is just a synonym for "sacrifice," and in
fact etymologically derives from the Roman custom of giving <i>flour</i>, not the burnt
meat offerings I always assumed. But the <i>really</i> jarring thing, one that I don't
know whether to lay at the feet of Ms. Oates or of Anathema Publishing is the
<i>constant</i> misuse of the letter Eth (Ð,ð). This letter is used in modern
Scandinavian tongues, and in the transcription of Old Norse and Old English, to
represent the "voiced dental fricative" (the "th" sound in "that" rather than in
"thing"). It appears that somewhere in the production of this book, whether in
the original manuscript, the typesetting process, or something, Eth got used as
a "fancy d." Now, this is not a <i>crazy</i> thing to do, as historically, Old Norse
words with an Eth have been rendered in modern English with a "d" (most famous,
and relevant example: Old Norse <i>Oðinn</i> to Modern English "Odin"). What sucks is
that someone <i>over</i>-zealously flipped this rule around, such that words which
really did have a "d" in Old Norse are instead printed with an "ð". Like <i>ðvergr</i>
("dwarf") or <i>ðraugr</i> ("restless dead"), or even <i>skalð</i> ("skald" - a Viking-age
poet, like a bard). <i>All</i> of these should have "d" instead of "ð" - and it turns
up in lots of other, less-familiar words, which makes it harder to know what
it's supposed to be for someone like me who is passingly familiar with a lot of
Old Norse words, but lacks the thorough grounding to just "know" where there
should be a "d" and where an "ð". When I worked out this was happening, I almost
threw the book across the room, because I had spent a good deal of it
"relearning" how to pronounce some less familiar words. Oh, and one last
complaint - there is no index! <i>Every</i> non-fiction book ought to have an index,
but most of all works of a scholarly bent. Harumph. It was a real downer for
such a <i>lovely</i> book to have screw ups like this.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9bdcec6">
<p>
As you may have gathered, I found this book a very mixed bag. It had some
worthwhile insights and linked some dots I hadn't thought to put together and
brought to my heed some works I'm looking forward to digging into more (like
Zinner's translation and commentary on <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i>). On the other hand,
it had an overall viewpoint that I think got in the way of it being as helpful
as it could be, the writing and editing were actively distracting, and I think
some of the core assumptions and conclusions are mistaken. So, should <i>you</i> read
it? I think if you are <i>deeply</i> interested in Odhinn, there's some worthwhile
perspective and thoughts in here. If He is <i>not</i> an especial focus of yours, you
might just give this one a pass.

<p>
As I said before, <i>The Decline of the West</i> packs a <i>lot</i> into its two hefty volumes, much of it worth thinking about, reacting to, and linking to other works, but not all of which is as directly linked to the main ideas as what we've talked about so far in the series. So, I thought I'd go through the thoughts I wrote down while reading the book, the sayings I marked as well-said or thought-sparking, and any stray remarks from the earlier posts and start pulling out anything I wanted to share. So let's get to it!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Volume 1, Leaf 106 - Spengler makes the common claim that a fear of death is universal, and builds from there, but in <i>God is Read</i>, Vine Deloria, Jr. argues that Westerners may be projecting that onto other folks more than they know.</li>
<li>V1, L. 107 - I found Spengler's contrast of "Space" versus "Time" as the foundations of perception and world-feeling especially interesting after having just read Tyson Yunkaporta's <i>Sand Talk</i> and Vine Deloria Jr.'s <i>God Is Red</i>. Both writers point out how strong a contrast there is between the folkways of their forebearers and those of Westerners, and both stress the importance of "place" to their forebearers, in a way that today's Westerners truly don't get</li>
<li>V1, L. 160 - I've talked about Spengler's snobbery in past posts, and it's in full view here as he draws lines between "primitive man" and "great Cultures" in ways that I suspect are not wholly justified. That being said, I wonder what might come of rigorously applying his "Culture as organism" metaphor here - are the societies of "Primitive Men" a "different species" or merely an early phase of the same organism as "Great Cultures"? What might we learn by assuming each?</li>
<li>V1, L. 216 - Shared symbols define cultures - fair enough. This becomes far more interesting when you apply the kind of understanding of symbols that occultists and Jungians have to the term - representations <i>fraught</i> with meaning, some of which is inherent, some of which is put on the thing by the observer, and some of which only comes out in their interaction. In other words, how much of a Culture is seeing some bit of the world for how it "truly is," how much is an accident of how that Culture looks at some things, and how much is from the folk of that Culture talking with each other, making art, and otherwise bouncing these symbols and their meanings off of each other?</li>
<li>V1, L. 397 - Spengler thinks that "the Will" as its own distinct "thing," a bit of the soul you can point to unlike the rest of it, is a firmly Faustian thought, and that other Cultures plain don't see it as a standalone faculty</li>
<li>V1, L. 448 - Spengler talks about "Ethical Socialism" as what he sees as the best-possible expression of Faustian Civilization (remember, a Civilization is the more materially-advanced, but spiritually frozen successor to the live Culture). Personally, I think this is one stead where he falls for the myth of Progress (mark the capital 'P') that he is mostly so good about calling out</li>
<li>V1, L. 451 - I need to get around to reading <i>The Germanization of Christianity</i> by James C Russell (no relation, that I know of!), as Spengler talks about how Faustian Europe greatly changed the shape of the religion that the Romans brought north and west from the Levant.</li>
<li>V1, L. 475 - A "near-religious" obsession with bodily health (diet, tee-totaling, exercise, and so forth) is evidence of turning religious instincts and sensibilities toward the material world, which is clearly a turning away from the spiritual world.</li>
<li>V1, L. 478 - Spengler spells out in painful detail how the very Faustian thought of the "right to work," which started as a way of seeing everyone as worthy of dignity, but needing to prove they can earn it, turned into the Western equivalent of "Bread and Circuses" - the thing the powerful can distribute as patronage to get voters/foot soldiers on their side. And so, the very thing fought for so hard by generations of labor representatives, seamlessly mutates into the "duty to work," the engine that drives the rat race, consumerism, and so much more</li>
<li>V1, L. 497 - The West seeks "conquest by measurement," which already struck me as weighty when I read it over a year ago, but jives rather well with John Michael Greer's post from a couple months back <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/the-reign-of-quantity/">The Reign of Quantity</a>.</li>
<li>V1, L. 528 - He goes into how the religious "world-feeling" of dawning Cultures happened during their "epic" phase - the Homeric Age (~1100 - 800 BCE) for the Classical and the "Teutonic" Age for Faustian (~900 - 1200 CE). I think he is <i>too</i> dismissive of the earlier tales that were the raw inputs for the great works of myth written down in these times, but he makes a good point that the versions that have come down to us were worked up at particular times, conveying the worldview of particular folks, and it is likely foolish to see them as "pure" expressions of the older tales from which they draw the heroes, plots, and other bits.</li>
<li>V1, L. 537 - The Classical culture saw divinity as local, embodied, and specific, whereas the Magian saw it as universal, immanent, and transcendental. If we allow that every Culture sees some bit of Being clearly that others miss, this gives us some good food for bethinking (meditation).</li>
<li>V1, L. 542 - Classical "toleration" was merely the stretching out of what they already believed - unalike steads and unalike folks have unalike Gods, and it's right to worship the right God at the right stead, at the right time, with the right folk, and not to do so elsewhere/elsewhen. Spengler claims that the Western flavor of "toleration" is only a lack of religious sensibility, due to shifting into the worldlier Civilization phase of its lifecycle. He goes so far as to say that "Megalopolitan Man" (the typical resident of the major city/cities of Culture-turned-Civilization - think someone who lives in today's New York, London, or Berlin) <i>must</i> be lying to himself if he thinks he's religious. I think this is overly harsh, but in broad terms, there's some truth there.</li>
<li>V2, L. 13 - Folks who like "thought" - abstract, mostly verbal, logical conceptions of things - tend to put far more weight on "thought" than it deserves. Taleb and others call out folks like this as "Intellectuals Yet Idiots" or, more commonly, "nerds".</li>
<li>V2, L. 20 - Another bit that made me think about Yunkaporta and Deloria - here, Spengler contrasts the "thought-about life" with plain old "life".</li>
<li>V2, L. 37 - Spengler is hella critical of Darwinism, which can't help but strike today's reader as hopelessly old-fashioned and ridiculous, but I found it a helpful reminder to take a hard look at those thoughts we take as given, and ask whether we believe them since they best fit or own experience of what the world is like and how it works, or since someone once told us that's how it is.</li>
<li>V2, L. 68 - I've said before that I think Spengler is too harsh on the thought that one Culture can "influence" another, but her he gives a worked-out example of what he means, and it makes pretty good sense. He says that "Buddhism" did not cross over into China from India. Instead, when Indians started coming to China and talking about this "Buddhism" thing and what you had to do everyday if you took it seriously, some Chinese folks, of certain religious sensibilities, saw things that spoke to them in Buddhism and enthusiastically took up (a subset of) Buddhist practices and beliefs, and did with them what their religious sensibilities told them was best, resulting in a <i>very</i> different religion than original Indian "Buddhism." Spengler uses this as an example of how "influence" can be hard to pin down and maybe meaningless to claim, while there still might be lots of "influenced" folks.</li>
<li>V2, L. 72 - Spengler claims that "Law" seems to have a lot of continuity from, say, the Romans through the civil codes of early modern continental reformers, and so on, but truly, the ideas of how to handle disputes, what deeds are okay and what not, and so forth, are wildly unalike, but using similar language and "justifications" to claim legitimacy.</li>
<li>V2, L. 98 - Maybe Faustian culture invented archaeology, anthropology, archaeogenetics, and so forth <i>precisely</i> because the past is <i>far away</i>, which makes it exciting to the Faustian mind in a way it's not to folks from other cultures.</li>
<li>V2, L. 123 - Spengler talks about the "rational planning" of megalopolitan cities, and it reminds me of the thought of "legibility" as originally talked about in <i>Seeing Like a State</i> by James C. Scott (still need to read this), and as slightly tweaked by Lou Keep in his posts on  <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk Machines</a>. The short version is that states and other centralizing tendencies want everything to be rationally understandable, but in rendering them so, sometimes (almost always) things that used to work get broken</li>
<li>V2, L. 127 - A lot of takes have been put out about why "advanced societies" stop making babies, and most of them are economic or sociological, or what have you. Spengler puts forward a spiritual reason: once the question "why is life worth living, what's it all about?" is taken seriously enough by enough folks, then the thought that <i>Life</i> is a self-evident, bedrock principle is eroded. As Spengler says, the peasant whose family has farmed the same land for a thousand years doesn't have to ask "why should I go harvest the grain and teach my kids to do it?" That's just how it <i>is</i>. The man of the big city, though, has grown used to asking "what am I even doing here? does it mean anything?" and so the thought "how would a child cope with this?" is the natural next question, and the natural next answer is "he wouldn't!" and so, no kids.</li>
<li>V2, L. 128 - Summing up the above: "When reasons have to be put forward at all in a question of life, life itself has become questionable."</li>
<li>V2, L. 194 - Linguistics nerdery: day-to-day talk is for peasants and lords (holders of temporal power), philosophical, literary language is for priests (holders of spiritual power), and "koines" - simplified common tongues spoken with foreigners, is for merchants and the bourgeoisie</li>
<li>V2, L. 203 - Here, Spengler maybe most confounds those who would consign him to some boring flavor of biological or linguistic determinist - he believes that a <i>people</i> (I assume this a translation of the German <i>folk</i>) is shaped by the deeds it does, and <i>not</i> the other way around. The Ostrogoths are known for what they were like <i>because</i> they conquered Spain, not the other way around. Americans are American because they sailed across a sea and came to a new continent. Sure, geographical, accidental, and other factors may shape what deeds a folk gets up to, but Spengler came down strongly on the side that what a folk <i>did</i> is what defined them.</li>
<li>V2, L. 224 - Spengler links the Faustian interest in genealogy with Darwinism - rather dismissively, as you might have guessed</li>
<li>V2, L. 232 - "<i>Lever doodt als Sklav</i> ('better dead than slave') is an old Frisian peasant-saying. The reverse has been the choice of every late Civilization, and every late Civilization has had to experience how much that choice cost it."</li>
<li>V2, L. 242 - "A religion that has got as far as taking social problems in hand has ceased to be a religion."</li>
<li>V2, L. 249 - Spengler thinks very local cults of religious practice were <i>only</i> a trait of the Classical Culture/Civilization, but I think this is nuts. <i>Every</i> culture used to worship in a highly local fashion, and many religions have ongoing practices that are super localized. Check out Shinto Shrines in Japan for one example.</li>
<li>V2, L. 251 - "Carefully as Syncretism has been examined in recent years, the clue to its development - the transformation fo Eastern Churches into Western cults, and then the reverse process of transformation fo Western cults into Eastern Churches - has been missed."</li>
<li>V2, L. 294 - An uncharacteristically pithy way of putting how Faustian, Classical, and Magian religious feelings are unalike: "Whereas the Faustian man is an 'I' that in the last resort draws its own conclusions about the Infinite; whereas the Apollonian man, as one <i>soma</i> among many, represents only himself; the Magian man, with his spiritual kind of being, is only a /part of a pneumatic 'We' that, descending from above, is one and the same in all believers."</li>
<li>V2, L. 320 - "The Neoplatonist monk Sarapion went into the desert in order to devote himself entirely to studying the hymns of Orpheus." - Sounds like someone who might have some good insights into polytheistic devotional work. Poking around online, it looks like he might only be briefly mentioned in the works of Porphyry, and that his name is more commonly rendered in English these days as Serapion (with an 'e').</li>
<li>V2, L. 351 - "This youthful inwardness proceeds always out of a townless countryside, out of villages, hovels, sanctuaries, solitary cloisters, and hermitages. Here is formed the community of high awareness, of the spiritual elect, which inwardly is separated by a whole world from the great being-currents of the heroic and the knightly." John Michael Greer, from whom I first learned about Spengler, speculates that today's American culture is not <i>truly</i> Faustian, but rather its own thing with a Faustian pseudomorphosis. He doesn't think a North American great Culture will arise for another few hundred years, but he thinks that there are hints of the world-feeling that will enliven it to be found if you look closely enough, as he talks about <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/america-and-russia-tamanous-and-sobornost/">here</a>. I wrote down this saying, as it might give a hint of where to look for more of these stirrings</li>
<li>V2, L. 356 - "Out of these last surviving traces, however, an outline of the Early Classical religion emerges bright and distinct. Just as all Gothic inwardness directed itself upon Mary, Queen of Heaven and Virgin and Mother, so in tha tmoment of the Classical World there arose a garland of myths, images, and figures around Demeter, the bearing mother, around Gaia and Persephone, and also Dionysus the begetter, chthonian and phallic cults, festivals and mysteries of birth and death. All this, too, was characteristically Classical, conceived under the aspect of present corporeality. The Apollonian religion venerated body, the Orphic rejected it, that of Demeter celebrated the moments of fertilization and birth, in which body acquired being. There was a mysticisim that reverently honoured the secret of life, in doctrine, symbol, and mime, but side by side with it there was orgiasm too, for the squandering of the body is as deeply and closely akin to asceticism as sacred prostitution is to celibacy - both, all, are negations of time. It is the reverse of the Apollonian "halt!" that checks on teh threshold of Hubris; detachment is not kept, but flung away. He who has experienced these things in his soul has 'from being a mortal become a god.' In those days there must have been great saints and seers who towered as far above the figures of Heraclitus and Empedocles as the latter above the iternerant teachers of Cynicism and Stoicism - things of this order do not happen namelessly and impersonally. As the songs of Achilles and Odysseus were dying down everywhere, a grand, strict doctrine arose at the famous old cult-places, a mysticism and scholasticism with developed educational methods and a secret oral tradition, as in India. But all that is buried, and the relics of the later times barely suffice to prove that it once existed."</li>
<li>V2, L. 380 - One of the core bits of the Faustian worldview is the symbol of "the Machine," which led both to literal, physical machines of great complexity and sophistication, but also, of course, the mechanical, dynamic worldview of scientific materialism</li>
<li>V2, L. 413-414 - Here, Spengler talks about how the two sexes experience and understand the world in unalike ways. It struck me as a good supplement to Jungian views of the masculine and the feminine.</li>
<li>V2, L. 422 - "There were no castes in the Old and Middle Kingdoms of Egypt, nor in India before Buddha, nor in China before Han times." At least in India, more recent genetic evidence suggests this might not be true, as the <i>Jatis</i> are <i>very</i> <a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2018/04/22/who-we-are-8-india/">genetically distinct</a>, suggesting thousands of years of pretty strict endogamy.</li>
<li>V2, L. 423 - "In the Carolingian pre-Culture men distinguished <i>Knechte</i> [vassals], <i>Freie</i> [free men], and <i>Edle</i> [nobles]." Spengler brings in some other Germanic early middle ages examples and argues that these are the status distinctions of an early great Culture, which may or may not be true, but which reminded me of some other sources that suggest way older roots. Georges Dumezil was a French scholar of comparative mythology and religion who put forward the highly influential theory that Proto-Indo-European society was split up into three "functions" - the priests/judges, the warriors, and productive folks (farmers, craftsmen, maybe merchants, and so forth). Likewise, the Old Norse <i>Rigsthula</i>, tells how the God "Rig" (most folks read Him as Heimdall) originated the three levels of society: thralls (slaves), free men, and jarls (nobles) when he spent the night with a mortal couple that hosted him.</li>
<li>V2, L. 427 - Spengler utterly contrasts the nobility with the priesthood, in terms of their experiences of life and how they come at the world-feeling or Soul Image of their culture. It led me to wonder how much of his view was shaped by how things are in Christianity, since in many Cultures, landholding warrior nobles also have important religious duties</li>
<li>V2, L. 435 - "Honour" as <i>the</i> heart of the "custom-ethic" of the nobility, which called to mind <i>Honor: A History</i> by James Bowman, which has done a lot to shape my thinking over the years.</li>
<li>V2, L. 440, Footmark 39 - "After death the teachers of error are excluded from the eternal bliss of the textbook and cast into the purgatorial fires of footnotes, whence, purged by the intercession of the believer, they ascend into the paradise of the paragraphs." Hah! Spengler does have a sense of humor, after all.</li>
<li>V2, L. 442 - Spengler felt like those who gave their life to some craft, even if they came together in guilds, and even if those guilds became <i>tribes</i>, thanks to strict rules of heredity, never made up a <i>class</i> the way that nobles, priests, and peasants truly did, as their defining feature is and always was some tangible <i>skill</i>, and not some feeling for "the way the world is." I think Spengler's maybe overly harsh on craftsmen, and again, overly snobbish, but it's an interesting point to consider, especially when set next to things like <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924050079718">The Guild State</a> by George Robert Taylor.</li>
<li>V2, L. 451 - "For it was a creative enthusiasm in the man of the city that from the tenth century B.C. (and 'contemporaneously' in other Cultures) drew generation after generation under the spell of a new life, with which there emerges for the first time in human history the idea of <i>freedom</i>. This idea is not of political (Still less of abstract) origin, but is something bringing to expression the fact that within the city walls plant-like attachment to a soil has ceased, and that the threads that run through the whole life of the countryside have been snapped. And consequently the freedom-idea ever contains a negative; it looses, redeems, defends, always frees a man <i>from</i> something. Of <i>this</i> freedom the city is the expression; the city-spirit is understanding become free, and everything in the way of in the way of intellectual, social, and national movements that bursts forth in Late periods under the name of Freedom leads back to an origin <i>in this one prime fact of detachment from the land</i>."</li>
<li>V2, L. 453 - "As components of the Third Estate, which counts by heads and not by rank, they are all, in all Late periods of all Cultures 'liberal' in one way or another - namely, free from the inward powers of non-urban life. Economy is freed to make money, science freed to criticize. And so in all the great decisions we perceive the intellect with its books and its meetings having the word ('Democracy'), and money obtaining the advantages ('Plutocracy') - and it is never ideas, but always capital, that wins. But this again is just the opposition of truths and facts, in the form in which it develops from teh city-life. Moreover, by way of protest against the ancient symbols of the soil-bound life, the city opposes to the aristocracy of birth the notion of an aristocracy of money and an aristocracy of intellect - the one not very explicit as a claim, but all the more effective as a fact; the other a truth, but nothing more than that and, as a spectacle for the eye, not very convincing."</li>
<li>V2, L. 463 - "To 'have the right' is an expression of power. This is a historical fact that every moment confirms, but it is not acknowledged in the realm of truth, which is not of this world. In their conceptions of right, therefore, as in other things, being and waking-being, Destiny and causality, stand implacably opposed. To the priestly and idealistic moral of good and evil belongs the <i>moral distinction of right and wrong</i>, but in the race-moral of good and bad the distinction is between those who give and those who receive the law. An abstract idea of justice pervades the minds and writings of all whose spirit is noble and strong and whose blood is weak, pervades all religions and all philosophies - but the fact-world of history knows only the <i>success</i> which turns the law of the stronger into the law of all." A somewhat rough way of thinking about things that I'm still wrestling with.</li>
<li>V2, L. 469 - "But in the historical world there are no ideals, but only facts - no truths, but only facts. There is no reason, no honesty, no equity, no final aim, but only facts, and anyone who does not realize this should write books on politics - let him not try to <i>make</i> politics. In the real world there are no states built according to ideals, but only states that have <i>grown</i>, and these are nothing but living peoples 'in form.' No doubt it is 'the form impressed that living doth itself unfold,' but the impress has been that of the blood and beat of a <i>being</i>, wholly instinctive and involuntary; and as to the unfolding, if it is guided by the master of politics, it takes the direction inherent in teh blood; if by the idealist, that dictated by his own convictions - in other words, the way to nullity." I can't settle whether I think this is a helpfully clear-eyed splash of cold water on high-flying idealism, or hopelessly cynical nihilism.</li>
<li>V2, L. 486, FM 51 - The "Blues" and the "Greens" of Byzantium, ostensibly fans of rival chariot racing teams, are often used as examples of utterly arbitrary, ridiculous tribalism/partisanship, but Spengler says that claiming they were "only" about the Circus teams is flat out wrong, instead, these were thinly-veiled parties of class interest, more like the Ghibellines and the Guelphs or the Optimates and Populares.</li>
<li>V2, L. 487 - "And thus, at the close of the early periods of both these Cultures, we see two principles parallel and contrasted, the Faustian-genealogical and the Apollonian-oligarchic; two kinds of constitutional la, of Dike. The one is supported by an unmeasured sense of expanse, reaches back deep into the past with form-tradition, thinks forward with the same intense will-to-endure into the remotest future; but in the present, too, works for political effectiveness over broad expanses by well-considered dynastic marriages and by the truly Faustian, dynamic, and contrapuntal politics that we call <i>diplomacy</i>. The other, wholly corporeal and statuesque, is self-limited by its policy of <i>autarkeia</i> to the nearest and the most immediate present, and at every point stoutly denies that which Western being affirms." Conceptually, like Taleb, I'm a fan of City States as a model of government that seems to strike the right balance between collective will and power with limited scope and lots of variation, but Spengler thinks that the West is constitutionally unsuited to City States.</li>
<li>V2, L. 491, FM 64 - Spengler points out that today's Western law is defined by <i>territory</i>, whereas Classical law was defined by <i>citizenship</i>. To put it another way, in Italy today, Italian law applies to everyone in the country, but 2,000 years ago, Roman law applied to every Roman, wherever he was in the world, and <i>not to anyone else in Italy</i> (at least the rights of the law, you could still be sued, of course)</li>
<li>V2, L. 531 - Spengler believes that the West is uniquely suited to mass-printing, and therefore mass literacy, which sounds great, but also makes it uniquely suited to ideologies and other abstraction-based movements</li>
<li>V2, L. 563 - Spengler dismisses philosophizing about politics as useless and hiding from us what we might learn by observing the actual facts of politics, and as usual, I think he has a point, but also as with many of his thoughts, I think he's a bit <i>too</i> sweeping in claiming there's <i>no</i> value in applying abstract thinking to politics.</li>
<li>V2, L. 564 - Speaking of politics, here's a maybe useful way to think about it: "The being-streams of humanity are called History when we regard them as movement, and family, estate, people, nation, when we regard them as the object moved. Politics is the way in which this fluent Being maintains itself, <i>grows</i>, triumphs over other life-streams."</li>
<li>V2, L. 567 - "The born statesman is above all a valuer - a valuer of men, situations, and things. He has the 'eye' which unhesitatingly and inflexibly embraces the round of possibilities. The judge of horses takes in an animal with one glance ad knows what prospects it will have in a race. To do the correct thing without 'knowing' it, to have the hands that imperceptibly tighten or ease the bit - his talent is the very opposite to that of the man of theory." For me, this calls to mind Clausewitz's discussion of the "commander's eye," which is the ability for a military commander to look at and instantly comprehend a situation and what needs to be done about it.</li>
<li>V2, L. 570-571 - Spengler talks about how it's hard enough to do something great on your own, but it's <i>way</i> harder to build a tradition that consistently delivers men capable of great things - <i>that</i> is what a Culture is in its prime. The thing is, tradition, by its nature, eliminates the unique. So instead of a handful of truly great men, you get a large body or pretty good men. As Spengler put it "not a Caesar, but the Senate." This might be why you start seeing great men appear on the scene when these traditions <i>stop</i> so consistently producing fairly-high-excellence and become crappy. The wiggle room opened up is what naturally talented and ambitious men can use to do more than the tradition would have let them.</li>
<li>V2, L. 577 - "But always it is the Non-Estate, the unit of protest against the essence of Estate, whose leading minority - 'educated' and 'well-to-do' - comes forward as a party with a program, consisting of aims that are not felt but defined, and of the rejection of everything that cannot be rationally grasped. <i>At bottom, therefore, there is only one party</i>, that of the bourgeoisie, the liberal, and it is perfectly conscious of its position as such. It looks on itself as coextensive with 'the people.' Its opponents (above all, the genuine Estates - namely, 'squire and parson') are enemies and traitors to 'the people,' and its opinions are the 'voice of the people' - which is inoculated by all the expedients of party-political nursing, oratory in the Forum, press in teh West, until these opinions do fairly represent it."</li>
<li>V2, L. 580 - "An Estate has instincts, a party has a program, but a following has a master."</li>
<li>V2, L. 593 - "Today we live so cowed under the bombardment of this intellectual artillery that hardly anyone can attain to the inward detachment that is required for a clear view of the monstrous drama. The will-to-power operating under a pure democratic disguise has finished off its masterpiece so well that the object's sense of freedom is actually flatered by the most thorough-going enslavement that has ever existed. The liberal bourgeois mind is <i>proud</i> of the abolition of censorship, the last restraint, while the dictator of the press - Northcliffe! - keeps the slave-gang of his readers under the whip of his leading articles, telegrams, and pictures. <i>Democracy has by its newspaper completely expelled the book from the mental life of the people</i>. The book-world, with its profusion of standpoints that compelled thought to select and criticize, is now a real possession only for a few. The people reads the <i>one</i> paper, 'its' paper, which forces itself through the front doors by millions daily, spellbinds the intellect from morning to night, drives the book into oblivion by its more engaging layout, and if one or another specimen of a book does emerge into visibility, forestalls and eliminates its possible effects by 'reviewing' it." Am I a part of this process by writing these posts? Hmmm. Also, just imagine how he'd feel about social media!</li>
<li>V2, L. 594-595 - Just as widespread literacy makes folks more susceptible to abstraction-based ideologies and politics, once folks get used to getting their political thoughts from media, it's not a big jump for a single person to start sharing what he wants folks to do through that media, meaning that widespread literacy/access to information actually makes it <i>easier</i> for a caesar to arise. Ouch.</li>
<li>V2, L. 599 - Spengler sees the industrial economy for the historical aberration it is, which is hard enough to do today, but must have been nearly impossible in his time, when it was still on the ascendant</li>
<li>V2, L. 605 - Once again, Spengler contrasts the fields of Fact (like economics and politics) and the fields of Truth (like religion and philosophy) and how they are ultimately irreconcilable. Once again, I think he has good insight, but is overly strong. It also came to me that polytheism might help with some of these contradictions - not every "higher truth" has to be a <i>universal</i> higher truth - maybe some things really are transcendent realities of one kind or another, but their applicability is only to a given place, time, or folk?</li>
<li>V2, L. 607 - Spengler points out how in early Cultures, trade and war are intrinsically linked - they're both about getting stuff to bring back home, it's only the tactics that differ. This meshes with what we know about how Vikings worked - if it seemed easier/less risky/more profitable to trade, they'd trade, but if it seemed like they could just take what they wanted, they'd do that. This gave me a bit of insight into why the Romans might have identified Woden as "Mercury" - for the Germanish folks wandering into the Empire, trade and war were likely still obviously linked, and so when the Romans talked about a God of trade and exchange, they must have been like "oh yeah, we've got a God for that too"</li>
<li>V2, L. 622 - Spengler talks about how different Cultures have different flavors of "money thinking" - they literally see money in different ways and therefore seek and use it differently. I wonder if anyone else has picked up on this, as it might be rather interesting. At least to me, since I have a bit of a thing for the history and nature of money. So far, my favorite work on its history is <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out</a> by Nick Szabo, but that is pretty much the opposite to what Spengler is talking about, since he argues for the universal qualities of what makes money "money."</li>

<p>
Looking over my notes for these two fat tomes, I think we are coming close to
the end of my posts on <i>Decline of the West</i>. I'm thinking after this post, I'll
do one more with a "grab bag" of thoughts, sayings, and other bits that jumped
out at me and seem worth sharing, but that aren't drawn together by a lone
thread the way posts up until this one have been. Of course, if you're hopping
up and down yelling about something weighty I missed, by all means let me know,
and who's to say we won't come back to Spengler sometime down the road? As I
said, there's <i>a lot</i> in those books.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org002f813" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org002f813">Ages of Reason - "We Will Understand Everything!"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org002f813">
<p>
As every Culture goes about its development, it finds that its own world-feeling
brings it insights into how the world works that no other Culture has had. Drawn
on by the intoxicating aroma of intellectual breakthroughs, it starts to see the
patterns in the insights of its thinkers and as a group, they work out an
overall framework for understanding the world based on these patterns. Early on,
such work has great drive and high hopes - "we'll understand the world and how
it works down to the deepest groundings!" Here in those Cultures shaped by the
Faustian, we are most familiar with one flavor of this: "the Enlightenment."
When the Royal Society and friends got going, they had very high hopes that
hidden underpinnings of the world would be made clear, and that we would come to
<i>finally</i> understand the world the way it "really" is. Many folks still hold out
hope that the scientific method will bring this about, but the, erm,
embarrassing fact that major physics breakthroughs stopped happening nearly a
hundred years ago is making itself harder and harder to ignore.
</p>

<p>
The thing is, looking backward and farther afield, we can see that ours is not
the first Culture to find an intellectual tool of great might, wield it against
every conceivable problem, and become convinced that it is the end-all, be-all
of intellectual investigation. The Apollonian Culture worked out formal reason
and thought that everything worth knowing could be worked out with it. The
Magian Culture came up with Algebra and linked ways of turning hard problems
into numbers, as well as the thought of "variables" - numbers whose value you
didn't know, but about which you could make reasonable statements. The Chinese
Culture, focused as it always has been on how folks get along in the world,
turned its Age of Reason on human interactions and politics, coming up with some
of the most systematic understandings of human behavior ever written down. As I
said above, the crowning achievement of Faustian Reason is, of course, the
Scientific Method, and its bleeding edge is those fields of science that require
analytical mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Now, this is one of the stronger arguments I have for why Spengler is wrong in
his contention that <i>nothing</i> truly gets carried over from one culture to
another - modern computing would never have happened without an attempt to put
together formal logic with algebraic variables in an effort to more readily
solve analytic math problems (check out Babbage's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a> sometime).
If you've learned that "if p, then q does not necessarily imply if not p, then
not q," then you are an heir to the height of the Classical age of reason. Hell,
if you've learned that a triangle's angles must add up to 180 degrees, then you
are too. Likewise with algebra and Magian civilization. I think it very likely
that the great Cultures of the years to come will make use of the scientific
method and calculus, without the Faustian assumption that these ways and these
alone will throw open the veils of nature's mysteries.
</p>

<p>
As I said above, all of these systems are <i>very good</i> at unriddling the hidden
truths of the world. Unluckily, none of them can unriddle <i>every</i> hidden truth of
the world. Each Culture has its own unique way of seeing the world, and uses
that to see things that no other Culture has yet. But just as that point of view
brings insight, it also brings blind spots. Systems of Reason are systems of
<i>abstraction</i>, and no abstraction can handle every nuance. In fact, as these
systems of abstraction build, they tend to turn inward upon themselves -
abstractions about abstractions and so on, ad nauseam. It turns out the world is
a big, weird place, and the little lumps of wet electric meat we use to make
sense of it can only go so far. Which means that after a long enough time of
using this shiny new hammer to treat every mystery as a nail, Cultures start to
work out that their given way of understanding the world rationally doesn't
deliver on its promise to replace the certainty once given by religious thought
and feeling. Systems of reason tear apart the old sources of meaning with the
promise that they will find greater meaning on the other side of the carnage,
but then never deliver on that promise. And so, as Cultures transition into
Civilizations, they find themselves needing to get back in touch with meaning.
Which brings us to the "Second Religiousness."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1f800a5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1f800a5">The Second Religiousness - "Actually, We Need Meaning Again"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1f800a5">
<p>
Spengler argues that as a Culture turns into a Civilization, one of the many
threads of exhaustion and ennui that adds to the loss of Cultural vigor is that
the Age of Reason fails to live up to its early high hopes. It turns out that
you <i>can't</i> work everything out logically if you're just careful enough about
premises. Nor can variables capture <i>all</i> of the complexity of our messy world.
And, these days, it seems that not even the scientific method can unravel every
last mystery - physics has stalled out since at least the 70s, and attempts at
grand, unifying theories have been found&#x2026; wanting. Unluckily, along the way,
systems of Reason tend to wholly dismantle the faith that gave meaning before
their rise. And so, when the methods of Reason start to falter, the folk of that
Civilization find themselves face-to-face with the big, scary world, and every
way of making it have meaning has been found wanting in one way or another. And
so, the folks of the Civilization turn their hearts and minds back toward what
once brought meaning - the spiritual yearnings of the original "World-Feeling"
that underlies their Culture's "Soul Image" that we already <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_3_the_soul_image">talked about</a>.
</p>

<p>
Coming back to this sense of "what the world is like" that was there at the dawn
of the Culture, but now in a powerful Civilization that has interacted with, or
even subjugated, very unalike cultures, this "Second Religiousness" tends to be
syncretic in nature. It pieces together the images, stories, and symbolism of
widely varied Cultures into a way of describing the Civilization's most deeply
felt sense of the world. In other words, to use a recent pop culture reference,
you get a "reboot" of the same original spiritual conception, but using the
symbolic, philosophical, and literary furniture of a more cosmopolitan age. The
mashup of Taoism, Buddhism, Animism, and Ancestor Worship that became "Chinese
Traditional Religion," the blend of Greek philosophy, Egyptian Magic, and Middle
Eastern rites that was late Classical paganism, and so forth. It's impossible to
predict <i>exactly</i> what shape the Second Religiousness will take ahead of time, but
you can guess at some of what it will be like. The first stirrings of this trend
come when the Civilization is still feeling its worldly strength (such as the
Augustan age in Rome), but when hindsight will show it has passed its peak.
</p>

<p>
Some say that here in the West, we're starting to see the first signs of the
Second Religiousness with things like Tradcaths and the growing interest in
Orthodox Christianity. It's hard to say, since these things are best identified
with hindsight, but whatever shape it takes, it will likely be something that
speaks to whatever Gothic Catholicism did, but in a new way, bringing in
elements from around the world. Maybe it will be a Buddhism with communion and
yoga, or Christianity with Orisha and Stoic Ethics. Again, we can't say ahead of
time, but it's very likely that as science keeps on showing itself inadequate to
answer the deepest questions of meaning, we will see more and more folks turn
(back) to religion, whatever shape it takes. Given my own interests, I'm very
curious to see what happens in my lifetime.

<h3 id="org030fc74">Wrapping Up</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org030fc74">
<p>
As I said at the top, right now, I'm thinking one more post on some of the
grabby thoughts from the books that didn't <i>quite</i> have enough meat on the bone
for whole posts, but there's always more to dig into here, most of all if/when I
get to reading some other Cyclical History thinkers, like Vico or Toynbee. For
now, though, I hope these posts have helped you understand Spengler, or at least
to know what folks are on about when they bring him up. If not, do let me know,
and I'll do what I can to make them better.

<p>
We've now gone over what I believe to be the weightiest things to take away from
<i>Decline of the West</i>: looking at history and cultures <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">morphologically</a>, thinking
about cultures as if they are <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">living thing</a>, and the thought that each culture is
defined by its <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_3_the_soul_image">"Soul Image"</a>. I thought about wrapping up this series there, but
these two weighty tomes have a <i>lot</i> of stuff to them, and I think there's a few
more things worth getting from the books. I'm working these posts out as I go,
so I'm not sure how many more we'll have, but for today, at least, we've got
more Spengler to dive into. This time we're going to talk about two key
distinctions he makes throughout the book and the general idea that underlies
both of them: time versus destiny, and space versus motion. With these, Spengler
gets darn near <i>metaphysical</i>, so let's dig in.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org65e3c69" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org65e3c69">Time and Destiny - What Happened against What to Do</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org65e3c69">
<p>
Spengler talks often about the difference between "time" and "destiny." This is
one of those steads where he speaks very emphatically and kind of assumes you
know what he means, but he mostly just gestures at examples of the distinction
and says "see? This what I'm talking about." The best way I can think to put it
is that time is what you perceive when you look back over events and make sense
of what happened when, whereas destiny is the feeling of being in the moment or
looking ahead and being aware that things change. Time is the purview of the
historian, the dry content of stories of what came before. Destiny is the
purview of the man of action - it's the feeling that things will not last, that
you can change their course, and the world might be some other way than what it
is now. Spengler talks about how folks of different classes tend to feel more of
one or more of the other, but also how during different phases of a Culture's
lifecycle, one way or the other tends to be more widespread. Time is farthest
from Destiny when it is treated as a measurable quantity, merely one more kind
of distance.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Spengler argues that the very idea of "cause and effect" is an artifact
of a rationalizing/systematizing way of looking at Time. You can only clearly
identify cause and effect <i>after</i> the event, as you think about what happened as a
sequence of episodes, rather than the fluid, organic flow of one thing happening
into another. Now, obviously, Spengler doesn't mean that you can't take an
action because you know or suspect what outcome it will bring, but this is from
past experience. To the degree that it's automatic (you move your hand to where
the ball will be to catch it), you're not really thinking in terms of cause and
effect - you have a goal and you do what you need to do to get it. You don't
have to understand the ballistics of the ball mathematically to do that. On the
other hand, if you <i>are</i> reasoning about cause and effect consciously, in advance,
you're really doing two things, both of which are backward-looking. First, you
are drawing on facts about the world that you know, whether from experience,
book learning, or whatever, and comparing them to this situation. Secondly, you
are imagining the end state and then asking "what would it take for me to be
there instead of here?" So you are looking backward in your imagination.
</p>

<p>
Let's get <i>real</i> weird and mix our Spengler with a little pop culture. This
example is <i>perfect</i>, but you may or may not know it. In the surprisingly-great
cartoon show <i>Gravity Falls</i>, one of the main characters, a 12 year old boy named
Dipper, has an enormous crush on a cool older girl, Wendy. There's a party at
the funky tourist trap they both work at (Dipper's uncle runs the place is why
he's working as a 12 year old). Dipper, being the nerdy reasoning type comes up
with a plan with literal numbered steps about how he will talk to Wendy and get
her to like him. The show being what it is, this leads to hilarious paranormal
hijinks, and of course this ridiculous plan doesn't work, but in the midst of
it, Dipper runs into Wendy while they're both waiting to go to the bathroom, and
they just talk, and it goes great. When Dipper tried to plan every step, to know
what would happen in what sequence and how long it would take, he was dealing
with <i>Time</i>. When he just got out of his own way and acted like a normal human
with the flesh and blood girl in front of him, he was dealing with <i>Destiny</i>
</p>

<p>
So, to bring it back to Spengler, he believed that early in a Culture's
lifecycle, it is more caught up with Destiny, and less worried about Time.
Later, during the Civilization phases, Time comes to dominate. I should likely
stress that Spengler doesn't say that either is <i>better</i>, though you always kind
of get the impression he finds Destiny more appealing and mourns living in an
age where no one can avoid thinking more about Time than Destiny. He also felt
that men concerned with Life (the capital L is in the text), with shaping the
world to their will, tend to feel Destiny more keenly, whereas eggheads, bean
counters, and scribblers (thinkers, merchants, and writers) tend to see the
world through the lens of Time.

<h3 id="org592a4e6">Space and Motion - Where to Move Through against What Even Is "Moving"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org592a4e6">
<p>
Okay, I've got to come clean here - this one has been tough for me to get my
head around, and I'm not wholly sure I'm there yet. Spengler believed that a
Culture's <i>Depth-Feeling</i>, the way it experienced the physical space around it,
and the fact that some things are closer and some things are farther, was one of
the main drivers of their <i>World-Feeling</i>, which is expressed by the <i>Soul-Image</i> we
talked about last time. He says that the Faustian obsession with far-off point
on the horizon, always visible, always receding, comes from the experience of
both mighty, towering trees in the forests of northern and western Europe, and
also from the plains of central Europe. The obsession with what is <i>right here</i>
that I can <i>touch</i> held by the Apollonian culture was born of tiny islands and a
craggy peninsula, where your entire life might be lived in a physical space that
you can see all of from most vantage points. The Magian "great dome" is rooted
in the experience of the roof of stars in piercing brilliance stretched over the
clear, desert night.
</p>

<p>
In other words, Spengler believed that different Cultures <i>feel</i> "space" very
differently, and that the way folks in the modern West think of "space" is very
much shaped by the Faustian Depth- and World-Feelings, and our understanding of
"motion" even more so (more on that in a moment). The way that we think of
"space" as a fixed, abstract dimension, as if we are moving around in a
three-axis Cartesian plot with coordinates around an origin, is <i>deeply</i> rooted in
how Faustian culture experiences the world around it. Scholars of the Apollonian
Culture would likely have found such thoughts strange. Artistically, Western
culture is the <i>only one ever</i> to come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">linear vanishing-point perspective</a>,
because to Renaissance artists (firmly Faustian in Spengler's mind, fooling
themselves about how "Classical" they were), that was just "how the world
looked", but to artists from other cultures is just <i>did not</i> look that way, or to
whatever degree it did, that was not what was <i>important</i> to represent
two-dimensionally.
</p>

<p>
Now, if Motion is understood as objects changing location in Space, then you can
see that how a Culture sees Space can't help but shape its understanding of
Motion. Newton's expression of Motion as forces acting upon mass in space
obviously has a lot to recommend it - look at what the West has done with this
model! But it turns out that "force" is kind of a weird, tricky idea to actually
pin down, and a bunch of physicists since have tried to find ways of
understanding motion that don't require it. Spengler says that Newton was
expressing some pretty fundamental ideas about what the world is and how it
works that were deeply rooted in the Faustian psyche. I'm not gonna lie to you,
Marge: I don't wholly get what Spengler means here, so let's let the man speak
for himself:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Newton, a deeply religious nature, was only bringing the Faustian world-feeling
to expression when, to elucidate the words "force" and "motion," he said that
masses are points of attack for force and carriers for motion. So the
thirteenth-century Mystics had conceived of God and his relation to world.
Newton no doubt rejected the metaphysical element in his famous saying
"<i>hypotheses non fingo</i> [I contrive no hypotheses]," but all the same he was
metaphysical through and through in the founding of his mechanics. <i>Force is the
mechanical Natures-picture of Western man; what Will is to his soul-picture and
infinite Godhead in his world-picture</i>. The primary ideas of this physics stood
firm long before the first physicist was born, for they lay in the earliest
religious world-consciousness of our Culture.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Spengler, O. (2020). <i>Decline of the West, Volume I: Form and Actuality</i>. Arktos.

</p>

<p>
Right now, my main takeaway is that when you are living in Destiny, rather than
time, you don't really give much heed to "motion" as a <i>thing</i> - you just notice
what the moving things around you are doing and what it means to you (grab this,
dodge that, dance with her, run from him, and so forth). When you stop and try
to work out what's "really" happening there, you have to have some sense of
Space as a thing that can be measured, and Time as a thing that can be measured,
and those are both deeply rooted in your Culture's worldview, so the science
your culture invents will be shaped by those, likely at a way-down-deep level
where you don't even notice it. In the same chapter that the above quote is
from, Spengler argues that a Culture's "Nature-knowing" (what we call science
these days) thinks that it is an objective study of what's "out there," but that
it might be better understood as an extremely sophisticated way for a culture to
come to understand itself.

<h3 id="orgcefa487">Closing - What to Do With These Thoughts?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcefa487">
<p>
As you can see, these thoughts are maybe less <i>directly</i> helpful in making sense
of the world than the big ones we've touched on in earlier posts. That being
said, if you <i>are</i> intrigued by Spengler's way of looking at the world and you'd
like to apply some of his tools, these are where we start to get specific enough
to start doing some original analysis. Say you want a "Spenglerian" take on a
Culture he doesn't get much into, like the pre-Columbian Mesoamericans, or
China, or India. Here's where to start - what kind of Destiny called its men of
action to do their great deeds? How did its natural philosophers come to think
about Time? What Depth-Feeling shaped their sense of Space? How did they
conceive of objects moving through that Space?
</p>

<p>
The other big thing that is helpful about these thoughts is that they make <i>very</i>
clear that the things we take for granted, stuff that we assume are "objective
facts about the universe" are, instead, models. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22">"The Map is Not the Territory."</a>
<i>Every</i> understanding of the world involves some amount of abstraction - taking
heed of some things about the world and leaving others out. The world is too big
and weird for us to do otherwise. Spengler gives a wealth of examples to really
disabuse you of the likely lingering feeling that "yeah, okay, I know, they're
all models, but this one is <i>basically</i> how it really is, right?"
</p>

<p>
As I said many times above, I'm not wholly happy with my understanding of these
thoughts, so we may come back to them, and I'd welcome any thoughts, add-ons, or
fixes.

<p>
Okay, so last time I put forth that Spengler's thought that Cultures are best
looked at as living beings that have a common lifecycle that can be found out by
looking at many cultures morphologically was the single biggest and most helpful
thought in these big, fat books. Today, I want to talk about what comes in a
very close second - the "Soul Image" (though Spengler talks about the same thing
in a few ways throughout the books, this is the term in the Table of Contents,
and so I'm treating it as the "most official." No idea what words he uses in
German for the same thought). If the thought behind <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">Culture as Organism</a> is to
look at the ways in which Cultures across time and space are <i>alike</i>, the Soul
Image is meant to tell us the ways that they are <i>unalike</i>. This might be
Spengler's <i>most</i> touchy-feely, qualitative, hard-to-prove, easy-to-argue concept
in his whole mighty tome, but it is also the beating heart of said tome. You
either run into this idea and go "oh wow, yeah, that is so right!" or else you
recoil from it as unprovable, judgmental hogwash. Sounds fun, right? Let's jump
in.
</p>

<p>
Spengler believed that what made a Great Culture a Great Culture was that the
folks who made it up had some deeply felt sense about what the world is like and
what someone alive in it ought to do about that. He further believed that this
sense was shaped by the lands that gave rise to these Cultures - an Egyptian
tending his fields after the yearly flood of the Nile has enriched them is going
to understand the world and its workings rather unlike the way that a German
peasant who had to cut his field out of a deep, dark, and gnarly wood is going
to, and neither of them will much see the world like a Mongolian herder rounding
up his sheep on the vast steppe. The land, the turnings of the year, the
weather, the plants and beasts that make up the background to life will all lead
to folks thinking about the world and what it's like in ways that don't look
much like each other. How do we know? Well, take a look at the art they make,
the buildings they build, the music they make, and so forth. In other words,
look at their <i>culture</i>, in the sense that the word meant before the
anthropologists got a hold of it and gave it a broader and more universal
meaning. Spengler had no truck with that - to him, "primitive" people didn't
have "culture" - that was reserved for the folks who went out and did <i>great</i>
things and made <i>art</i>. I never said the guy wasn't a snob, but he was at least a
very well-trained snob.
</p>

<p>
Okay, this is all rather abstract, so let's try to look at some of the Soul
Images Spengler talks about. For the Classical or Apollonian Culture (Greeks and
Romans), the Soul Image was the perfect human body, right <i>here</i>, defined
tangible, in a particular place. For the Middle Eastern or Magian (from ~200-100
BCE or so), it is sitting within a great dome, whether a cave, the roof of a
tent, or the night sky in the desert, placed there by an all-powerful and
personally involved creator. For the Western or Faustian Culture (European from
~500 CE), the Soul Image is the idea of chasing an ever-receding point in
infinite space - the distant goal on the horizon or the point where all the
trees in the forest seem to come together in the sky. Spengler speaks a bit
about the Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, and Mesoamerican Soul Images, but he knew
these Cultures and their histories less well and they had less direct bearing on
his Europe and where it might be going. His thought is that each of these Soul
Images is the deeply felt sense of something deep and weighty, something that
stirs the soul, but that is ever so hard to truly say or show someone - that's
why it takes a Culture over a thousand years to wear out the artistic,
architectural, and philosophical possibilities of that Soul Image and settle
into rehashing what has come before during the Civilization bit of the
lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
Spengler believed that someone from a given Culture could not help but see the
world through its Soul Image, and on the flip side, could not <i>truly</i> understand
how folks from another Culture saw the world or what their Soul Image was all
about. Oh sure, you could come to understand it intellectually, but it would
never be deeply <i>felt</i> as "just how things are" the way it would be for a native
of the culture. A crude analogy from my own experience: if you are a Millenial
or a Gen Xer, chances are pretty good that you marked the coming of Anime to the
United States. In the 80s, a handful of deeply weird and often very bloody films
found their way into odd pockets of US popular culture, and a few more shows
were carefully localized and cleaned up for American audiences and presented
without their Japaneseness being highlighted (like <i>Robotech</i>). In the 90s, this
picked up a bit, and you started finding American folks who were into "Anime" as
a genre/subculture/fandom/whatever - my cool older friend showed me a fan sub of
<i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i> that his college Anime Club had put together
when he was home for the summer. By the early 2000's, the makers of mainstream
American animation had recognized a hot fad and wanted to get in on the action.
The result was a stream of American-made cartoons that sloppily and awkwardly
aped not only the visual style of Anime (which was itself a Japanese
re-interpretation of Disney animation, originally), but also attempted to bring
in bits of Japanese culture or tropes (like the giant sweat drop in frame to
show a character's embarrassment, or a guy getting a nosebleed because he's so
turned on by a girl). The worst were the attempts to copy Japanese humor. The
Americans making this stuff <i>kinda-sorta</i> understood what anime was doing, and
they recognized something appealing, but they did not <i>grok it in fullness</i>, and
the results were often cringeworthy. By the 2010s, most folks involved in and
interested in animation had worked out ways to take the stuff from anime that
was most amenable to American culture and more smoothly incorporate it, and you
didn't get as much stuff faking being Japanese.
</p>

<p>
Maybe this example doesn't resonate with you, but I'm sure that you can think of
examples of (popular) culture where folks from one Culture have tried to imitate
an artform, trope, style, or way of being from another Culture, and the results
have been hilariously <i>off</i>. Spengler called such attempts to adopt the Soul Image
of another Culture <i>pseudomorphosis</i>. The term comes from geology. Imagine a
formation of limestone surrounded by another, harder rock. Over time, the
limestone is eroded away by water, leaving a limestone-shaped and textured
hollow. Then, some magma flows into this space and fills it like metal cast into
a mold. You now have a formation that has the outward appearance of limestone,
but the composition of an igneous rock. This is an igneous rock that has
undergone a <i>pseudomorphosis</i>, which is Greek for "false shaping." Spengler makes
<i>much</i> use of this metaphor in understanding history and to explain why the
Cultures he sees, and the lifecycle he propounds for them, have not been more
obvious to others. Spengler saw pseudomorphosis when a Culture (usually younger
and with less worldly power) runs into another Culture and for one reason or
another tries to adopt artistic, architectural, or intellectual styles from the
other Culture, but in the process, can't help but apply its own Soul Image.
</p>

<p>
One of Spengler's more provocative assertions is that the usual understanding of
"Western Culture" is mistaken, and is, in fact, a series of successive Cultures
given a false sense of continuity through pseudomorphoses. You had the
Classical/Apollonian Culture, which hardened into a Civilization by the
Hellenistic era, meaning that most of what we remember about Rome was also in
the Civilization phase, then as that Civilization was crumbling, the young,
vigorous Middle Eastern/Magian Culture took on a Classical pseudomorphosis,
giving us "Late Antiquity," the early Christian Church, and the Byzantine
Empire. And lastly, the Magian-wearing-Classical-Clothes church then provided a
pseudomorphosis for the aborning Western/Faustian culture in the late Dark
Ages/Early Medieval period, with a more conscious and direct Classical
pseudomorphosis in the Renaissance. In other words, the great continuity of the
"Western Canon" taught in universities until rather recently, from Homer through
Faulkner, was seen by Spengler as glossing over real and important transitions
and changes in worldview.
</p>

<p>
As I said near the top of this post, Spengler's argument rests on a lot of
subjective, qualitative judgment, which many folks immediately take as
"therefore not valid." But heimjunge built those subjective, qualitative
judgments on a <i>lot</i> of knowledge of the Culture(s) at hand, and so it's worth at
least taking the assertion seriously as a point to consider. One example of what
I mean that's relevant to some of the other interests I blog about: the
"Neoplatonists" like Plotinus and Iamblichus were philosophers/religious figures
of the 3rd Century CE. Most historians see these as straightforwardly
late-Classical members of the Hellenistic world, heirs to the clearly Classical
Plato that their name implies. Not so Señor Spengler. He says that if you
actually read what Neoplatonists believed, it seems to have a lot more in common
with the mostly-monotheistic beliefs of the Middle Eastern/Magian world, and
shares their concern with spelled-out ethical systems, rather than the Classical
focus on the individual and his excellence. In other words, Spengler argues that
the Neoplatonists are <i>truly</i> Magian, but undergoing a Classical pseudomorphosis.
Likewise, most folks see the Christian Church as an element of continuity
between the late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. Spengler instead points out
how <i>very</i> unalike the faith of the Desert Fathers with its asceticism and strict
monotheism was from medieval Catholicism with its panoply of saints and great
focus on Mary - again, he sees European Catholicism as a Faustian religious
expression under a Magian pseudomorphosis.
</p>

<p>
I find the idea of pseudomorphosis, along with the foundational idea that
different cultures <i>really are</i> deeply different, a helpful one, but I don't take
it quite as far as Spengler did. Splengler thought that folks from different
cultures could never <i>truly</i> understand the world in the same way, and that when
one Culture took something from another, it was only ever a shallow imitation.
To his mind, the Hagia Sophia was <i>truly</i> Magian and the fact that it borrowed
Classical architecture was a diminishment or misdirection of that underlying
Soul Image. Likewise the cathedrals of Europe - to the degree that they used
Classical or Magian models, they were obfuscating the Faustian spirit trying to
express itself through them. To some degree, I'm sure that Spengler was
overreacting to the default position of absolute continuity from (at least)
Greece through to the modern West that was popular in his day. He also might
have been overstating his case either for rhetorical effect, or from the usual
attachment we form with our best-loved ideas. Whatever the case, I think
Spengler took too hard of a line.
</p>

<p>
I think the true picture is more complicated (and more interesting). For one
thing, there are some elements of <i>deep</i> cultural continuity that we know about -
for example, did you know that some fairy tales go back to at least the ice age?
Or how about the fact that until very recently, anywhere from Ireland to India,
it was assumed that a woman would take her husband's name when they got
married - that has its roots in proto-Indo-European cultural practice. So, for
Spengler to argue that <i>everything</i> the West got from the Apollonian or Magian
cultures was "false" in some sense strikes me as far fetched. The Neoplatonism
mentioned above comes to mind - though surely we understand it differently today
than did Plotinus, and he was likely farther from Plato than he might have
thought, there's a common thread of understanding the world uniting nearly 2500
years of thinkers, and that's pretty cool.

<p>
<a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">Last time</a>, we talked about Spengler's use of <i>morphology</i> to understand history and identify parallels between different Cultures at different times. Today, I'd like to talk about why he chose a biological metaphor and what he got from it. Maybe <i>the</i> key takeaway from <i>The Decline of the West</i> is the thought that Great Cultures/Civilizations are best thought of as <i>living things</i> that are born, grow up, show certain hallmarks, and after some time, grow old and die - just like you, me, and every other man, beast, and plant on earth. I don't know whether Spengler had the insight that Cultures are like living things and so pulled out the morphology, or if his use of the morphological way of understanding things led him to the thought that Cultures are best seen as living things. Either way, the two thoughts are very closely linked, and so I had some trouble working out which to speak to first, or even whether they ought to be two posts of their own, or put together into one. As you can clearly see, I went with two posts of their own, with "morphology" coming first, and now onto the lifecycle of Cultures. I thought that the lifecycle would be easier to talk about if we had the shared understanding of morphology that the last post hopefully brought about, and so now here we are.

First off, a bit of terminology that might be confusing if you have bumped into Spengler's thoughts, but not read his book. He talks about Cultures and Civilizations (the capital letters are used to make it clear we're talking about a specific concept here). I have heard that the German words <i>Kultur</i> and <i>Zivilisation</i> might have connotations closer to what Spengler meant in his work, but I don't speak German, and so I can't quite say. Instead, let me explain what I understand from the translation. When Spengler speaks of a "Culture," he does not mean just some group of folks with a shared way of being in the world, the way your Cultural Anthropology professor might. Instead, he means a group of folks with a <i>very particular</i> insight into the world (a "World Image," which we'll talk about more next time), that are in the midst of doing great things to explore that insight and try to make it manifest through art, writing, politics, and ways of living - everything that a modern English speaker would call (note the little 'c') "culture." A "Civilization," on the other hand, is what a Culture <i>turns into</i> when it has exhausted itself in exploring its particular way of looking at the world and instead just uses that way of looking at the world to get material things done, like conquering other folks who don't have their stuff quite as together. In Spengler's way of looking at things, Cultures are young, vibrant, alive, messy, and creative. Civilizations, on the other hand, are old, stodgy, dead, orderly, and derivative. We're going to talk more about this lifecycle as we go, but the most helpful bit to take away is the thought that Cultures are alive and fresh and still working things out, whereas Civilizations are (spiritually) old and tired, even if they are materially on top of the world. The example that most helps me is that Spengler placed the Classical Culture from roughly the Doric period (~1100 BCE) until Alexander (~323 BCE), and pretty much <i>all</i> of non-mythical Roman history was in its Civilization phase. One of the most interesting, most studied periods of human history, at least in the West, nearly 600 years, was all in the "dead" phase of Civilization.

<h3 id="org0e0080c">Putting the Above Together</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e0080c">
<p>
As you can see, Spengler had a few different ways of comparing Cultures/Civilizations. The toughest to fit together is the Spiritual Epochs with the other two, but roughly speaking, "Spring" is the Early Period of the Culture and "Summer" is the Late Period, and then the Civilization is split between "Autumn" and "Winter." The tables in the book list examples for each segment from different Cultures/Civilizations (Indian, Egyptian, Chinese, Classical, Arabian, and Western), to give a feeling of what he means by the labels I've copied above. There's a lot of terms that might be a bit head-scratching without Spengler's spelling them out in the work, like what he means by "Form" and so forth, but the general idea comes out pretty clearly: early on in a Culture, the folk have a way of seeing/understanding things that they just <i>have</i> to find a way to make real. This drives them to make all kinds of art and architecture and to come together into a political unit. Eventually, this unit solidifies and has command over great material resources, but has lost its ability to tap into deeper spiritual truths.

<h3 id="org8ecd89a">Where are We? Early Autumn</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8ecd89a">
<p>
So, according to Spengler, the West was moving into the "Early Autumn" or first phases of "Civilization" in the early 20th century, and so we're just a bit further along that curve here about 100 years later. So, we're maybe in the "Caesarism" phase politically (charismatic leaders use the love of the people to seize absolute power), we are somewhere in between rebelling against the artistic forms our Culture developed and emptily aping them, and our philosophical thinking is in the highly abstract phase. I don't know that I'd say this is <i>obviously</i> true, but it's hard to say it's impossible. Whether you agree with this placement or not, the thought that different Cultures/Civilizations follow different arcs, and that we might place our own by careful attention to the past is a useful one, and I hope you find the above tables fruitful in the exercise.

</ul>

<p>
Last year, as part of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">"read only books by dead authors"</a> challenge, I read
both Volumes of Oswald Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>. I found it very
interesting and helpful, but it was not what you would call an easy read. So, I
thought I'd spend a few posts doing my best to put forth the most helpful
thoughts from the book in a way that might be a little more handy. Also, it will
help me get those ways of looking at the world settled into my own head, so even
if I don't succeed at the first, I'll at least have the other one going for me.
</p>

<p>
First, in case you don't know, let's go over who Oswald Spengler is and what was
his magnum opus. Spengler was a German thinker and writer with rather broad
knowledge who lived and wrote around the turn of the 20th century. <i>The Decline
of the West</i> was published in 1918 (first volume) and 1922 (the second). When
first published, it made a huge stir, everyone educated was talking about it,
responding to it, and arguing about it, but these days, you mostly only hear
about him from folks with tastes in less mainstream takes on history. The core
thesis of the book is that groups of humans (Cultures) have a distinctive
lifecycle, like a living thing, this cycle includes growing old and dying, and
that Western civilization is starting into that old age. You might assume from
the publication date that this was just a reaction to WWI, but he actually
completed volume I on the eve of the Great War, and for obvious reasons couldn't
get it published until it was over.
</p>

<p>
Before we talk about Spengler's view of history and the world, let's take a tick
to think about why he's forgotten by most folks these days. The first reason you
might have already guessed: he was a right wing German in the early 20th
century, and that's not exactly a popular description these days. Spengler
didn't much care for Hitler or the Nazis, but he <i>was</i> a German nationalist in the
days before that got stamped out of the country hard. The second reason is that
his theories deal with the differences between "races," another view of the
world not so much in fashion these days. Interestingly, he thought that "race"
had more to do with the land and culture and less to do with biology, but that's
a nuance that most folks don't get to with him. The last reason I'd point out,
though, might be the most interesting: massive cultural cognitive dissonance.
What do I mean? Well, already in Spengler's day, but even more so today,
"Progress" is the core tenet of faith in Western Culture. Everything has been
getting better since as far back as we can look and will just keep getting
better forever. "From the caves to the stars." Well, Spengler took a big ol'
dump all over this way of looking at the world. So, his thinking was rejected by
the culture as a whole, for being incompatible with its core beliefs. That's
just what makes him so interesting and potentially useful, of course.
</p>

<p>
Before we can dig into why he thought the West was/would be in decline, we have
to understand Spengler's whole way of looking at the world. Spengler's
intellectual hero was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He looked to Goethe as a model
of how to understand the world - through science, history, literature, and best
of all, through a well-rounded, holistic view that took all of these into
account. This is a fundamentally <i>qualitative</i> way of understanding, and the West
spent most of the years between Goethe's time and Spengler's working out how to
understand as much of the world as possible <i>quantitatively</i>. Spengler respected
what these approaches could do, and acknowledged a lot of discoveries that came
out of them, but he felt that the mania for quantification had crowded out the
qualitative approach that allows for truly <i>understanding</i> large, messy topics. It
is due to this qualitative approach that <i>Decline of the West</i> is sometimes called
"unscientific," but I would argue that it is instead scientific in an older
way - eighteenth century philosophers would have recognized this work as plenty
scientific, as it is based on a lot of careful empirical observation and drawing
generalizations from those.
</p>

<p>
One method of qualitative science that Spengler relies on extensively, in fact
that provides the framework for the whole work, is <i>morphology</i>, and this is the
bit of Spengler's thinking I'd like to focus on in this post. His approach in
the book is to look at the various cultures of the world and throughout history
as if each is a living being and to look at the structural elements of those
beings. Let's take a tick to ground this in the field Spengler borrowed the
approach from: biology. Let's say that you want to look at both domestic cows
and wild buffalo and find out what's alike and what's not between them. You
could go out in the field and watch some of both kinds of animals and take
careful note of how they behave. You'd see some likenesses, like that both
animals spend a lot of time grazing, gather in herds, and so forth, but you'd
also see some differences - like the cows going into a barn when it got cold, or
being herded around by a dog. This would be an ethological approach. On the
other hand, you might bring one of each animal into the lab and start taking
measurements. You might even cut them apart and start looking at their organs
and bones, seeing how they're shaped, how they fit together, and how they're
linked. This would be a morphological approach. Both ways give you an
understanding of the animals, and you'd learn a lot of the same stuff from both,
since you are still looking at the same animals, but you'd also learn some
things from one approach and not the other.
</p>

<p>
Most history might be thought of as "human ethology" - it focuses on the
behavior of individuals and groups, what they did, when they did it, what kind
of motivations they had, what consequences did they have to live with, and so
forth. Spengler instead wanted to look at history morphologically - what are the
"parts" of the history of different cultures, how are they structured, how do
they fit together, and so forth. The idea is that if you see a period of history
in both the ancient Mediterranean and in China where charismatic leaders ride a
wave of approval from the masses into supreme leadership, well, the history of
both cultures has the same "part," despite some differences, the same way you
could morphologically recognize a wing in a bat and a bird and work out that
they're functionally similar despite the differences.
</p>

<p>
So Spengler surveyed the vast expanse of history that he was familiar with and
looked for what was happening <i>structurally</i>. What he found was that each Great
Culture he had knowledge of had similar "parts," those parts happened in the
same order, and they had similar durations. Put all this together, and you have
a "lifecycle" for the "organisms" that are human cultures. You can look at when
a culture came together and started doing things its own distinct way, and then
match up certain parallel developments with how long after the start they
happen, and you start to see a common arc - early vigorous frothing as groups
within the culture jockey with each other, coming together into the full
flowering of its cultural viewpoint, then things start hardening and become more
focused on material gain, and then you get a Civilization with a lot of nice
things, still going through the motions of its more vigorous younger self, but
not truly doing anything new, and eventually that falls apart, and at best, you
have folks who claim the old identity, but they are a shadow of what they once
were, likely under the influence of some other Culture/Civilization with more
power.
</p>

<p>
We're going to talk more about Spengler's cultural life cycle in some upcoming
posts, but for now I want to focus on the method of morphology specifically. It
takes some judgment - bat wings and bird wings both allow flight through the
adaptation of super long "finger" bones, and so are pretty easy to rule as
"morphologically similar." But what about insect wings? These are still
structures that allow flight, but they are made of wholly different materials
and function in a wholly different way. Whether you decide to rule them
"morphologically similar" will have something to do with why you're examining
these structures. If you're trying to understand how flight works at all, then
identifying very different ways different living things have been able to make
it happen might be useful, and counting all "wings" as "similar" might be
worthwhile. On the other hand, if you're trying to identify how flight evolved
in different groups, you might not even count bats and birds as "morphologically
similar," because they are from such far apart branches of the tree of life and
obviously evolved at different times in different ways. This brings us back to
Spengler's qualitativeness - much of why he is called "unscientific" is because
he makes a lot of judgments about what counts as "similar" - if you look at his
theory and don't find it plausible, you might see it as him fitting facts to
theory. In his defense, he was a <i>fantastically</i> well-educated polymath who really
did know a hell of a lot about a lot of different things, and all of that was
grounded in aesthetic/qualitative engagement with art, literature, philosophy,
and the like, so his judgments are not <i>naive</i>, but they <i>are</i> still judgments that
others might disagree with.
</p>

<p>
So, why did I want to spend a whole post just on "morphology"? Well, it's a
helpful way of looking at things that has largely fallen out of favor in
scientific circles, and with so many fields striving to be as "scientific" as
they can, even those that morphology comes more naturally to have emphasized it
less. Here's one classic example: from Aristotle onward, it's been a standard
part of the study of politics to look at the structure of a government or a
piece thereof - monarchy, oligarchy, or democracy. The United States
Constitution was built on such morphological grounds - make the Executive branch
like a monarchy, the Legislative like a democracy, and the Judicial like an
oligarchy. If you held yourself to only looking at the behavior of specific
politicians, you'd miss some important things about how the US government works.
A less orthodox example is for creativity - for example, I took a look at one
take on what defines Cyberpunk structurally and then applied those
characteristics in a novel way to my D&amp;D setting, Fellhold.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, history is another field where a morphological approach can be
helpful, and we'll see more implications of this as we talk through more of
Spengler's points.

<h2 id="woden_s_three_deals" class="Post">Woden's Three Deals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-woden_s_three_deals">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-April-23
</p>

<p>
Lately, I've been giving some thought to a thread that seems to run through
three of the best-known tales about Woden. The three tales I have in mind are
when Woden gives up his eye for a drink of Meomer's (Mimir's) Well, when he
hangs himself upon the World Tree to find the Runes, and when he brings back the
Mead of Poetry to Esegeard (Asgard). These tales will already be well known to
anyone familiar with Germanish lore, most of all those folks who call upon
Woden. I was looking back over them as I started work on a new <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of
Fallhall's prayer</a>. As I read back through them and thought about how I might
build them into my new prayer, I found a thread of liknesses between these
tales, but what grabbed me even more was that there was one spot where the
thread was <i>not</i> clear, but instead murky. So, after bethinking (meditating) on
this murky bit, I'm writing this post to try to work out what's going on there.
</p>

<p>
Alright, first off, let's do a quick run through of what happens in these tales.
The most straightforward one, and the one that sets the stage for the thread I'm
drawing between them, is Woden giving his eye for a drink from the Well of
Memory. It is told in <i>Voluspa</i> 28 and in <i>Gylfaggining</i> 14. To gain a drink from
this Well, which brings great Wisdom, Woden gives one of his eyes to its keeper,
Meomer. While there are some other takes, such as that by putting his eye in the
Well, Woden has ongoing insight into the memories of all beings in all the
worlds, and thus ever-deepening wisdom, this tale is most often seen as Woden
paying a very high price for a drink of great worth linked with the wisdom that
is Woden's key attribute.
</p>

<p>
Next, we have Woden giving himself to himself as a sacrifice upon the World Tree
in order to win the Runes, as told in <i>Havamal</i> 138-141. He hangs (likely
literally hanged, as this was the most often found kind of sacrifice to Woden -
hanging), wounded by a spear, for nine nights upon the World Tree. He looks
"down" and comes back "up" with the Runes. So, once again, we have Woden paying
a high price for something of great worth linked with wisdom, but here the Runes
rather than a drink. What's interesting, though, is that the <i>root</i> of the World
Tree is called out by name here, and we know that at least one of the roots goes
to Wyrd's Well. We also know that the Wyrds are the ones who carved the Runes
into the tree in the first place, and the Runes are deeply linked with the Wyrds
and their Well. So I do not think it is crazy to consider that at least one part
of winning the Runes was a drink from the Well of Wyrd.
</p>

<p>
By now, you can likely see where I'm going with this, most of all since the last
of these three tales is so <i>very</i> clearly about getting a drink of great worth
linked with wisdom. I'll tell this tale in bit more depth, in part since we <i>have</i>
more depth, but also since it might help with working out the murky bit we're
closing in on. The Mead of Poetry has a somewhat winding backstory, which is
given most thoroughly in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> 1 and is referenced in <i>Havamal</i> 104-110.
When the Ese (Aesir) and Wen (Vanir) came together in frith (peace) after their
war, they all spat into a vat (maybe after chewing some berries, more in a tick)
and from the spit shaped a man called Kvasir. There is some thinking that the
roots of the word Kvasir are linked with a kind of berry that was used to make a
ritual heady drink in elder times. At any rate, Kvasir is the wisest of all
men/Gods, and he wanders the world helping folks out and answering whatever they
ask. A couple of dwarves, though, by the names of Fjalar ("Hider" or "Deceiver"
most likely, but meaning is unsettled) and Galar ("Screamer") kill Kvasir and
brew his blood into mead (the tellings we have don't say why). This is the Mead
of Poetry, and drinking it brings great wisdom. These dwarves aren't through
killing folks yet, though, and they also kill the ettin ("giant") Gilling ("The
Noisy One", or again, "The Screamer") by taking him out rowing in a boat and
sinking it, letting him drown, and then his mourning wife by dropping a
millstone on her. Nasty bit of work, these two. Well, Gilling's son Suttung
("Heavy With Drink," but here again, meaning unsettled) does what is looked for
from kinsfolk in those days and comes to get some kind of wergeld from the
dwarves. He puts them on a rock that floods at the high tide and told them to
give him the Mead of Poetry if they want to get off before they drown, and so he
gets it. Suttung then takes the mead in three holders, <i>Son</i> (either
"Reconcilliation" or "Blood," both of which seem linked with what happened to
Kvasir), <i>Bodhn</i> ("Vessel"), and <i>Odhroerir</i> ("The One That Stimulates to Ecstasy",
likely first the name of the Mead of Poetry itself, but Snorri interpreted a bit
of <i>Havamal</i> as meaning it was the cauldron that held it), and puts it under the
mountain <i>Hnitbjorg</i> ("Colliding Rocks") warded by his daughter, Gunnlodh
("Invitation to Battle").
</p>

<p>
All that backstory before Woden even comes into the tale! Woden sets out to get
the Mead, and along the way, he comes upon nine thralls (slaves) mowing grass
for hay with scythes. He pulls out a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">whetstone</a> and sharpens all of their
scythes. They give the newly sharpened tools a try and are very happy with how
much better they work, so they all want to buy it, each putting forth what
outlay he thinks will get him the stone. Woden, though, instead throws the stone
up into the air, and the thralls clumsily get after it, and in the ruckus slit
each other's throats. Woden goes on his way and finds their owner, who "just so
happens" to be Suttung's brother Baugi ("Ring Shaped"). Baugi is grousing about
losing all his thralls and wondering how he's going to get all the work on his
holding done. Woden says he'll do the work of nine men all summer long, if Baugi
can get him a drink of the Mead of Poetry. Baugi tells him that his brother
Suttung keeps it all to himself, and so he doesn't know if he'll be able to get
a drink for Woden, but he'll at least try. So, Woden spends the summer doing the
work of nine thralls, and sure enough, gets it all done, so Baugi takes him to
see Suttung. Surprising no one, Suttung tells them "hell no" when they ask for a
taste of the mead. Thanks to the work Woden did, though, he gets Baugi to help
him get into the mountain to get at the mead. Baugi pulls out the drill Rati
("Drill," cleverly enough) and begins drilling into the mountain. He stops and
says the hole is good to go, but Woden blows into it and sees that the dust and
rock chips fly back out toward him, which shows that the hole doesn't go all the
way through, so he tells Baugi to keep going. Again, Baugi says it's good, this
time the dust flies through, so Woden turns into a snake to go through the hole,
and for some reason, Baugi tries to stab him with the drill, but he dodges and
gets through the hole and into the mountain.
</p>

<p>
Once inside, Woden turns back into a man and finds Suttung's daughter Gunnlodh
guarding the Mead. To give him a drink, she asks him to spend three nights with
her, and he agrees. After the three nights, she seats him on a golden stool and
offers him each of the three holders of the Mead. Woden, though, takes huge
drinks and drains all three in one sip each. He then flees the mountain, holding
the Mead inside himself, and turns into an eagle to fly back to Esegeard.
Suttung also turns into an eagle and gives chase. Woden gets back to Esegeard
and spits out the Mead into waiting holders, and so now the Ese have the Mead of
Poetry. Snorri tells us that Woden made it just in time, but not what Suttung
did after (was he killed like Thjazi chasing after Idun? Did he fly away in
shame?). He <i>does</i> tell us that it was such a close call that Woden pissed out
some of the Mead, and this is where <i>bad</i> poetry comes from.
</p>

<p>
Alright, so why have I gone into so much depth with this tale, after dealing
with the others so shortly? Well, first off, we <i>have</i> a longer telling of this
tale than the others. Through some putting together of having poems to hand we
no longer have, known kennings, and his own creativity, Snorri spun this one in
far more depth than the others. Anyhow, I've given all this so thoroughly since
I do not know what might be weighty and what not, with the business at hand.
What is that business? Well, I have the inkling that this tale follows the same
framework as the other two, but maybe less markedly. There is not at first blush
a <i>Well</i>, and it is not altogether clear what <i>price</i> Woden paid, but we again deal
with Woden going on a quest to get a drink linked with Wisdom that becomes one
of his hallmarks. For the link, I'm indebted to Maria Kvilhaug in her <i>Maiden
with the Mead</i> and <i>Yggdrasil's Seed</i>. She shows many of the parallels between the
many tales of a Male Seeker going through hardships to reach a Maiden, who gives
Him a drink of Mead which gives some wonderful quality. Well, there's not a
clear maiden in the tale of Meomer's Well, not a clear drink in the winning of
the Runes, and not a clear Well in the winning of the Mead of Poetry, but there
are some hinting links.
</p>

<p>
First, I think it is the "drink" that is likely the common bond between these
tales. This one is fairly readily dealt with: as I said above, the Runes are
<i>very</i> closely linked with the Well of Wyrd, maybe <i>the</i> foremost of "cosmological
wellsprings of drink" in Germanish lore. As such, the thought that at least one
bit of how Woden won the Runes was to drink from this Well is not so
far-fetched. So that gets us a "drink" in all three tales. Next, we have the
lack of a Maiden at the Well of Memory. This one is a bit trickier. Gunnlodh is
very prominently shown in the tale of the Mead of Poetry, Wyrd (Old Norse <i>Urdhr</i>)
is the eldest of the Three Wyrds (Wyrd, Werdhende, and Sculd), and so is implied
in the Winning of the Runes, if we accept the link to the Well of Wyrd, but what
of Meomer's Well? I don't have a straightforward answer here. Meomer is (maybe)
an ettin, is (maybe) Woden's maternal uncle, and is (definitely) an initiatory
figure. In many of these "Maiden with the Mead" tales, the Maiden has a male
warder figure. The best I can do is that Meomer's Well has the warder, but not
the Maiden, at least as told to us. That leaves us with the Well. This might be
even more of a stretch than the bit about the Maiden, but bear with me. One of
the things that struck me about the first two tales is that they have two of the
three Wells given as watering the three roots of the World Tree. Meomer's Well
and Wyrd's Well are both straightforward enough, but where is <i>Hvergelmir</i>? Well,
Kvilhaug puts forward that these Mead-giving Maidens are often in the
Underworld, and may or may not be figures of Death themselves. Hvergelmir is in
the Underworld. One of the Maidens linked with this mythic complex in
complicated ways is Idun, and one of her kennings is "The Keeper of the Sun of
Hvergelmir." I'm not arguing anything as simple as "Gunnlodh is Idun," but I do
think there's enough thematic overlap to make this case: Gunnlodh lives under a
mountain and plays a role similar to other "Underworld Maidens," making it not
crazy that she is a death/Underworld figure. If so, a link with the Well of the
Underworld (Hvergelmir) would not be crazy.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so, however flimsily, we now have a link between drinks from the three
Wells that feed the World Tree that Woden took. At two of them, he paid a clear
price (his eye and his life), but at the third, the price is not as clear. Is it
the three nights with Gunnlodh? Given that she isn't said to be ugly or
terrible, and none of the latter day drawings of her felt that she should be
either, this doesn't seem like much of a "cost." One thought is that the <i>Havamal</i>
telling might hint that Woden <i>married</i> Gunnlodh and then skipped out on her once
he got the Mead as a dowry. If this reading is right, then might the cost be
giving up his word/good name/wedded life with Gunnlodh? Maybe the cost is the
summer Woden spent working for Baugi. If so, was the price paid the work itself,
or the giving up of status in allowing himself to be a thrall? Does the
whetstone have anything to do with it? How about Kvasir's backstory? And what of
all this drilling and double crossing stuff?
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm leaning toward some combination of lowering Himself to thralldom
and actually doing the work of nine men as the initiatory "price" paid by Woden
for the Mead of Poetry, but I haven't wholly settled on that. I have the
niggling feeling that I'm missing something in the symbolism of the tale. If you
have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

<p>
So, I was reading thinking about the three wells from which the roots of
Yggdrasil, the World Tree, draw their sustenance, as one does. It struck me that
Woden paid a high price and gained something from at least two of the three,
giving up his eye for a drink from Meomer's Well and giving up his life to wrest
the Runes from Wyrd's Well, but what, then, of Hvergelmir? I wondered if maybe
Woden's <i>other</i> famous drink, the Mead of Poetry, might somehow be linked here.
Sure enough, poking around Maria Kvilhaug's <a href="https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/23958/18497.pdf">Maiden and the Mead</a> and <a href="https://the3littlesisters.com/catalog_explorer/the-seed-of-yggradsill/">The
Seed of Yggdrasil</a>, she proposes just such a link. Now, that led me to wonder
"what did he pay for that drink?" The ready answer is the three nights he spent
with Gunnlodh, but that hardly seems to go in the same category as
self-mutilation and sacrifice. Wondering this led me to look again at the rest
of the myth, as told in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, and it once again
struck me that there's a bunch of little details that seem. . . odd. One of
which is a scene featuring a whetstone, which reminded me that there's another
myth prominently featuring a whetstone (Thor's duel with the giant Hrungnir),
which led me to ask myself, Jerry Seinfeld style, "what's the deal with
whetstones?"

<h3 id="org46c6ad5">Odin's One Weird Trick to Get a Summer Job</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org46c6ad5">
<p>
First off, the bit of the tale that got me started down this road: on his way to
get some of the mead, Odin meets nine thralls mowing grass with scythes. (Aside:
I'm switching to all Norse names for telling the tale, since that's the version
we have. Maybe sometime I'll get into how I treat Old Norse vs Old English vs
modern Englished names of the Gods). Odin pulls out a whetstone and offers to
sharpen up their scythes. They agree, and once he does, they do a few test
swings and are thrilled - the scythes work <i>way</i> better now. All nine of them want
to buy the whetstone, each putting forth what he's willing to pay. Instead of
taking any of these deals, Woden throws the whetstone up in the air, and in
their clumsy haste to snatch it up, they all kill each other with their newly
razor-sharp scythes. As "luck" would have it, these nine thralls belonged to the
brother of the giant who has the mead, and Odin offers to do the work of nine
men over the summer if Baugi can get him a taste of that mead. Baugi says
"sorry, man, my brother has it and he won't even share it with me, but I'll see
if I can get him to let you have some."

<h3 id="orgd0db04b">Stephen Mitchell to the Rescue - Whetstones Stand for Authority</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0db04b">
<p>
So, what the heck is going on here besides a weird fairy-tale kind of excuse for
Odin to get an "in" with sons of Gilling? I've long wondered this, but never
strongly enough to run it down, until now. I took a look at a bunch of my
<a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#list_of_books_on_germanish_belief_with_thoughts">books</a>, and found some intriguing hints, but nothing really satisfying. Then
through a shot-in-the-dark web search ("whetstones in Norse myth"), I found "The
Whetstone as Symbol of Authority in Old English and Old Norse" by Stephen A.
Mitchell, which pretty much answered the very thing I was asking myself.
Mitchell argues that whetstones were a symbol for kingly might across Germanish
lands and for a very long time, drawing on archaeological, linguistic, and
written evidence. He believes this claim for a few linked reasons: 1. widespread
metaphorical linkage between "sharpness" and wits, 2. kings were often symbolic,
or even literal, "weapon givers", 3. whetstones were used by smiths, who were
magic and holy, and 4. there's seems to be a Proto-Indo-European link between
some kind of "stone" and the sky/it's chief God.
</p>

<p>
First, all of the Germanish tongues use words for sharp/sharpen/hone to mean
both that someone is clever or witful, but also as verbs meaning to "egg on" or
"incite" (the "egg" there, by the way, is a borrowing from Old Norse from a word
that means <i>to sharpen</i>, but the English phrase comes straight from Old Norse
usage). You can see how these would be key king skills, and sure enough, in the
sagas, we see Kings who are good at their job doing these very things, and kings
who are bad at their job either not doing them, or doing them poorly. King
Canute's worthless older brother was called "Harald Hein," <i>Hein</i> being a cognate
for "hone," in the same way that he might have been called "tiny" if he was very
fat. So, we know that the way folks talked and thought in lands where Germanish
tongues were spoken saw "sharpness" and "sharpening" as things that go with
kingship.
</p>

<p>
Next, among such warlike folk, Kings often put swords in their followers hands,
whether literally ("here's a sword - go kill that guy") or symbolically ("and
where did the wealth to get such fine gear come from? Oh, that's right, the rich
farmland I gave you"). Since swords were so closely linked with kings, anything
to do with swords would likely be fair game for becoming a symbol of kingship.
And whetstones did just that! In the well-known Sutton Hoo burial, they found a
scepter with a piece of whetstone as the ball on the top of it (likely linked
side thought: the scepter itself comes from hammers/clubs wielded by kings,
which are themselves linked with the blunt weapon of the fighter of the Gods -
Thor's Hammer, Hercules's club, and so forth). Besides the two myths I brought
up, there are also two sagas where a whetstone stands for kingly might/right. In
the Mead story, it might mean something that Odin uses a symbol of kingship to
take out some thralls, but I haven't worked out wholly what that might be yet.
</p>

<p>
Third, and now we're getting more mythological, from a very early time, smiths
were seen as having awesome and uncanny powers, very likely with religious
overtones. The whetstone is one of the tools of the metalworking trade, and so
it likely took on some of this religious awe and mystery. Also, whetstones often
throw off sparks, which look rather like lightning - bright, fast-moving light
from nowhere that can start a fire. That might help to explain why Hrungnir
brings a whetstone to a magic weapon fight. This link with the holy would likely
strengthen the associations we talked about above, even if in later times it was
not part of day-to-day life to see smiths as magic and/or holy, symbols can
linger on for a very long time after the association that led to it being a
symbol is forgotten - like scepters as signs of kingly might/right and the clubs
they were based on.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, Mitchell points out the comparative evidence from far-flung
Indo-European tongues that some words for "stone" and "sky" have the same root.
There are also some mythological parallels. What's striking about the four
Germanish tales we have about whetstones, though, is that <i>three</i> of them show the
stone somehow moving through the air - Odin throwing it up high, Hrungnir
throwing his at Thor, and in <i>Gautrek's Saga</i>, the king throws a whetstone at his
hawk to get it back to work. So, if we buy that the sparks from whetstones were
linked with lightning and that the "stone" linked etymologically with "sky"
could be a whetstone, then these stories of hurled whetstones likely come from a
story about some kind of holy whetstone moving through the air (clouds? the sun?
I dunno).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdde12b0">
<p>
I haven't had time to really let this sink in yet - for one thing, I want to
bethink (meditate) at least a few times on all of these tales, what they share,
how they are unalike, and so forth. I still haven't worked out what the link is
to Odin's payment for the mead, but I did <i>at last</i> unknot something that had been
bugging me for years, so I call that a win.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb254728">
<p>
(The post's name is a joke, by the way. Lest I die of maximum irony, I don't
plan on talking about myself much here.)
</p>

<p>
For the past few weeks, I spent most of my spare time going through the archives
of <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/archives.html">The Last Psychiatrist</a>, a "post-rationalist" blog written by, you guessed it,
a psychiatrist. It's wide-ranging, covering everything from in-depth breakdowns
of studies on psychiatric medication to write ups of pop culture. One thread,
though, became maybe his main theme, and it pulled me in and wouldn't let go:
Narcissism. The likeness he paints of this way of seeing the world and how rife
it is in today's America seemed worryingly spot-on. Ready to become deeply
worried about yourself, your friends and family, and your culture? Then climb
aboard.
</p>

<p>
First off, let's lay out what he means by "narcissism," as what he's talking
about is neither what most folks mean when they say the word, nor what the DSM
calls "Narcissistic Personality Disorder." For The Last Psychiatrist (hereafter
"TLP"), narcissism does <i>not</i> mean "grandiosity" or "having a wildly overblown
opinion of yourself." Instead, it means having an identity that you have
more-or-less made up, rather than one that has grown out of what you <i>do</i>, and
guarding that identity keenly. Folks who do this lean toward seeing themselves
as the main character in their own story and anyone else as only backup
characters. So far, so irksome, but so what? Well, when a narcissist's identity
is threatened, the wonted answer is <i>rage</i> - anger wildly out of keeping with what
set it off. When we're lucky, this is only a laughable shouting fit.
</p>

<p>
When we're not, narcissists kill their whole family and then themselves.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to get TLP's take in a (fairly) short shape, I'd steer you to <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2006/12/if_this_is_one_of_the_sexiest.html">this
post</a> as the clearest "summary" (it's still pretty long). If you <i>truly</i> want to
get his full take, with lots of examples of what he means, check out every post
under "<a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/">Narcissism</a>". Even there, many of his other posts not under that header
still touch on it. If you're willing to settle for my take, read on for a
(fairly) short rundown.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9d59caf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9d59caf">Identity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9d59caf">
<p>
So, the root of narcissism seems to be a "constructed" identity. "I am a rebel"
or "I am a sensitive artist" or "I am a no-nonsense businessman" or whatever.
These tend to be at least somewhat conscious - it's how you think of yourself,
whether or not you explicitly put a label on it (but you likely do). What's so
bad about that, though? Well, the problem is what's behind these self-assigned
identities: vast, yawning insecurity. You desperately <i>tell yourself</i> "I'm a
sensitive artist" because deep down, you are worried that you are <i>nothing</i>. You
feel adrift and meaningless, and you hope that if you convince everyone (but
most of all yourself) that you <i>really are</i> a sensitive artist, that insecurity
will go away. There's a catch 22 in all this, though: you know you're faking it.
So, if other people <i>really do</i> start treating you like a sensitive artist: you
get gallery showings, you're written up in snooty magazines, models and rich
folks want to be seen hanging out with you, and so forth, you end up subject to
Groucho Marx's famous quip: "I don’t want to belong to any club that would
accept me as one of its members."
</p>

<p>
Let's take a far more common example. You have a young man who wants to be the
kind of guy that women like. After first longing for girls that he's afraid to
talk to, he eventually works up the nerve to ask a few out, and he gets
rejected. Rather than turning bitter and assuming it's them that don't see his
greatness (another unfortunately common narcissistic type), he decides he'll
work out what he's doing wrong. So he works out, starts dressing nicer, learns
how to look and act confident, and then he asks out a beautiful girl, she says
yes, it goes well, and they start dating. You might think he'd be like "hooray,
I have successfully become the kind of man that women want! My identity is
secure!" but you would very likely be wrong. Instead, for as long as things go
well, part of him is thinking "did I just fool her into liking me?" and if the
answer is "yes", then she's not a good source of validation, because she's too
easily tricked. If the answer is "no", then she's not a good source of
validation, because she's a bad judge of character - she likes this person that
is so unlikable? What's wrong with her? It gets worse, though - even if all of
that remains in the background or shut down, if/when things go badly and they
break up, well, now he has "proof" that women don't really like him at all, or
that all his work phony, or what have you.
</p>

<p>
This will all likely either sound completely nuts or horrifyingly familiar. The
problem was that our hypothetical dude was too focused on his "felt sense of
identity" and not enough on "what are the things I've done and how do they
compare to an external set of standards that I have internalized as truly
important." Instead of asking "am I a guy girls want to be with?" it would have
been better if he had learned to value <i>for itself</i>, being fit, being comfortable
taking calculated risks, showing respect to himself and those around him by
dressing well, treating romantic partners with love and respect, and so forth.
That way, his sense of "who am I?" is not based on a <i>label</i> and is not based on
"what does she think of me," but is instead based in "well, it's important to me
to do certain things. Did I do them? Well, at least kinda, the best I could.
Yeah, I fell down here and here, but I did a pretty good job there."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4cb1640" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4cb1640">Main Character</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4cb1640">
<p>
One way that this guarding of identity shows up is that the narcissist sees
himself as the lead character in his own movie or book, everyone else is only a
background character. Of course, this is somewhat metaphorical, a way to talk
about how a narcissist can't put himself in someone else's shoes. But <i>also,</i>
thanks to the pop culture that raised us all, a lot of times this is very nearly
literally true: a narcissist sees his life as a story, that it "must" have some
deeper meaning right around the corner, and one day he'll be seen as the special
hero he badly wants to be.
</p>

<p>
This shows up as everything getting linked back to the narcissist. It's not
about doing what's good for the children, it's about <i>am I be a good father</i>? It's
not about acknowledging the grief of someone at the funeral, it's about <i>am I a
supportive friend</i>? It's not about working with someone worthy that you love to
build a life together, it's <i>am I the kind of man who would have a wife like
this</i>?
</p>

<p>
The more narcissistic someone is, the less it even crosses his mind to think of
things any other way - what other ways of thinking even are there? Different
ways of looking at me?
</p>

<p>
If you want to spot a narcissist in the wild, one good rule of thumb is to look
for how many times he uses "I, me, my, mine." If you ask him about someone else,
mark how quickly it gets linked back to what he knows or has done, or if you get
a beat with puzzlement as he wraps his brain around this weird way of thinking -
<i>other people's perspectives? Who knew</i>?

<div id="outline-container-orgc82b1c7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc82b1c7">Narcissistic Injury</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc82b1c7">
<p>
The worst thing that can happen to a narcissist is to be confronted with a
threat to his identity. The "successful businessman" that is about to be exposed
as faking it through massive debt. The "family values" politician about to be
found out for having gay sex in airport bathrooms. The "promising young man"
confronted with the fact that he is no longer young and he has squandered
whatever promise he once had. The very worst threat to a narcissist's identity,
though, is "who are you, again?" Things may be going <i>terribly</i> for a narcissist,
but as long as he can tell himself the suffering is <i>about him</i>, then he's still
the main character, his identity is intact as "persecuted hero" or
"long-suffering stoic" or whatever. Telling your narcissistic husband than
you're leaving him, getting into a screaming match about it, dragging it out
through awful family court drama - all of that is, at least, still somewhat
about him. If you just leave in the night and never speak to him again, just
send the paperwork to be signed, no emotion, no reaction - <i>that</i> is a
narcissistic injury.
</p>

<p>
The frightening thing about narcissistic injury is, as I mentioned in the
lead-in, it leads to <i>rage</i>. The unbearable tension between "who I <i>need</i> to think
of myself as" with "here's evidence you're definitely not that guy" is resolved
by lashing out at whomever is felt to most strongly be causing this tension. If
a man thinks he's a good husband, but his wife points out to him he's never
around, he doesn't help with the chores or the kids, and he doesn't even have a
good job as an excuse for any of that, he's going to be <i>pissed</i> and it's going to
be <i>at her</i>, because on some level he knows she's right. Again, the vast majority
of the time, narcissistic injury leads to the equivalent of a temper tantrum -
screaming, insults, accusations, and so forth. Sometimes, though, it can be much
worse. If you go and look at what we know about folks who have done mass
killings or killed their girlfriends/spouses/families (and often themselves
after), it pretty much always becomes clear that it's about some identity and a
threat to it. So, if you have someone in your life that this post seems to apply
to more than you'd like, think very hard and be <i>very careful</i>. Maybe there's a
gentle way to nudge them toward a less narcissistic outlook, or maybe you need
to go. Whatever the case, think twice before you threaten them with public
shame, anything that would make either the folks they care about most, or lots
of folks (or both), see them as not what they want to think they are.

First off, by this meaning, <i>everybody</i> is at least a little narcissistic, and you
have to be. Secondly, if you're young (teens or twenties), more of this is
developmentally normal. So don't give up on yourself yet.
</p>

<p>
That being said, if some of this post left you feeling unsettled (as TLP's posts
did for me), the way forward is both straightforward and very hard. As much as
you can, you need to think of other folks as their own beings, with their own
will, <i>not</i> as what they are to you, and you need to take more heed of what you <i>do</i>
than "who I am". So, don't ask yourself "how can I be a better father?", instead
ask "what can I do to help my daughters?" Don't say "I want to be more secure in
myself", instead say "here's how my deeds stack up to an outside, measurable
standard." As I said, straightforward, but hard.
</p>

<p>
Journaling, therapy, meditation, and other ways of finding insights about
yourself can help you come to know that this is something you might need need to
work on, but it seems they don't do much to help you change since the <i>point</i> of
narcissism is to ward off change. What's the way around this? Use your
narcissistic leanings on behalf of something better and "fake it till you make
it."
</p>

<p>
Worried you have trouble seeing your kin as anything other than outgrowths of
yourself? Then make the identity that you work so hard to guard that of
"steadfast husband and father." Maybe it doesn't "feel true," you know you're
faking it? So what? It's not for you! It's for them. If you want to be "a
writer", well, start cranking words out, <i>most of all if it feels fake</i>. Just keep
going. One day, you'll have a body of work, and instead of saying "I'm a
writer", you can say "I wrote that." Lastly, adopting a more-or-less explicit
code of ethics/behavior that is grounded in what you <i>do</i> rather than "who you
are" seems like it ought to help - religion or other spiritual practice is
likely helpful here, as long as it pushes you. If you find yourself using your
religion to give yourself a pass - "I know I spent a week and thousands of
dollars on hookers and blow, but Jesus still loves me, so my wife will too" -
then you have yoked it to the narcissism.
</p>

<p>
All of this is hard work, not least because our whole pop culture and the way we
were raised pushes us toward narcissism, and if you're an adult, you've likely
settled into it somewhat.
</p>

<p>
So, if you want to do better, you have to ask: "who might I be hurting, and what
can I do to stop?"

<p>
Whew, I think I have <i>at last</i> gotten to the shape of the "Hail Idun" that I want to use for my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>. Those of you that have been following along have seen that it's taken rather a lot of tinkering to get here (and I didn't show all my work!), but I'm pretty happy with what I've gotten to, and my Rune casting says this ought to go well.
</p>

<p>
A very big thanks to everyone who has shared feedback on my earlier tries at getting this right - all of your thoughts were very welcome, even if I didn't end up going with the words or thoughts you put forward, you still helped steer me toward what we have here. Of course, if you don't like it, that's all on me!
</p>

<p>
As I believe I've said before, this prayer is rather idiosyncratic and builds on what has come out of my bethinking (meditation), divination, and worship. What might strike you as odd, though, is that I didn't put in anything about apples and did put in "ale." Mostly this comes from some of the kennings for Idun given by Snorri, such as "ale giver" and "drink willow." I've come to think (shaped somewhat by Maria Kvilhaug's thinking) that Idun is linked with the myths of Goddesses/Giantesses that ward/give drinks with magical/religious weight. The lack of apples is only since I wanted to keep in a link to Yggdrasil and to the "drink," and I ran out of room!
</p>

<blockquote>
Hail Idun,<br>
Yggdrasil's Seed,<br>
well-spoken wife of wordcraft,<br>
wreathed in blessed blossoms.<br>
<br>
Holy Idun,<br>
open our hearts<br>
with ale's dearest drink<br>
to awakening of everlasting life.
</blockquote>

<p>
I hope that you find this prayer helpful, whether to use as-is, or as a spur to coming up with your own. Either way, I'd love to hear how it goes.

Back when I was about to get out of the Army, for a while I thought I was going to become a farmer. One of my good buddies turned me on to Joel Salatin, the founder of <a href="https://polyfacefarms.com/">Polyface Farm</a>, who has worked out a way to raise animals ethically, in a way that helps the environment, and make good money doing it. I was inspired and bought all his books (at the time). Looking back, there was more than a little wishful thinking involved, of course - I grew up in suburbia and have never raised/cared for animals that weren't pets. I ought to have found a way to "test drive" farming - go volunteer somewhere, keep some backyard chickens, that kind of thing. For better or worse, my wife was not so thrilled with the idea, so I found another way. Salatin's whole approach is pretty cool, but I want to share one piece of it here.
</p>

<p>
Salatin manages to keep more cattle per acre than any of the neighboring farms. There's a few things that let him do this - like a commitment to building soil through composting and using the farm for more than just cattle - he raises sheep and pigs in a way that mimics a natural ecosystem, similar to Takao Furuno's approach described in <i>The Power of Duck</i>. The main way, though, is both counter-intuitive and simple: smaller paddocks. In case agricultural vocabulary is not one of your hobbies, a "paddock" is a fenced-in area for the keeping of livestock. When raising cattle, often folks will not just let them loose on their whole land, but will instead rotate them through a few paddocks. Salatin's paddocks at Polyface Farm are much smaller than those on most ranches. The result? More cows per acre.
</p>

<p>
Sounds bad, right? "Cramming cows into smaller paddocks, forcing them to survive on less land! Open pastures!" That's not actually what's happening here, though. Do you know what cows do when given wide-open pastures? They spread way the hell out. Remember above when I mentioned ecosystems? Well, when you look at ruminants in the wild, what do they do? They huddle together while grazing. Why? Protection from predators. For many reasons, Salatin doesn't fill his farm with wolves, but he <i>does</i> want his cows to huddle together. See, it turns out that when cows spread out, they get very picky - they only eat the <i>tastiest</i> grass, and then they wander over, skip over all the iceberg-equivalent grass and go to the next clump of baby spinach. Cows need variety in their diets, though. If you let them eat anything they want from the full buffet, they skip a lot of what's available. On the other hand, when they're squished together with a bunch of other cows, they eat whatever's in reach before their neighbors can get to it. You've likely already guessed where this is going: smaller paddocks force cows to clump together, which makes them eat more of the available grass, so you get better efficiency while the cows eat just as well (actually better: the variety means more vitamins and the like). Not only do the cows eat more of the grass on the same acreage, you know what grass does over the spring and summer? It <i>grows</i>. Which means that you can rotate back to the same paddock after a few weeks. The smaller paddocks then also mean that you can rotate back sooner, which is even <i>more</i> efficiency. You have more cows, that are better fed, and therefore tastier, on the same amount of land, <b>and</b> the cows are even happier about it, than if you'd let them "roam free(ish)" on the entirety of your land.
</p>

<p>
As an exercise for the reader, I encourage you to think about any other mammals that come to mind who are regularly allowed to spread out nearly as much as they like and do as they damn well please, but maybe were better off when circumstances constrained them to huddling together, finding every bit of value in the immediate space they could.

A bit late tonight, as my kids were home for Spring Break and after they got to bed, my wife and I finished watching <i>The Sopranos</i> for the first time (very short thoughts: great show, stupid ending, though not inconsistent thematically). At any rate, I've been meditating on the words for my take on a "Hail Idun" all week, taking into account a lot of thoughts from the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/223141.html?thread=39594405#cmt39594405">feedback I got</a>.

</p>

<p>
The first thing I have to say is that I'm not wholly happy with my thoughts below. I've read the book and I'm thinking about it, but I might need to do more to truly soak it in. I started writing this post to get those thoughts in order, and now that I've done so, some of it has come together, but other bits have stayed murky. That's all to say, I may come back to this book, and I don't know how long I'll stand behind what I have to say below - we'll see how things go!
</p>

<p>
This book comes highly recommended in several "How to Heathen" books, like Galina Krasskova's <i>Modern Guide to Heathenry</i>. Written in 1982 by Paul C. Bauschatz, who seems to have been an English professor at the University of Maine and published by the University of Massachusetts press, it's <i>very</i> hard to find a copy to buy these days, but seems to be pretty readily available in large libraries (I checked out a copy from the university where I work). My guess is that it didn't get that big a print run, since it's a fairly niche topic, but then Heathens took to it and bought up all the copies and there's never been a reprint. I'm thinking about writing to the publisher to ask them to consider a reprint, given that if you can find a copy at all (checks <a href="https://www.alibris.com">alibris.com</a> - nope), it goes for (checks Amazon) at least $980. Seems like a market opportunity to me.

<h3 id="orgf7ed435">The Main Idea - Pre-Christian Germanish Folk Saw Time Very Unlike Us</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf7ed435">
<p>
At any rate, why is this book so sought after by today's heathens? It sets out to explore the pre-Christian Germanish worldview, to try to understand what it was like "from the inside." Specifically, Bauschatz argues that the pre-Christian Germans had a <i>very</i> different conception of how time worked and that this is reflected in their myth, cultural practices and artifacts, and language. Since it turns out you can't really talk about fundamental conceptions of time without getting into cosmology, causality, and other pretty big topics, this turns out to have a lot of interesting things to say for folks interested in understanding Germanish beliefs and lore.
</p>

<p>
So what is this very different way of thinking of time? In short, the Western Christian/post-Christian view of time is the familiar linear "past, present, future," and from a theological perspective, that line exists within an enclosing timeless eternity. Bauschatz didn't make this comparison, but I can't help but see the enclosing timelessness as Magian and the linear perception of time nested within it as Faustian, and the attempt to wed them together the outcome of the pseudomorphosis that produced European Christianity. The elder Germans, though, seem to have seen time as being made of "past and not-past," and of these, the past had far more weight. I'm still working my way through all of this, which is part of why I'm writing these thoughts down, but if I understand right, the main idea is that the importance of things can only be seen in hindsight. A lot of stuff happens, but most of it ends up being trivial - nothing that matters comes of it. Some things, though, become the causes for the events that matter.

<h3 id="orga43be03">The Well and the Tree - Past Happenings and What Grows from Them</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga43be03">
<p>
So, what are the "Well" and the "Tree" in the name of the book? To my readers who know their way around Germanish Lore, this will be clear enough - the Well of Wyrd and the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. In the lore, the Yggdrasil is said to hold all of the world, and to have its roots in one or more wells, but the best known is the Well of Wyrd, or if you would rather have the Old Norse, <i>Urdhrbrunnr</i>. Now, that word <i>brunnr</i> doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean a "well" in the sense of a shaft dug deep into the ground, lined with stone, and with a bucket to draw water from it, as you likely think of when you hear "well." It seems to have been used to mean all of: wells, springs, streams, and catch basins. The heart of the meaning seems to have been "something from which drinking water is drawn." In today's Germanish tongues, it has mostly specialized to one of those meanings, and in English has almost wholly vanished, other than in a few steadnames that end in "-burn" or "-bourne." The three Norns who tend this "well" - <i>Urdhr</i>, <i>Verdhandi</i>, and <i>Skuld</i> in Old Norse (which is attested), or <i>Wyrd</i>, <i>Werthende</i>, and <i>Sculd</i> in Old English (which is a modern reconstruction) - may or may not have been a conscious borrowing of the Greek <i>Moirae</i> or "Fates," but the thought that the world is a Tree that grows out of a nourishing water source tended by (a) wise woman/women might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">very old indeed</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bauschatz argues that these are mythological representations of the way that the elder Germanish folk thought of the world and time. He pulls together archaeological findings, artwork, story motifs, and the use of language to make his case. He does his best to reconstruct what that sense of world and time might have been like, since it seems like it might have been rather unlike how the folks of today see the world, and even more so unlike how we see time. The heart of what these represent to Bauschatz is the <i>containment</i> of the Well and the <i>branching</i> of the Tree. They are linked by a sense of life and growth. The Tree is kept healthy and growing by the water and mud of the Well, and the doings of the Worlds held in/made up by the Tree "fall down" into the Well and renew it. The "now" is the accumulation/fulfillment of everything that has come before, and so the past is at its "fullest" <i>right now</i>. The idea that things started out perfect and have been getting worse, that the world has been deteriorating in a way that will be washed away/renewed by some future event, seems to be wholly outside of how elder Germanish folks saw things.
</p>

<p>
This leads to a few implications: first, the future is not set, but it's not wholly unguessable either. One way to put it might be that the elder Germanish folk would look at a batter hitting the ball and hear the bat hit the ball and see the form of the batter and think "wow, that might be a home run" rather than focusing on the outfielder running to catch the ball and wondering if he'll be at the right place at the right time. Secondly, learning what happened in the past is of great worth, because it's the best way you have of learning about how cause and effect work. Thirdly, doing great deeds lays the needed groundwork for great things to come - you renew the well and feed the tree when you leave great things behind you. These three things seem like a lot of why this book has so strongly struck today's heathens, and I can see why.

<div id="outline-container-orga090952" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga090952">The Linguistic Evidence - What Future Tense?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga090952">
<p>
Very likely the source of Bauschatz's theory, and I suspect the bit that he was most interested in, is a grammatical observation about the German language family. Namely, grammatically-speaking, <i>no</i> Germanish tongue expresses the future morphologically. In fact, <i>every</i> Germanish tongue only conjugates its verbs into past and non-past. This part gets pretty technical, enough so that even as someone who took linguistics classes in College, majored in Latin and Greek, and has read a lot about the linguistic evidence for the origin and dispersal of Indo-European languages, I found it hard to follow.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a quick side trip into linguistic concepts and terminology in case the above paragraph read like gobbledygook to you. What do I mean about expressing grammatical concepts "morphologically"? First off, "morphological" is a fancy word for "in the shape of," and when used in linguistics is used to refer to the sounds made in a word, and is most of all used when the sounds of a word <i>change</i> to reflect some change in meaning. For example, "write" is in the present tense, but when I change the vowel to "o", we get "wrote", which is now in the past tense. That's a morphological change. So is making something plural by putting and "-s" on the end - like "kid" and "kids," or weirder changes like "child" and "children." So far, so good?
</p>

<p>
Most Indo-European languages made/make morphological changes to words to convey what they are doing in a sentence grammatically. If you only speak English, this can be tough to get your head around, because we don't do much of that and instead express grammatical function by putting words next to each other - for example, to show who is writing, we put a pronoun next to the word "I write," "you write," and so forth. To show future tense, we add in "will" - "I will write." There's a variety of historical reasons for this that we can get into another time, but one of the contributing factors is what Bauschatz is getting into here, and we'll talk about that in a second.
</p>

<p>
To make the idea of morphological changes to show grammatical function a little clearer, let's take a look at another language that does more than English - Latin. Here, <i>videbo</i> means "I will see" - the <i>vide-</i> bit is the root, meaning "see" and the <i>-bo</i> bit says "I will." If I wanted to say "I will be seen" (passive voice) or "if [something happened], I would see" (subjunctive), you'd make more changes to the verb (<i>videbor</i> and <i>videam</i> respectively). Morphological changes like this seem to have been a big part of how proto-Indo-European worked, which is why all Indo-European languages today make at least some morphological changes to words to convey grammatical meaning. What those changes were in proto-Indo-European is a matter of some debate, and harder to describe than the examples above, but Bauschatz goes into it in the book.
</p>

<p>
The short version is that it seems like proto-Indo-European was doing <i>something</i> similar to tense with morphological changes, but that the various daughter languages evolved in slightly different ways. The Germanish kindred of tongues seems to have evolved to where you had a morphological past and a morphological "not past." Weird as it is to think about, they didn't seem to feel the need to express that something "will happen" in the future until they started being Christian. Take a closer look at how we put something in the future now: "I <i>will</i> write." We don't think about it much, but that "will" is <i>exactly</i> the same word as the will in "willpower." The sense is "I will it to happen," meaning "it is my intention right now to do that thing in the future." Every Germanish tongue has a similar "workaround" for expressing futurity - we slap some kind of helping verb onto a "not past" form of the main verb, and those helping verbs usually mean something like "have in mind" or "intend" or "am obliged to." Fun fact: "shall" as in "I shall do the thing," is etymologically linked with "should," which is the English cognate to the Norn "Skuld."
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, Bauschatz argues that Germanish tongues lack a morphological "future tense" because the idea that you can talk about things in the future as if they're certain, established, "real," just in a different conceptual "place" was outlandish to the folks who spoke Proto-Germanic. The best they could do was to say "well, this is what I intend to happen" or "given what's happened, the most likely outcome seems to be this." As the speakers of these tongues Christianized, they had to grapple with a worldview that saw the future as a more definite thing, something that held the dearest hope of the new religion.

<h3 id="orgfd0bd63">Some Downsides - Academicese, Lack of Grounding in Ways of Belief</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfd0bd63">
<p>
Overall, I rather liked the book and it sparked a lot of thoughts, but it has some downsides. For starters, at times you can tell that this book was written in the 80s by an English professor, because it often (usually?) indulges in post-modern academic jargon when it could just state something plainly. Often enough that it's actually hard to follow at times. I can sympathize that Bauschatz's task is a tough one, trying to understand and describe a different way of understanding time and the world than you and your audience take for granted, but it often feels like he leans too hard into abstract terms and the way of talking about things that his field expected at the time to demonstrate you were a member in good standing. Secondly, Bauschatz is very clearly coming at this stuff from a way of looking at things that takes as given that these stories, these ways of thinking, and so forth are nothing more than stories made up to cope with the world, nor more or less true than anyone else's. When he dives deep, it is into the language used. He doesn't seem to give much weight to the stories as stories, as units of meaning with their own worth. There are pros and cons when a writer is a believer in the field being written about (and when not!), but here, I think Bauschatz's valiant attempts to understand what it was like to see the world as an elder German are undercut by his unwillingness to take seriously "what if some bits of how they saw the world were right? what if those things really are handled by Goddesses?

Overall, I think this book is well worth reading and sheds a lot of light on how time, causality, and "fate" are shown in the Germanish lore. That being said, it doesn't seem to do so in the clearest, most straightforward way it might. There are a lot of times where I found myself going "why don't you just say what you mean?" I had hoped this post might be a start toward re-stating the worthwhile insights in a more straightforward way, but I think there's more work to come on that front.

<p>
Well, after the comments on my <a href="https://jprussell.dreamwidth.org/2951.html">List of Germanish Books with Thoughts</a> went rather long and ended up taking a lengthy detour into discussing Jordan Peterson's way of understanding myths, as laid out in his book <i>Maps of Meaning</i> and in loads of lectures since, I reckoned it might be helpful to spell out that framework as clearly and straightforwardly as I might, because this is one area where I think Peterson is not at his strongest. So many of his lines of thinking and research are linked in his head and have implications for each other, he often fares far afield in a way that can be hard to follow, especially if you're new to his thinking.
</p>

<p>
That being said, I once told a friend that if you listen to enough of Peterson's lectures, in at least one of them, he will spell out his way of thinking about a key topic from the very most bedrock concepts up to the widest implications, and he'll make every step as firmly supported as he knows how. Unfortunately, in every <i>other</i> lecture, he will just refer back to the higher-level implications and how they relate to the topic at hand. His more recent books <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, and presumably (I've yet to read it) <i>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</i>, do a decent job of laying things out in an order that makes sense and builds on each other, but with a lot less of the depth than <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, which I found a bit disappointing. At any rate, if I might flatter myself a moment, I've long felt like my (rather boring) super power is to be able to listen to questions folks have about a topic and understand what it is they're actually confused by, and therefore what answer would help resolve their confusion. I wouldn't have thought this was much of a super power, but after years being on both sides of a classroom, sitting through corporate meetings, attending military trainings and debriefs, and so forth, I've found that it's <i>really</i> common for folks trying to explain things to get a question, and then answer something way different, often while missing the fairly easy distinction the questioner was actually looking for. And so I set out, modestly, to try to more clearly set out the thinking of someone who has made himself known worldwide and rather wealthy by explaining things.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org33ff23c">
<p>
Okay, so if you dig into <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, a decent chunk of the book will be dedicated to explaining some concepts about neurobiology and animal behavior that Peterson wants to use as the foundation for everything that follows. His goal in laying all of this out is to give as firm a material grounding as he can to all of the symbolic and narrative stuff he talks about later. This section is interesting, impressive, and with what little I know of the field, seems pretty comprehensively argued. That being said, if you are <i>not</i> coming at this from a skeptical standpoint, if you already believe stories and myths include important information about what it means to live and how to do so as well as you might, you can likely skip over this. So that's just what we're going to do here: I'll give the <i>briefest</i> of summaries so that you can decide if you're interested in digging in more, but from this point on, I'll assume that you're okay with the premise "the structures of meaning (symbols, narratives, and so forth) within stories and myths give meaningful insights into how the human mind works and how to live a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">meaningful, worthwhile life.</a>" If you don't agree with that premise, I humbly invite you to read my thoughts on finding meaning in life by following that last link.

<p>
At least in vertebrates (and maybe even in invertebrates, hence Peterson's infamous thing with the Lobsters), animals seem to have two groundmost motivational systems: to move toward good things and away from bad things. Moving toward good things produces a bunch of feel-good reward chemicals, like dopamine, and moving away from bad things seems to relieve a bunch of feel-bad chemicals that cause anxiety and stress, like cortisol. This leads to a world full of known good and bad things, to which we more or less know how to react, but then an even wider world of the unknown, which holds vast amounts of both good and bad things. As such, we can react to "the unknown" with either the "moving toward good things" motivational system, or with "moving toward, not away from, bad things" anti-reward system. For beings with things like symbols and narratives (like us), we can somewhat choose how we conceptualize of the known and unknown in order to get more of what we want and less of what we don't - are we being forced out into the darkness full of monsters ready to eat us by harsh necessity? Or are we striding into a realm of possibility, ready to handle any obstacles along the way? The former will produce a lot of anxiety and little sense of reward/meaning, whereas the latter will feel full of reward/meaning with minimal anxiety.

Got it? Hooray, we just covered roughly the first 13 chapters out of 68 of <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (~84 pages of 469).

<h3 id="org754b0cb">Peterson's Biggest Influences Here are Jung and Nietzsche</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org754b0cb">
<p>
The next big thing to get out of the way before we talk about the framework itself is that Peterson is first and foremost a synthesizer. He'll be the first to admit that most of the ideas he shares are outgrowths and remixes of the thinking of folks he admires. He has a <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/">big ol' recommended reading list</a> if you want to delve deeper into where his thinking is coming from.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing to know, though, is that Peterson's method of analyzing myth is about 80-90% Jung, with a good seasoning of Nietszche, and then finished out with his other influences. In other words, I mainly think of "Peterson's" analytical framework for myths as a very helpful introduction/guide to understanding myths from a Jungian standpoint. The framework below relies on Jung's concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">"archetypes"</a>, patterns of behavior, symbolism, and association that appear to be very deeply embedded in human brains and that show up in a variety of forms across many cultures and throughout time. For example, the father in the story of the Prodigal Son, Jupiter of Roman myth, and Mufasa from the Lion King all share characteristics of the "Father" archetype - they act in ways fathers often act, they symbolize things fathers tend to symbolize, and they are associated with things fathers tend to be associated with, and in all three case, those actions, symbols, and associations have a lot in common (controlled/protective aggression, warmth and indulgence to children, enforcer of rules, and so forth). Where I think Peterson is helpful is in giving an underlying conceptual framework for how the different archetypes interact with each other in a more systematic way than Jung was willing or able to do (more on the pros and cons of this in a second).
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche maybe does less to create the shape of the framework or the pieces within it, but his thinking and ethos underlie a lot of the application and interpretation of that framework. You might say that Peterson's whole project here, most of all the bit we skipped over so blithely above, with the biological grounding, is a thoroughly Nietzschean undertaking. Nietzsche rather forcibly pointed out "hey guys, if you don't really believe in God, why are you still doing the stuff he told you to? Maybe we should figure something else out instead." Peterson went "huh, but here we are, more than a century later, still doing that stuff - what's driving that? Even if we don't intellectually believe in God, is there something else going on?" So that's why it's helpful to have Nietzsche in mind, even if most of the book is far more directly influenced by Jung (who was, of course, himself influenced heavily by Nietzsche). To put it briefly, the thesis of the book might be something like "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?"

<h4 id="orgbc9e96c">A Quick Word about Abstraction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbc9e96c">
<p>
Alright, so here we are for the main event. First, a word about abstraction. This model is an example of an abstraction - you might even argue an abstraction of abstractions. What do I mean by abstraction? Here, at least, I mean a general label you generate to explain what several specific instances have in common. So, you read the Prodigal Son, you hear a few myths about Jupiter, and you watch the Lion King. You notice that the father figures in these stories have some things in common. You also think about all of the actual fathers you have known in your life -  your own, your friends', your own experience with your children, and so forth. You notice that some of the things the story-fathers have in common are also shared, mostly, by these real-life fathers. At this point, you have dozens of specific data points, but if you want, you can take the things that all of them (or at least most of them) have in common and call that the "Father abstraction". No one of these individual fathers will 100% match this abstraction, but all of them will match at least a little, and all of them will match the Father abstraction more closely than, say, the Mother abstraction. So far, so good, right?
</p>

<p>
Well, what if what you're interested in is the difference between widowed fathers, and fathers married to natural mothers, and fathers married to step mothers? Now, the unifying "fatherness" between these three categories is maybe helpful, but much less so, because it hides the very distinction you want to pay attention to. Or, what if you're interested in the story of your own father, the actual, individual human being? All of his nuance and idiosyncracy. Well, now what he has in common with other fathers is almost useless, because you want to know precisely about what is unique to him - even if he still exhibits almost all of the traits of the "Father Abstraction".
</p>

<p>
I bring all this up to make clear something about Peterson's approach. There's a general rule with abstractions - the more widely they can be applied, the less accurately the represent any given instance of the abstraction. Let's think about maps. Imagine you have a military-style grid map that covers an area of roughly 500 square kilometers (10 x 5) with a 10 meter contour interval (there are topographical lines on the map showing changes of elevation of 10 meters). This is a fairly detailed map -  you can successfully use it to find your way through the woods pretty well if the changes in elevation are distinct enough, or with the help of a compass. Now imagine we zoom out to a map that is roughly 5,000 square kilometers and shows changes in elevation at 100 meter intervals. This map covers a wider area, which is certainly useful, but you're going to have a much harder time working out if you're in <i>this</i> tiny draw or <i>that</i> one. The zoomed-out map tells you about more places, but it tells you less about all of those places than a more zoomed-in map would tell you about any one of them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> tends to work down to some pretty granular "abstractions" - some of the entries may only cover a handful of specific instances, but they analyze what those have in common in a lot of detail. Peterson, on the other hand, zooms way out to try to arrive at the six(ish) archetypes that explain <i>every story ever told</i>. This insight struck me when I was thinking about why I was so irritated by this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve">condescending review of Peterson and specifically Maps of Meaning from Current Affairs</a>. Setting aside the other unfair things this article does, what's relevant to this post is that it makes fun of the diagrams in <i>Maps of Meaning</i> for being so simplistic as to be meaningless. I would argue, instead, they are at the high end of abstraction in order to apply as widely as possible. The good news is that the framework these diagrams represent can be applied to almost any story. The bad news is that without familiarity with a broad set of instances to which that framework applies, it doesn't do much to help you. Imagine that you had never reflected much about the symbolic role of "fathers" in stories or the kinds of roles "fathers" tend to play in real life. Now, imagine someone says to you "okay, so what we're looking at here is clearly an instance of the Father archetype" - if you haven't ever connected the specific instances you've encountered to that abstraction, it's not going to do you much good at all. I think that's part of why <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (and Peterson's lectures) is so sprawling - he sees the abstraction linking many instances, but he realizes that not everyone he's speaking to does, so he's desperately trying to cram a wide survey of specifics into your mind so that the generality abstracted from them will mean something to you.

<h4 id="org80e03e3">Order, Chaos, and the Mediator</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org80e03e3">
<p>
Based on the biological grounding that we so blithely skipped over above, Peterson argues that our perception of the world, at a very fundamental level, is sorted into stuff that we treat as pretty much settled (Order), stuff that hasn't been explored and could be anything (Chaos), and how we feel about those things, right now, and in general (the Mediator). Order is symbolically masculine (if your hackles are hackling, see the aside below), Chaos is symbolically feminine, and the Mediator is <i>almost</i> neuter, as what's most important about the Mediator is usually being the <i>child</i> of a symbolically masculine and symbolically feminine force. That being said, our history being what it is, most stories have been about dudes, so the Mediator is usually depicted as a guy, with some flavoring of symbolic masculinity. The other important thing to keep in mind is that both Order and Chaos tend to be "static" until the Mediator interacts with them. Even if there's a lot of "change" within Chaos, it's not <i>significant</i> change - it's "sound and fury, signifying nothing". Think of a pot of water boiling - lots of movement, no real change. Until you put the pasta in!

<h5 id="org7e427f5">A Quick Aside on Gender</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7e427f5">
<p>
Okay, I know gender is a hot topic these days, so I want to make a few things clear about the very simplified presentation here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The symbolic "masculine" and "feminine" here described are <i>not</i> one-to-one with our biological sex, or even the gender we identify with. Everyone has both masculine and feminine elements within them, and folks like Jung and Peterson argue that to be a fully-developed, healthy person, you need to be comfortable with both, and integrate both wholly into your personality. Whether "masculine" symbolic traits have some fundamental link to male biological sex, and if so, to what degree, is not really important to the functioning of this framework, so if it helps, treat it as wholly arbitrary (see 2 below)</li>
<li>What characteristics get considered "masculine" or "feminine" in this framework are largely derived from looking at lots and lots of myths and seeing what kind of characters are depicted as male and which as feminine. There are a few challenges here: a. the corpus of myths drawn on is almost entirely from the Mediterranean and Europe, from Ancient Egypt through early modern times, and so the myths of other cultures around the world might consistently assign <i>different</i> traits to masculine or feminine archetypes, b. even within the cultures ancestral to the modern West, what gets considered "masculine" and "feminine" has some variation - for example, the Egyptians had a Father Earth and Mother Sky, and to the Germanic folks, the Sun was a beautiful lady and the Moon a macho man. All of which is to say, we're talking in broad brushstrokes here, but ones that are the most useful for understanding the myths and stories of the Ancient Near East, Mediterranean, and Europe through the Early Modern period.</li>

<h4 id="org2727960">The Good Side and the Bad Side of the Three Basic Categories</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2727960">
<p>
Each of the three basic categories (Order, Chaos, and Mediator) has a good side and a bad side. These bring us back to our basic motivational systems that we briefly summarized in the Biological Grounding above (you see why he went to the trouble to make sure you believed him on that stuff?) The good side of each symbol represents what about it draws us toward it and rewards us if we do indeed go there - Good Order provides helpful predictability, Good Chaos provides new possibilities, and the Good Mediator allows for these things to be balanced dynamically, adjusted as needed. The bad side, then, reflects what about these categories causes anxiety if you can't get away with it - Bad Order is controlling and stifling, Bad Chaos is wild and unpredictable, the Bad Mediator is too absorbed in him/herself to balance the others and makes things worse. Putting this Good/Bad valence together with the three basic categories gives us six main archetypes, which Peterson argues represent a fairly complete, coherent view of how the world works and how to find meaning within it.

<h4 id="org7e2ae7f">The Good King and the Tyrant - Order, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7e2ae7f">
<p>
If you've grown up playing D&amp;D like me, and even more so if you've delved into the Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock fiction that inspired its alignment system, you're likely used to thinking of Order as "basically good". Peterson argues this is only half-right. Civilization and society are heavily associated with Order, especially it's good side. The good side of Order is represented by the Good or Just King. Laws basically uphold what is right, good, competent people usually do better than wicked ones, if you need help, there are folks to turn to who can give it, if you have something you need to do, someone can tell you how to do it.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, too much Order, or the wrong sort, or even Order that used to be helpful, but now no longer applies, can all become the bad side of Order, the Tyrant. Laws catch you in a tangled web that makes it impossible to do anything without breaking one of them, folks advance more for knowing which boxes to check and what forms to fill out than from competence, if you need help, only properly licensed, authorized, and monitored officials can help you, and if you have something you need to do, you damn well better do it the way everyone else does, or else. If you have ever navigated an automated customer service menu to try to handle a straightforward request, only to have every choice you try take you back to the same (wrong) answer (or even worse, this happened with a live human slavishly following a script), then you know what Bad Order can look like.

<h4 id="orgb2fd539">The Kind Mother and the Devouring Beast - Chaos, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb2fd539">
<p>
Again, we're facing a bit of bias from the language we use, as we tend to default to "Chaos is bad". The good side of Chaos, the "Kind Mother" archetype, we might instead call "possibility," or "fertility," or even "creativity". The idea is that the only place new things can come from is the unknown, the not-fully-organized, thus, the Chaotic. Good Chaos is also receptive in the good sense - it welcomes you, it responds to your exploration of it, it reveals knowledge and treasures when you ask politely.
</p>

<p>
The bad side of Chaos, the Devouring Beast/Mother, is everything bad about the unknown, the unorganized, the untamed. Beasts in the wilderness, dragons in caves, child-eating witches in gingerbread houses, all of these are manifestations of Bad Chaos. But then, so is the criminal, the outlaw, the raider. Bad Chaos is also receptive in the bad sense - it envelops you, it gives you somewhere to get lost in, it reveals how little you truly know and how insecure your treasures are.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the earth (as in, the ground) plays both of these roles. The earth is where the plants we eat grow out of, where the animals we eat roam, and it holds the water we drink. On the other hand, it's also where forests full of lions, tigers, and bears grow, where outlaws and invaders lurk, and where our bones disappear into when we die. The sea can also play both roles (fish come from it, but you can drown in it).

<h4 id="org05666cb">The Hero and the Villain - The Mediator, Good and Bad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org05666cb">
<p>
Standing between Order and Chaos (whether Good, Bad, or Both) is the individual, the Mediator. This person stands for each of us as we read the story - he makes choices that we can reflect on, undergoes trials that we can sympathize with, and teaches us lessons about achieving goals (or failing to tragically). The Good Mediator is the Hero - an individual who shows wisdom, compassion, generosity, bravery, or any other noble qualities. The Hero recognizes and values the gifts of Good Order and Good Chaos, and bravely confronts the depredations of Bad Order and Bad Chaos. Maybe most importantly, the Hero <i>balances</i> Order and Chaos appropriately - if things have become too rigid, he brings in the rejuvenation of Chaos, if things have become too wild, he brings in the steadying of Order.
</p>

<p>
The Bad Mediator is then, of course, the Villain, the flip side of the same coin. There's a reason for the stereotype of "we're not so different, you and I. . ." - in a good story, the Hero and the Villain <i>do</i> have much in common. Both face an uncertain world full of risks and rewards, both see the interaction of Order and Chaos in their world and try to take some action to put it more to their liking, and both serve to remind us, the reader/listener, <i>what people are like</i>. In many old stories, they are literally brothers. Where the hero displays noble qualities, though, the villain shows some or all of the ignoble: folly, cruelty, selfishness, cowardice, and more. Where the Hero finds balance, the Villain is more likely to tilt things <i>further</i> out of whack, or to swing the pendulum too far the other way. Often, the villain sees only the bad side of one, the other, or both of Order and Chaos. At his worst, the Villain believes that Being itself is wrong and should be undone, the ultimate nihilism.

<h3 id="org2a921c2">A Couple of Examples, to Make this Clear</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2a921c2">
<p>
Alright, so, like I said, the trouble with abstractions is that if you don't have specific instances to link them to, they can be so vague as to be unhelpful. So let's go through a couple of examples.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1c23193" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1c23193">Story/Mythic Example</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c23193">
<p>
One of Peterson's favorite examples, and a film I've come to appreciate more thanks to his exegesis of it, is <i>The Lion King</i>. If you somehow haven't seen it, I suppose I should warn you that here be spoilers. Simba is obviously the Hero, the Good Mediator figure. Mufasa is obviously the Good King/Kind Father, and thus the positive side of Order. Scar kind of plays double duty as the Bad Mediator (Villain), as well as embodying the Tyrant, Bad Order. Nala somewhat takes on the role of Good Chaos by being one hell of a surprise to Simba when she finds him, and starting him on his path back to Pride Rock. And the hyenas are then Bad Chaos (though interestingly, put to work on behalf of Bad Order). The landscape also takes on some of these roles. The Elephant Graveyard, the barren desert that Simba first escapes to, the Pride Lands when they've been screwed up under Scar's rule, all of these are Bad Chaos. The Pride Lands at the beginning and end of the story and the lush paradise Timon and Pumba take Simba to are places of Good Chaos. You can also see how the different archetypes manifest in the same character at different times - young Simba is brave and loyal (Good Mediaor), but full of himself and a bit foolish (Bad Mediator). Teenage Simba is kind and protective of his friends (Good Mediator), but he's deeply afraid and avoids responsibility (Bad Mediator). Adult Simba acknowledges his responsibility and admits what he has done wrong to try to save his people (Good Mediator), but lets himself fall for Scar's manipulations (Bad Mediator). He also shows alternation between how much Chaos and how much Order he represents, and whether it's good or bad. As a rambunctious, rule-breaking child, he embodies Bad(ish) Chaos, but as the one who brings the rains back, Good Chaos. In his desire to boss people around and have his ego flattered ("I Just Can't Wait to Be King!"), he shows Bad Order, but by deposing the Tyrant and restoring just rule to the Pride Lands, he shows Good Order.
</p>

<p>
So, you can see how the application of these archetypes in different ways, and the interplay between them, can lead to a fairly rich and nuanced set of insights into a story.
</p>

<p>
Okay, stories are well and good, but if you're not yet convinced that understanding stories better will help us understand ourselves and how to live our lives better, then an example of how to apply these archetypes to a story like the one above won't do much for you. So, let me run through how we could use these to think about situations in our lives.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you're stuck in a job that makes you miserable. The economy sucks and you're worried about finding another job (Bad Chaos). Your boss is a micromanaging jerk who takes credit for anything good the team does, and passes blame for anything bad (Bad Order). But even worse, the team is a mess - there are no standard procedures to follow, no one knows who is responsible for what, and your boss is constantly dropping surprise last-minute assignments on you (Bad Chaos). You've gotten to the point where you try to avoid as much responsibility as you can and lie about how much work you're doing (Bad Mediator), because trying to do better has just gotten you burned in the past. Your only relief is to spend your weekends either playing video games for hours on end or getting hammered - or both (Bad Mediator).
</p>

<p>
One day, you've had enough, and you decide you're going to put your life back on a track that suits you better (Good Mediator). You realize that one reason you feel stuck is that you don't have the skills you need to get a job somewhere else, so you sign up for a course (Good Mediator). Through the course, you meet some folks who are also looking for work, and you start to hear about opportunities you'd never considered (Good Chaos). You decide that you're going to create a habit of applying to 5 new jobs a week until you find a new one (Good Order). Once you land the new job, you politely, but firmly, tell your boss that you're leaving and it's because this place is terrible (Good Mediator), and you have a very candid exit interview with HR, hoping that maybe the company can be a little better to work for, even if you're gone (Good Order). As you get ready for your first day on the new job, you're a little nervous, but mostly you're excited, because now you know that if it doesn't work out, you can always find something else (Good Chaos).
</p>

<p>
Alright, so that wasn't the most detailed or interesting scenario, but hopefully it gives some idea of how these ideas can play out in your life. More importantly, once you've learned to think that way, you can start analyzing situations in your life through this lens - where do you feel stifled (Bad Order)? Where do you feel overwhelmed by uncertainty (Bad Chaos)? Where do you act like a jerk (Bad Mediator)? Where do you help others out (Good Mediator)? Where do you have helpful routines (Good Order)? Where do you feel excited about unexplored possibilities (Good Chaos)?

<h3 id="org69c4972">Some Shortcomings of Peterson's Way, as I See Them</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org69c4972">
<p>
Having spent all these words laying out why I think Peterson's framework is helpful, you might (rightly) guess that I'm a big fan. Even still, no framework is foolproof, and this one is no exception. For me, the biggest challenge in using this framework is the level of abstraction discussed above - the fact that it can be applied to <i>any</i> story means that it's missing some of the nuance that it might be helpful to highlight. One example: Jung identified the archetype of the Magician/Wise Old Man, and Campbell noticed how very common that figure was in the "Hero's Journey" mythic storyline. Where does the Magician fit in here? Well, he's kinda-sorta Good Chaos, because he deals with the unknown, but he's also kinda-sorta Good Order, because he often provides wisdom and guidance to the young hero, and he's kinda-sorta the mediator because he helps the hero understand and deal with balancing Order and Chaos. The point is, having a "Magician" archetype you can talk about is often helpful, and it doesn't fit as neatly into the higher-level abstraction of Peterson's framework.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps more fundamentally, let's return to the Nietzschean motivation for this whole project in the first place, which we summarized (and somewhat oversimplified) as "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?" This is making a few pretty big assumptions, though: what about the wide swaths of the world that get by just fine with other bases for their morality? What about folks who still have active, meaningful spiritual experiences and don't feel like (the) God(s) is (are) dead at all? In these cases, I think Peterson's analysis still has much to offer, but his need to ground out this analysis in materialistic explanations compatible with a scientific understanding sometimes bleeds through.

<p>
So, here we are. Peterson's framework is fairly high-level, fairly abstract, but because of this, it's pretty versatile. It's a bit like a Swiss Army Knife of story/myth interpretation - in the long run, you might get far more out of a myth or story through other ways of looking into it deeply, but this gives you a handy starting place, especially for those stories that otherwise seem opaque. Is there a female character? Maybe she represent Chaos, Good, Bad, or mixed. Can the main character's actions be interpreted as balancing Order and Chaos? What about representatives of Order - are they acting more just and protecting, or more tyrannical and controlling? I like to think of this method as a kind of prybar for getting into the underlying meaning of a story - it might not help you fully unpack it, but it can almost always help you get started.

So, I'm getting close on my "Hail Idun", but I can tell I'm not <i>right</i> there yet.
Divination has suggested that I ought to go with a single stanza of Galdralag
(two four-line half stanzas), and a few of the images/themes I should/shouldn't
include. These poems/prayers are highly personal, but I'm also trying to make
sure they work for other folks, so I'm going to share three variants I'm
thinking over below, and I'd very much welcome your thoughts on what bits work,
what don't, and what I might change. As I've said before, whatever I land on for
this prayer will be the beating heart of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, so I want to get it
right.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-opening_thoughts_on_beauty">

</p>

<p>
This is very much a "start writing to work things out and see where takes you"
kind of post, or even more so, series of posts, I'm sure. The more I think about
and reflect on the role of aesthetic taste in questions of meaning, metaphysics,
and even ethics, the more weighty it seems to be. I know that it's far from an
original thought to be like "whoah, maybe beauty is a transcendental virtue" (as
in, "Plato talked about this, and it wasn't new then" unoriginal). Even still,
it's a line of thinking I'm trying to work out for myself, and I think maybe
talking it over with you will help with that. Hopefully you'll at least bear
with me, and with any luck, I'll share something you find helpful.
</p>

<p>
In my head, this feels like a coherent, even simple idea, but whenever I find
myself trying to explain it, I see that it is actually huge, messy, and touches
nearly everything else. I had been thinking I should read more about this and
wait to write about it until I had digested more folks' thoughts, but one of the
things I'm trying to make myself do with these weekly blog posts is to do more
of my thinking "out loud", both since it lets me get more feedback from others,
but also since it makes me get it down in some more-or-less definite form, which
often makes it clear where my thinking is fuzzy, derivative, or otherwise not
what I'd like it to be. So, here's my attempt at a short version: our sense of
what is aesthetic, what is beautiful, what is pleasing is <i>central</i> to our ability
to sort out what is best and most meaningful in life. It's not the <i>only</i> thing
around that, but it's one of the very weighty things.
</p>

<p>
What do I mean by this, exactly? If you have a philosophy that makes good sense
to you and you can back up logically, but it leaves you cold, it's almost
certainly <i>not</i> your path to a truly meaningful and good life. Likewise, if there
is something that stirs you deeply, but you can't truly say why, you likely
ought to follow it. I suspect, but don't yet have any way to make my case, that
our sense of what "looks right" or "feels right" or "is beautiful" is a very
deep synthesis of many factors, including some that are very important, but very
hard to access consciously. An analogy I can draw on from experience: if you've
ever learned to draw human bodies, then there are certain proportions in a
drawing that you will just expect to see, and if you don't, you'll be like
"something is wrong with this drawing, I don't like it". On the other hand,
there are certain ways real human proportions can be exaggerated or manipulated
for pleasing artistic effect (think the giant eyes that anime borrowed from
Disney cartoons). With enough muscle memory of drawing correctly proportioned
anatomy, getting the proportions wrong just "feels" off, even if you can't say
exactly why. Now, you might argue that such drawing doesn't carry much moral or
spiritual weight, and you're likely right, but it's a very clear cut example of
somewhere that a lot of internalized knowledge due to practice, observation, and
feedback leads to a situation where that internalized knowledge is perceived as
"it just doesn't feel right". I suspect that most aesthetic perception of the
sort "I dunno, I just like it" or "that just sounds off to me" is, in fact, the
same kind of deeply internalized knowledge from repeated exposure and judgment.
</p>

<p>
One nice thing about this way of thinking about aesthetics is that it helps us
get around the always-present and always-thorny problem of "what about sexual
attraction, though?" If you haven't run into this, here's how it goes: "The idea
of 'beauty' is clearly somehow related to the concept of sexual attraction, but
there are beautiful things that have nothing to do with sex, so what gives?"
This is an especially telling point if your primary basis for understanding
aesthetics, or even all of human psychology, is an evolutionary one, where sex
gets the starring role. So how does my proposal above address this? Well, if we
take "aesthetic judgment" to mean something like "the qualitative feeling that
something you observe is suitable or not suitable to the purpose for which
you're evaluating it, whether or not you can articulate the drivers for that
judgment," then all of a sudden the link between sexual attraction and aesthetic
beauty becomes easy to define. If a judgment of something as aesthetically
"beautiful" is the positive feeling you get for something that you're pretty
sure will "work", even if you don't know why, then seeing someone that will
"work" for you sexually, even if you can't articulate why, will present in a
very similar way. Add in the fact that the sex drive is super important to most
folks, and this becomes an area of aesthetic judgment that almost everyone
exercises every day, all the time. So, by this logic, it's not that aesthetic
beauty is some ramification or epiphenomenon of sexual attraction, it's that
your judgment of sexual attractiveness is just your best exercised aesthetic
muscle (if you're anything like most folks).
</p>

<p>
Okay, my thoughts could go a lot of different directions from here, but that
actually got me to a new conclusion (I hadn't worked out that judgment of sexual
attractiveness is a <i>subset</i> of aesthetic judgment, rather than something
foundational or ancestral to it). So, I think I'll wrap things up for now. Some
directions I'd like to go here: what to make of evil aesthetic judgments (it is
<i>pleasing</i> to torture this person)? Can you arrive at ethically defensible
positions without bringing in aesthetics? Can aesthetics lead you astray? What
role have aesthetic judgments played in my own spiritual growth? All these and
more lead me to want to write many more posts, but I have no idea when they'll
come out.

<p>
Today is my birthday, so I'm going to go ahead and take one of my "steadholders"
for the year. I had hoped to get a new take on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_hail_idun_prayer">Hail Idun</a> prayer in
Germanish meter, but my first few drafts aren't doing it for me, and since
it will be the beating heart of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I want to get it right.
Instead, a few things I've been thinking about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>38 truly feels a lot closer to 40 than 37, but even that was "not my
'mid-thirties' anymore." I've always sought to not get too hung up on youth
and my age, and to know and accept my own looming death, but it didn't fully
hit me until 2018 when my mother passed away and my first daughter was born
within a couple of months of each other. That was one hell of a shot of
"you're only one step in the ongoing march of life" all at once.</li>
<li>My older daughter is doing her bit to make me feel the full weight of
growing older. Yesterday, she asked me "Daddy, are you an old man?" and I
said "no, not yet, but I'm on my way there." So, she said "will you be an
old man tomorrow?" and again "no, not just yet." "Well, when will you be an
old man?" "Not for a while, honey."</li>
<li>More earnestly, my deepening spiritual work has been a big help with
acknowledging and dealing with my feelings about getting older. I truly
don't know where I'd be had the last few years gone otherwise. These days,
my only regret is that I didn't find this path sooner, but I keep telling
myself it's not a race, there's no prize for "doing more," it's not about
what's at the end of the path, it's all about walking it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With that said, I put forth my blessings to you and hope the coming year treats
you wonderfully.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-thoughts_on_the_way_of_the_rose">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-February-05
</p>

<p>
The very first book that I dug into after my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year with dead writers</a> was <i>The
Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine Feminine Hidden in the Rosary</i> by
Clark Strand and Perdita Finn. Someone had spoken well of it on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/183049.html?thread=29927177#cmt29927177">Magic Monday</a>
over on JMG's dreamwidth journal, and it sounded like it would be
helpful to me in my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> work. Overall, I found the book helpful and
thought-stirring, but below, I share my thoughts in more depth.
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the book makes the case that the Rosary is a very helpful tool
for spiritual growth and healing that need not be only for Catholics, or even
Christians. The book is written with one chapter for every bead on a stock
Rosary, and the chapters are grouped by the old mysteries (so no "Luminous
mysteries"). Through these chapters, the writers put forth that the Rosary
represents a very, very old strand of Goddess worship squelched by the church
that nevertheless found its way into folks' daily practice. They give some
slightly changed ways of saying the prayers to make them a bit more welcoming
for those who are not Christians. They also give some thoughts on how to pray,
such as getting together in "Rosary Groups". The bulk of the book speaks of the
writers' own spiritual paths with the Rosary: coming to it through
"coincidences" and visions, deepening connection with it, and some "whoah, this
[stuff] works" moments. Along the way, they talk about how the Rosary came to be
and what has happened with it, of the Church, of religion more broadly, and
their own backgrounds in spiritual seeking. If any of this sounds like it might
be interesting, read on!
</p>

<p>
I said at the start that my goal in reading this book was to deepen my
understanding of the Rosary as a step on the way to crafting my "Heathen
Rosary", and weirdly enough, this book might as well have been written for that
very end. Okay, okay, not <i>wholly</i> that, but their way of talking about the Rosary
was remarkably helpful to me in a few ways. First, the weight they put on the
Rosary as a way of getting a hold of the "Divine Feminine", but matched with
calls to the "Divine Masculine", lined up with one of my gut-feelings about what
makes the Rosary work so well. Next, my way of working has been to "back-craft"
the Rosary, to work on understanding what makes it tick beyond "it's
contemplation while saying the same prayers over and over with beads to keep
track". As such, their use of a <i>almost</i> the stock Rosary, but with a <i>very</i> unalike
theological understanding and goal, meant that a lot of their insights were
worthwhile to me. Lastly, the book highlights the slow, steady insight and
wisdom that comes from ongoing work, even if you don't know why/how/whether it's
working, which matches how spiritual practice has worked out for me so far.
</p>

<p>
To take these as they were named, the first thing was weighty enough to show up in the
under-name (subtitle) of the book: the Rosary is a way of getting in
touch with the "Divine Feminine." While this was one of the main
ways the book was helpful to me, it also touches on one of the book's biggest drawbacks for me, which is that the writers seem to believe something like "all Goddesses are one Goddess". As such, they see worship of
mother Goddesses in the paleolithic caves of France, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and
praying the Rosary all as unalike ways of giving prayer and worship to the same holy Being. This
is what is sometimes called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LSd3iLCUtU">soft polytheism</a>, which I think is
likely an overly shallow take on what's going on in the spiritual world. This hurdle is fairly readily dealt with, but
it's also there throughout the whole book.  Even so,
I think they rightly mark out some threads of what worship for feminine
beings is like and bring those threads out clearly in the Rosary and what it has
to teach. What kind of things do I mean? Things like kindness, forgiveness, open-heartedness, and
wisdom. The book doesn't highlight as much the matching (not to say equal weight)
between the masculine and feminine held in the Rosary. Each decade of ten "Hail Marys" opens
with an "Our Father" and closes with a "Glory Be" (which calls upon the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost) - so you can see that Mary (the feminine) is very
much at the heart of the practice, but with a weighty masculine match. I
think it likely that this is a weighty bit of what makes the Rosary so mighty
spiritually, and I want to have the same overall take for my Heathen Rosary.
</p>

<p>
Next, this book is indeed helpful for my "back-crafting" work, since it takes the Rosary earnestly, but is not bound by Catholic theology or
doctrine. This opens the writers up to insights about how it works and what it's
doing that a Catholic might either not heed or else make match up with the overall shape of their
set of beliefs. For one ready showdeal, the set of prayers for the Rosary given in the book
leaves out the Apostle's Creed at the beginning, because that is a downright
affirmation that "yes, I believe the things Christianity has to teach" and puts
the whole prayer in that framework. A Catholic likely deems that a needful
bit, where Strand and Finn see it as a "lock" put on the gate to keep
out those the Church wouldn't want saying "its" prayer. Likewise, in talking through the
mysteries to be contemplated while praying the Rosary, a Catholic like de
Montford will strongly ground them in the wider framework of Catholic theology, with
a lot of steering on what a right understanding of each mystery might be.
This work, on the other hand, looks at the mysteries as one set of tales showing
wider spiritual truths. You don't have to believe that 2,000 years ago a Rabbi's
dead body woke up and walked out of a cave to find loveliness, meaning, and Truth of
a less straightforward kind in the tale of the rebirth. I'm most of all thankful
that the writers spelled out how both the mysteries and the words of the "Hail Mary" go from life to suffering to death
to rebirth. I may not want my Heathen Rosary to go through the same steps, but I
do want the same kind of deep, framing resonances between the
prayers themselves and the overall practice. To bring in an
overly-leaned-upon forlikening (metaphor): this book has worked like a Rosetta Stone for the Rosary for
me - rather than needing to translate from Catholic to Heathen with nothing in
between, I can see what translating the Rosary into other spiritual "tongues"
looks like, which is helpful.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the book spoke to a way of coming at spiritual growth that I seem to need to work on -
steadfast, bit-by-bit unfolding of wisdom and insight through ongoing work. To
fully share what I mean, I might have to lay out a bit about myself. Growing
up, I was always a "smart kid" - I understood things quickly, soaked up new
knowledge, and otherwise was ready to do things with my mind. I say
this not to brag, as you'll see, but to highlight that I was (and largely still
am) "brainy", maybe to the harm of other ways of knowing and understanding
the world. This was made painfully clear to me in the aftermath of my mother
passing away from cancer.  Mind-wise, I had settled myself with what had
happened, what it meant to me, how I should think and feel about it, and I
thought I was alright. But I was not alright. My wife at last got me to go talk to a
therapist, and through that and some of my own looking back, I had the insight
that I was so wont to being able to think my way through things, to use my mind
to handle stuff in my life, that I thought my feelings would play by the same
rules, to answer to the same ways of doing things. In the same way that as a kid in math class, after doing a few problems I "got" how to bring to bear the principle
and found further going over boring and unneeded, I thought that reading a few
books, thinking about what happened in a few other folks' lives  meant that I "got" grief
and could go about my business with that little hardship cleanly worked out. As will
no doubt be blindingly clear to you, unless you share the same quirk of which
I've been telling, this is not at all how grief or any other weighty feeling
works. You have to, you know, truly <i>feel</i> it, and that takes time and cannot
be bossed around by the words in your head. What does work is daily, plodding
work, over and over again, whether you're "feeling it" this time or not. Whether
prayer, meditation, journaling, or whatever other spiritual practice, every time
I have buckled down and done it no matter what, <i>that</i> is where I have been gifted
with worthwhile spiritual experiences. The book had a lovely quote on coming at
the Rosary in this way:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Rosary wisdom tends to grow slowly, building gradually over the course of a
lifetime. The rosary isn't a degree program. There are no classes or courses.
There's no diploma at the end. There isn't any end. We never stop accumulating
the wisdom of the rosary. The beads turn, the seasons pass. The experiences of a
lifetime settle within us like fallen leaves and flowers, becoming the top-soil
that nourishes and informs our lives.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Overall, I found this book insightful and helpful, and I'm very glad I read it.
That being said, it won't grab everyone alike. For starters, if the Rosary holds
no spiritual or aesthetic appeal for you, I doubt that this book will change
that. For another, Strand and Clark are coming at this from an openly "feminist"
outlook, which brings along with it ways of framing and understanding things
that you may or may not find helpful. One showdeal is their strong dislike and
wariness of hierarchy, most of all those mostly made up of men, as seen when
they speak rather harshly of "religion" many times in the book. By "religion"
they seem to mean any group with any hierarchy given to spiritual ends. Another
showdeal is that in a few steads they treat masculine ways of understanding or
dealing with the world as childish or mistaken, things that need to be outgrown
or put aside, rather than matched with feminine ways for a healthy whole. For
both of these showdeals, they share things they have lived through that make it
rather understandable how they would come to this way of looking at the world,
including some truly wretched dealings with so-called spiritual teachers, but I
still think they've "learned too much" from those happenings. Lastly, they speak
in rather apocalyptic words about the way the world is going - it's not so much
that I doubt things things are going to go poorly, but rather that I don't
foresee the sudden and utter outcomes held in apocalyptic thinking about what
may come. I think a slow, ragged <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-long-descent-a-user-s-guide-to-the-end-of-the-industrial-age-john-michael-greer/15681939?ean=9781945810282">descent</a> is a far more likely forecast.
</p>

<p>
So, if you'd like to learn more about the Rosary from a truly not-Christian
way of looking at the world, or maybe work at understanding some of what folks have
found in praying the Rosary, this book's a great way to do that.

</p>

<p>
In my ongoing work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I hit upon the thought that I ought to have something much like the Christian "Sign of the Cross" - a quick prayer and bodily token of self-blessing and warding. As with much of this undertaking, I started from the thought that Christian, most of all older kinds of Christian, tradition has much that works well, and maybe it doesn't <i>only</i> work for Christian beliefs. The things that drew me to the Sign of the Cross were 1. it is rather short, 2. in that short length, it calls upon a whole, balanced holiness, and 3. it is linked with energy centers in the subtle body. These hallmarks let the Sign of the Cross be something that Christians use both day-to-day (before and after longer prayers, when coming to the altar, and so forth) and also "as needed", such as coming across something dreadful or grasping that a statement ought to have been a prayer.
</p>

<p>
So, I set about coming up with such a short prayer-with-gesture that works for my own beliefs and worship. What I came up with largely came from intuition, meditation, prayer, and divination. I haven't tested it out much yet, so if anyone else finds this helpful, I'd love to hear from you. Let me break down how I matched up the bits I laid out above:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To make it short, I settled on <i>Galdralag</i> <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">meter</a>. I also tried out some others, such as four lines of <i>Anglo-Saxon Long Lines</i>, but those felt a bit long for what I was looking for.</li>
<li>To get a whole, balanced likeness of the spiritual world, I began with the thought of the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. As I worked on this and meditated, though, it came to me to instead focus mainly on the three wells from which the World Tree's roots drink - in Old Norse, <i>Hvergelmir</i>, <i>Mimisbrunnr</i>, and <i>Urdabrunnr</i> (more on these below when I talk about the words I picked).</li>
<li>For the energy centers, I drew on those marked out in John Michael Greer's Druidic magical systems, such as that laid out in his <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>. These are the "womb center" about an inch below the belly button, the "third eye" between the eyebrows, and the heart center (unsurprisingly, at the heart).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again, I got to much of this in a way I can't wholly spell out in a way I can back up, but it feels pretty strong to me nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
So, what of the prayer itself? As I said, I used <i>Galdralag</i>, and here's what I came up with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
From seething hwer<sup>1</sup>,<br />
Woden's drink,<br />
and Wyrd's holy well,<br />
Mighty tree unmatched.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>1 An Old English word meaning "boiler, cauldron"</i>
</p>

<p>
A few thoughts on the words I picked. First, "hwer" was a bit of an odd one, but I couldn't land on a translation of <i>Hvergelmir</i> I liked much. <i>Hwer</i> is the direct cognate with Old Norse <i>hver</i>, a word for a pot or a kettle. The <i>gelmir</i> bit is cognate with "yelling", but "Yelling Pot" just doesn't have much of a ring to it in English, to say nothing of making the alliteration work. The sense of <i>Hvergelmir</i> seems to be something like churning rapids, or a steaming, boiling hot spring. "Woden's Drink" is a pretty straightforward kenning for Meomer's (<i>Mimir's</i>) Well, the well of wisdom that Woden gave his eye to drink from. Wyrd's holy well is, of course, the Old Norse <i>Urdhabrunnr</i>, Wyrd being a direct cognate for <i>Urdh</i>. The "mighty tree unmatched" is, also of course, the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how I've been doing it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take 2 fingers and put them about an inch below your belly button and say "From seething hwer,"</li>
<li>Move your fingers to the spot between your eyebrows and say "Woden's drink,"</li>
<li>Move your fingers to your heart and say "and Wyrd's holy well, Mighty tree unmatched."</li>
</ol>

<p>
This ought to work for Heathens who'd like an all-around self-blessing/warding to say before and/or after prayer, when running into wicked things, and so forth. I'll start using it, and I'll let you know what I find out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-list_of_books_on_germanish_belief_with_thoughts">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2023-January-22

<p>
I very much like when a writer shares not only the books that they read, but also what they think of them - an "annotated bibliography". I may not have a book of my own (yet), but I do have a big ol' list of books I have read or want to read on Germanish belief, and I thought I'd share it. As I get to the books I haven't read on this list, I might come back and add my thoughts on them. If you know of any books you think ought to be on the list, kindly let me know! For now, I'll share my thoughts either from reading the book, or what I know about it that makes me want to read it.
</p>

<p>
Also, it ought to go without saying, but given the times we live in, I'll say it anyhow: my putting a book on the list below does not mean I agree with it in whole or in part - it only means that I think it might have some insights on understanding the field it's about.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7df0878">
<p>
These are the elder works that everything else builds upon. Mostly written down by Christians, and mostly written sometime after folks worshiped the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, we are nevertheless lucky to have far more to work with than the beliefs of many other lands. These works show us a tantalizing glimpse of the wider world of Gods, Goddesses, elves, dwarves, and other wights that the folks of Germanish lands lived in before the coming of Christianity.

<b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes, more than once, from many translators<br />
<b>Thoughts</b>: This is <i>the</i> book to read on Old Norse mythology. If you read nothing else, read this one. Helpfully put-together and makes good sense, maybe <i>too</i> much sometimes, but most of the "summaries of Old Norse Mythology" below are mostly restatements of this.

<b>Thoughts</b>: In many ways, this is even more grounded than <i>The Prose Edda</i>, but it's harder to follow if you haven't already read Sturlusson's learned summary. Jackson Crawford's translation is helpfully literal, Lee Hollander's has a delightful Germanish taste thanks to the words he uses, and Maria Kvilhaug's take in her book <i>Seed of Yggdrasil</i> (see below) gives the meaning of the proper names, which is a big help to understanding.

<b>Thoughts</b>: This is a history of the kings of Norway and Sweden written by the same heavy hitter who gave us the <i>Prose Edda</i>. Though written as a "history," the older bits likely draw on beliefs from before Christianity. For translations, Lee Hollander's is good, but there are very many.

<b>Thoughts</b>: This is the very kind of workhorse book that everyone else is lucky to have when someone goes to the trouble to put it together. It brings together short outcuttings (excerpts) from Classical and Medieval Christian sources on Germanish Heathens (so, pretty much everything other than the Germanish Poetry that we have about the Heathenry of elder times).

Tolkien put it together following the rules of Old Norse/Old English poetic meter in modern English, which makes for a lovely read.

There's a fairly large body of work in Old English, much of it poetry, but all written down by Christians.

<b>Thoughts</b>: One of the many overviews of Old Norse lore. I have to confess that I have many of these, but have not much read them, as I feel like I already know most of what they hold. That being said, besides their main use (helping folks new to the lore get to know it), they are also helpful to more knowledgeable folks since they bring together in one stead what we know of the tales, beliefs, and worship about each God, the evidence for which might be spread across many works of elder times.

<b>Thoughts</b>: A gathering of the thoughts of learned folks on the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. I haven't dug in yet, but an Ecosophia reader spoke well of it.

It seems that Bauschatz mostly uses linguistic evidence to argue that the speakers of Germanish tongues thought about time in a rather unalike way to how we do now or how Roman and Christian writers did, and that we misunderstand what myths meant when we put today's way of looking at time on to them. <i>Very</i> hard to find, but try your nearest university bookhoard.

Enright lays out the evidence that Celtic and Germanish warbands of the <i>volkerwanderung</i> times had a role for a woman as seeress and initiator, and that you can see hints of this throughout the later lore, even as late as Beowulf.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Another book that I started in on and then had to set aside for my year of reading only books by dead writers. Even though the name of this book has the ugly "dwarfs" instead of the lovely and rightful "dwarves", I am very much looking forward to digging back into this book. It seems to shed a lot of light on why it is that elves and dwarves have something to do with barrows and forebearers, which is something I look forward to working out my own take on.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Pollington has become one of my best-loved writers on all things Anglo-Saxon. His work is thorough, with wide-faring citations and careful bringing together of widespread threads. He also strikes a balance between sharing what implications a bit of evidence might have, while being careful to call out what is well-grounded and what is more out-there. This book does a wonderful job of finding the links between the Old English evidence (often scant) and the Nordic lore that is so much more thorough. If your interest in Germanish lore, belief, or worship is at all Anglo-Saxon flavored, this book is well worth your time.

This bit could likely be built out far more, most of all if I ever settle on taking on Old Norse or today's German. For now, this is weighted toward my liking of Old English. Mark also that this bit hold works on Runes as a way of writing rather than as a tool for magic. It's helpful to know that many "serious" folks whose field of learning is the Runes lean toward putting very little weight on their use for magic at all, ever, since they do not wish to be overly linked with folks today who seek to use the runes for magic. Make of that what you will.

<p>
While not straightforwardly about Germanish belief, these works look into what we might know or guess about the forebearers that Germanish folks shared with other folks of Eurasia. These can be a wellspring of surprising insights, but should also be taken with the right amount of salt, for almost the whole field comes from folks going "this thing calls this other thing to mind", whether that be words that sound alike, tales that go along the same lines, or Gods that took similar worship. Professional men and women of learning work very hard to put these likenesses on the strongest footing they might, but at the end of the day, they make a call on what they deem believable and what not, so be careful taking any of their conclusions without giving them your own thought. Mark that if you start going down this path, then works of lore for <i>every other Indo-European folk</i> might have a bearing on what you can work out, but I've deemed those out of scope for this list, lest it grow to even more laughable length.

These books are written by folks who worship the Germanish Gods and/or do magic founded in Germanish ways. Unlike the Learned Works above, these often lean more heavily on what the writers themselves have seen, thought, felt, or done. For folks who want to work out their own way of worshiping or doing magic, these helpfully fill in the gaps left by the Lore

<b>Thoughts</b>: <i>Greatly</i> helpful work on prayers written following the ways of old Germanish poetry. Also holds <i>many</i> prayers written following such ways. A big help if you want to know either a) some prayers you might say to the Germanish Gods, or b) how to write your own prayers as a kind of poetry much like what pre-Christian worshippers used to the same ends.

<p>
As I said above, "shamanism" is a word that gets used for many unalike things, but the ways of the folks who live about the North pole gave us the name, and I think it likely those ways left some mark on the ways of the Norse at least, and maybe the wider Germanish world. The books below are all by Raven Kaldera and/or Galina Krasskova, and they have a way of looking at things that is rather unlike other folks, so take with as much salt as seems right to you.

<b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />

<b>Thoughts</b>: One thing that makes Kaldera somewhat controversial amongst the worshipers of Germanish Gods is his worship of and working with the <i>Jotnar</i>, the "giants" of Norse myth. Most folks see these as hostile or at least indifferent beings, and worship of them as not a good idea, but Kaldera says otherwise.

<h3 id="orgbfe21ef">The Rules</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbfe21ef">
<p>
For all of 2022, I set myself the goal of reading only books by writers who had
died before I began reading it, unless the book was 1. needed for work, 2. about
a hands-on skill that I put to work in 2022, or 3. written by a friend or kin.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad I did it, I think it was good for me, and now I'd like to share a bit
about how it went and what I learned.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6937513" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6937513">What Went Well</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6937513">
<p>
First off, I met my goal, so huzzah! Since I made this boast publicly and told
my friends and family about it, it helped very much whenever I found myself
wanting to bend or break my rules. One of my goals for the year was to read more
old books, and this helped me do so. I also wanted to use it as a spur to read
more "great" or otherwise intimidating books, and it helped me there as well -
among others, I read Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i> (both volumes) and
Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.
</p>

<p>
This also drove me to think more about my reading and where I
might look to answer a question - if I wanted to read about a something, I had
to try to find a book about it by someone who was dead. Brand new field like the
blockchain? Too bad, maybe this isn't the year for cutting edge stuff.
</p>

<p>
When I found myself wanting to read books by living authors, I had to stew on it
for a while. Sometimes I found that my yearning for a book cooled after a few
weeks, but with a handful, I was literally counting the days to the New Year.
I've already read two short books I'd been wanting to get to for months now, and
it felt like a real treat to get to them at last.
</p>

<p>
Another of my main goals was to open myself up to ways of thinking not tangled
up in the trends and prejudices of today. Sure enough, these books were at times
refreshing, shocking, or both.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I think this was great New Year's goal. It could bend to fit my
changing tastes, needs at work, and even having a baby. On the other hand, it
was spelled out well enough to make it easy to know if I was following it or not
and binding enough to get me to act differently than I would have without it. If
any of that grabs you, consider giving a shot sometime.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6085ebf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6085ebf">What Might Have Gone Better</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6085ebf">
<p>
While I think the goal was a good one and the year went well, there were a few
less-thrilling things. First off, I read a <i>lot</i> less: 17 books against 46 in
2021 (not including comics). To be fair to my goal, I don't think it's the only,
or even the main, driver of why I read less - I would put that more on a larger
teaching load, long books to read, a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinet/">note-taking system</a>, and most of all,
having a new baby for the last few months of the year. I also got deeper
into my spiritual practice and took up a bit of leatherworking over the summer,
so there were those as well.
</p>

<p>
Also, and this one might be thanks to my goal, it was much harder for me to get
into most of the fiction I chose. When I really love a novel, I'll pick it up
whenever I get a spare moment, whereas if I merely like it, it'll only get 10-15
minutes before bed, if I don't just fall face first into bed. I also missed
comics and graphic novels. It seems my tastes run much more with the times with
fiction than non-fiction. Of course, there are lots of comics whose authors have
died and every kind of fiction imaginable, but for whatever reason, this bit was
less successful for me.
</p>

<p>
I also could have set my rules more clearly for edge cases: does looking up an
entry in a reference book count? How about finding a saying from something I've
already read? Or checking a book's index for a key word? How about the book I'm
getting meditation themes from? Or an art book where I'm looking at the
pictures?
</p>

<p>
I ended up settling on "referencing" not counting as "reading", and a small
amount of skimming to get the gist of a book was okay, as long as I didn't
linger too long on any bits. I counted meditation themes as "learning a hands-on
skill" and looking at art books didn't count as "reading", though it was a good
reminder to go look for older stuff instead of only looking at the latest art.
</p>

<p>
I felt like all of this was in keeping with my why I set the goal, which was
mostly for books I would read cover-to-cover but I would have felt better about
it if I wasn't asking myself if I was "cheating."
</p>

<p>
Likely the closest I came to fudging the goal was spending a <i>lot</i> of time reading
blogs. Maybe too much time. Maybe time that would have been given to books if
not for the goal.
</p>

<p>
For example, I read the whole archive of <i>Unqualified Reservations</i> and <i>Gray
Mirror</i> by Curtis Yarvin, the former of which includes many series that have been
sold as e-books. I ended up counting it as okay so long as I read it "as a
blog" - in my browser, post-by-post, and in the order they were posted, not how
they were put together for publication.
</p>

<p>
This was more a case of sticking to the letter of my goal while bending the
spirit a fair bit - I spent hours and hours reading long-form prose by living
folks, about the same things I would have read books about if not for my goal.
So, as much as the goal was meant to take away distractions so I could read
stuff I might otherwise put off, reading blogs so much went against that.

<h3 id="org420635b">What I'm Doing This Year</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org420635b">
<p>
This year (2023) I settled on a goal for output instead of input: every week I
will put up a blog post. I'd like to post here to my webstead weekly, but in a
crunch, I will count shorter/less polished pieces on my [dreamwidth journal] as
meeting my goal.
</p>

<p>
The thinking here is to get myself used to writing and sharing it with others
often. If anyone bothers to read it, that's gravy.
</p>

<p>
To meet this goal, I'll be treating the "week" as Monday to Sunday, though I'd
like to get to where I'm posting in the middle of the week anyway and the point
will be moot. Since consistency is my goal, "make up" posts are better than
nothing, but more than 5 will be a loss. Likewise, more than 5 posts that are
<i>only</i> placeholders (like one or two sentences that don't say much worth reading)
will be a loss.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully you'll join me for this trek, and we'll both find it worthwhile!

<p>
I've always liked learning about mythology and religion, but most of my tries at prayer or worship left me cold. I gave it a shot for a bit in college, but by a few years ago, I had pretty well settled into a scientific materialistic atheism, or at least a pretty hard-edged agnosticism - I thought there was nothing reasonable you could say about things that weren't available to the five senses, so why speculate. Then, much to my surprise, about a year and a half ago (mid 2021), I had what seems to have been a pretty classic religious experience. Since then, I've been taking a new look at much of how I think about the world, and it's been a wild ride. At this point, I can still remember how the world looked as a materialist, but now I see things differently. Standing astride these two worldviews, I think I might be able to help out anyone looking across that chasm and wondering what's on the other side, and if it's worth finding a way over.

<p>
The reader I have in mind for this post is someone with a pretty firm grounding in how the world works - likely you know a basic outline of history, some understanding of physics and biology, and enough psychology that folks' day-to-day foibles don't surprise you too much. Maybe one of these fields grabs you more, and you've gone deeper there, but basically, you don't look at history, or technology, or politics and feel totally perplexed. Things may not be where you'd like, but they at least make sense. Amongst all of that, though, something's under-developed: a sense of meaning. Very likely you've read some philosophy, some self-help, maybe you've tried out meditation or gratitude journaling or the like. If your mostly-good-enough worldview falls short precisely at the most important questions ("what's it all about?", "what should I do with my life?", and so forth), then I hope this post might help you out.

<h4 id="orge35eaca">By "Spiritual", I Mean Whatever Makes Life Worth Living</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge35eaca">
<p>
Before we go further, I wanted to pin down what I mean by "spiritual," since I'll be talking about it a lot below. Trying to define "spiritual" or "spirituality" is notoriously tough, so I'm going to go with an open-ended definition for this post. When I say "spiritual" (in this post at least), what I mean is whatever beliefs, experiences, and practices that strengthen the feeling that life is fundamentally good and worth living over the long-term. That last bit is important, because otherwise we might rope in a lot of short-term enjoyable experiences, like drugs or casual sex, that few folks would give much weight to as "spiritually significant". Also, I use the word "strengthen", because I don't think many things are well-served by a binary of "spiritual/not-spiritual." Maybe having an enchanting encounter with an attractive member of your preferred sex is "spiritual" if you've been feeling cold and lonely, but it is likely to be less spiritually weighty than building a life-long partnership with someone and raising a family. So, for my definition, "spiritual" is continuous, not categorical.

<div id="outline-container-org224ce09" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org224ce09">Start From Where You Are</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org224ce09">
<p>
The most important thing on the spiritual path is to take your own experience seriously. Questions of meaning and spiritual significance are deeply personal, and your answers are likely to be even more so. First, take stock of why you're even asking these questions - are you feeling bitter, depressed, or angry? Is life going "fine", but it feels like something is missing? Are there niggling little edges of your model of the world that don't quite work? Have you had an experience you can't wholly explain? Wherever you're starting, be honest with yourself. Folks often use "I'm just being honest" as an excuse to be overly harsh, even towards themselves. So don't do that, but also don't try to pretend everything is fine if it isn't. 
</p>

<p>
Wherever you and your beliefs are, though, there are very likely things you can do to move your life toward something you like better. If you just can't take religious claims as anything other than wishful thinking for stupid people, if you try to pray or do rituals, it's going to feel hollow and dumb. So, if that's you, don't start there. Maybe something like reading philosophy and meditating on it could work for you. Maybe even that feels too "woo woo" for you: if so, try looking for some scientifically validated practices like gratitude journaling or getting regular exercise. If you feel like your mental/emotional state could be better, you're almost certainly right, but your path to get there is unlikely to be the same as anyone else's. Down the way, it might take you to some funky places, but for now, you have to start from where you are.

<h4 id="org267a389">Find Credible Folks Rather than Believable Claims</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org267a389">
<p>
Okay, let's imagine that you've taken a good, hard look at your life and what you believe about it, and you're thinking something like "this isn't quite working for me."
</p>

<p>
So, you settle on widening your outlook, and you start reading some folks outside of your comfort zone - self-help gurus, philosophers, religious folks, maybe even occultists. As you do, you run into things that leave you scratching your head at best or scoffing in disbelief at worst. One of the pitfalls of spiritual writers, especially alternative spiritual writers, is a whole lot of "woo". If you're coming from any kind of rationalist background, it's easy to run into stuff that you just can't take seriously at all. They are operating from an <i>utterly</i> different epistemological/metaphysical basis, and they take for granted things about the world that seem obviously wrong to you. You end up finding yourself in a wilderness of wild claims about how the world works and what might make your life better. Let's take a common example: most religious folks believe in the actual, external reality of one or more sentient beings that happen not to have bodies (Gods, angels, spirits, and so forth). If you are coming from a materialist viewpoint, this claim is patently nonsense. Those religious people then claim that talking to some of these non-physical beings can make your life much better. So, how do you handle this recommendation to start praying?
</p>

<p>
Here's my take: look for writers that you find credible about <i>something</i>, and work on holding off judgment on the weirder, woo-woo-ier stuff they talk about. Look for fields where their judgment and reasoning make sense to you. Over time, you might find yourself going "this person is smart, grounded, and reasonable about just about everything, why does he believe this crazy stuff?" With a truly open mind, that's a helpful stead to find yourself in. If you think about it, you pretty much do this all the time -  everyone you know has a quirky set of beliefs about the world, some of which you'll hold with and some you won't. For one easy example, I'm willing to bet you have someone among your friends or kinsfolk that you like and think well of, but with whom you will <i>not</i> talk politics.
</p>

<p>
So, when weighing the worth of spiritual writers, look at those of their beliefs about the world which you <i>can</i> more readily evaluate. Do they talk about history, or politics, or psychology, or literature, or other non-spiritual matters? Do they make sense when they do? The goal here is to ask yourself "does this person seem trustworthy overall?" If they seem nuts about everything, chances are good they're nuts about spiritual matters too. On the other hand, if they seem like calm, thoughtful folks with a clear outlook on the world, and yet they happen to believe something that seems obviously impossible to you, well, now that's interesting, isn't it? These are the folks you'll want to pay attention to.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd289a40">
<p>
Since the definition we're using for spirituality here grounds out in how you live your life, there's a helpful rule of thumb you can apply to would-be spiritual teachers that comes from one of the best-known spiritual teachers of all time, Jesus: "by their fruits ye shall know them." In other words, look at what kind of outcomes this guy has in his own life. How does he treat others? Is he surrounded by scandal? Is his life a raging dumpster fire? It's always helpful to think through these questions when taking someone's advice, but it's even more weighty for philosophical or spiritual things, since their <i>whole point</i> is making your life better. Look out for folks who seem to make sense, but whose lives are a mess.

<h4 id="org385e1cb">Consciousness is Not Available to the Five Senses</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org385e1cb">
<p>
One rationalist argument that I always found convincing was that you can't meaningfully reason about things that are not available to the five senses. In other words, if there are things about the world that we can't experience with our senses, we have no way of knowing about them for sure, so we shouldn't bother speculating. Further, since the world can seemingly be explained pretty darn well by those things that <i>are</i> available to the senses, it's very likely extraneous to assume there's anything else. This <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=161">post</a> by Eric S. Raymond is a good example of that kind of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
I was pretty comfortable with such reasoning until I read <i>A World Full of Gods</i> by John Michael Greer. He made a point that blew a big hole in that comfortable line of reasoning. We <i>do</i> in fact have an important element of experience that is not available to the five senses: the contents of our consciousness. Thoughts, imaginations, emotions. These are obviously important parts of our experience, but they are not accessible to anyone's senses. The typical materialist explanation is that these experiences are just epiphenomena of the matter in our skulls, but that "just" is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting. If there's one hugely important area of our experience that is <i>not</i> amenable to the five senses, then there might be others. One area worth giving some consideration is one that every single human culture we have a record of (except ours recently) has found self-evident: the reality of spiritual beings.

<h5 id="orgf7028a9">Reason is a Helpful Tool, but Some Things are Subjective</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgf7028a9">
<p>
What all of the above led me to is that reason is an incredibly helpful tool, but it's not the end-all, be-all for understanding the world and our experience of it. If you begin any kind of spiritual practice, even just journaling or meditating, you will run into a lot of experiences that you can't verify or validate with other folks - they will be wholly subjective to you. Some of those wholly subjective experiences might feel tremendously important, but you won't be able to <i>confirm</i> them empirically or through formal rationality. Does that mean you should ignore them or discount them?

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3b099bf">
<p>
Okay, the above points were about the sources you check out and how you think about them, but this one is for you. From my own experience, what you think is true about the world is <i>much</i> less important than what you do. You might believe that it's great to treat everybody with loving-kindness, but if you keep acting like a dick, that's not worth much. I have some thoughts on what practices might be most helpful, but the core idea is <i>regular practice</i> - pick something you think will be good for you to do, and then do it every day. Meditation is a good choice, but there are others - like a gratitude journal, volunteering, yoga, prayer, and more. The okay thing you will do regularly is way better than the great thing you give up on.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org229f6c4">
<p>
Some folks say that you should give spiritual practices a shot even if you don't believe they're "really real." Something like "pray even if you don't think anyone is listening." In my case, a few years back, I was convinced that rituals and spiritual practices were a useful way to get in touch with the archetypes of the unconscious, but I thought it was "all in my head." It seems that this works for some folks (see this <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html">post</a> from Eric S. Raymond for one example). So I tried it out - I called on Gods, did rituals, and so forth, but all while believing their "reality" was something wholly metaphorical. I felt silly. I couldn't get past feeling like I was talking to myself, so even though I kept at it for a while, it never stopped feeling like an empty waste of time. All of this is to say, if you can't get yourself to at least thinking "maybe there's somebody/something else out there," you might not have much luck with more explicitly religious practices like prayer, and maybe you should start with something else, like meditation.

As I've stressed above, any grappling with spiritual matters you do will be deeply your own, and thus what works for you won't be what works for others.

<h4 id="org5d015a5">Existentialism Says to Make Your Own Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5d015a5">
<p>
I've listed existentialism first, as it begins with a presupposition wholly in keeping with modern materialism: nothing is meaningful <i>in and of itself</i>. Instead, it is up to you to work out what is meaningful to you and why that matters. It can be a harsh pill to swallow, and it's one that I have since found doesn't meet my own spiritual needs, but existential thinkers tend to approach the problems with meaning with brutal clarity and how to tackle them with admirable courage. The single best work here has got to be <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> by Viktor Frankl. Nothing quite like a holocaust survivor's tale to put life's problems in perspective.

<h4 id="orge9cb5d9">Self-Help Shows You How to Get Things Done</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge9cb5d9">
<p>
I spent years <i>very</i> into self-help stuff, mostly stuff by Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, Mark Manson, and so forth. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of helpful ways of dealing with stress, staying healthy, and being productive. Even so, you might say that I wouldn't even be writing this post if I had found the meaning I was looking for in this field. Most self-help seeks to appeal to a wide audience, and so takes few stands on deeper matters of meaning, instead either holding itself to smaller, more pragmatic things ("get in shape!" or "manage your finances!") or else grounds out in vague, woo-woo stuff of the "do what feels right to you!" kind.
</p>

<p>
The other big flaw in a lot of self-help is that it's mostly about solving problems. Don't get me wrong, solving problems is great, but it's not always the right way to come at things. Is grief that your mother died a "problem" to be solved? If every Sunday night you have a gnawing sense of dread, does that mean you should learn the best strategy for getting a promotion, or might it be a token of something deeper? All that being said, I think <i>The War of Art</i> by Steven Pressfield is very worthwhile, and Tim Ferriss's work is still top notch for learning how to get real world stuff done.

<div id="outline-container-org8c16200" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8c16200">Stoic Philosophy Tells You to Take the Reins of Your Feelings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c16200">
<p>
Unlike Existentialism, Stoic philosophy still pulls a lot of weight in my outlook. It is often pitched as fully in keeping with materialist belief, which it largely is, due to one of its main teachings: you can't control what happens in the world around you, but you can control how you think about it. Put enough work into steering how you <i>think</i> about what happens to you, and you can begin steering how you <i>feel</i> about things. Already, that's pretty worthwhile, and nothing about it goes against a materialist outlook.
</p>

<p>
The other main teaching of the stoics follows from this and is a bit harder to square with materialism, but you can if you wrangle it hard enough: since you can not control the world around you, no outside measures of "a good life" can withstand everything that might happen. Instead, you should steer your thoughts (and feelings) by "virtue". The reason this is harder for a materialist is that it turns out it's <i>really</i> hard, maybe even impossible, to come up with a truly bullet proof definition of "virtue" on purely empirical grounds. You can certainly get to good enough for living your life, but if you're looking for epistemic certainty, it can leave some gnawing doubts. The classical stoics didn't have this problem, because they believed virtue came from a universal divine source.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get started with Stoic philosophy, there are two good options: 1. <i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius and 2. <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> by Seneca. <i>Meditations</i> was the personal diary of a thoughtful and disciplined man, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> was the avuncular advice of a successful mentor helping a younger friend work out his life. You can't really go wrong with either, but <i>Meditations</i> comes off more like maxims and helpful self-talk, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> is more conversational and more understanding of the occasional misstep. Pick whichever of those grabs you more.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org128a270">
<p>
This is an online "<a href="https://meaningness.com">book</a>" that tries to tackle the problem of meaning, meaninglessness, and everything in between from a materialist-friendly Buddhist stand point. I think he does about as good a job as you possibly can if you take materialism as a key assumption. The heart of his argument is that most religious approaches put <i>too much</i> meaning on every damn thing, whereas nihilism puts <i>too little</i> meaning on stuff that everyone sees as meaningful unless you stop and think too hard about it. Instead, his take is that "meaning" is something rather ambiguous that all humans experience, partly by creating it and partly by responding to things in the outside world. Thorough, well-argued, and helpfully nuanced, maybe the best thing this book does is to make a telling, materialist-compatible case that nihilism is dumb and rationalism isn't an unassailable metaphysical/epistemological truth.

An adjacent couple of sets of writing I have found helpful is <a href="https://samzdat.com/">sam[]zdat</a> by Lou Keep and <a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/">Hotel Concierge</a>. These blogs begin with the same intellectual and cultural starting places as the wider "Rationalist" community, but wrestle much more with how far scientific evidence and logical reasoning can go when it comes to values and with the sometimes bad outcomes of reasonable courses of action with good intentions. Sadly, neither has posted in a long time.

<p>
Or, maybe you've come a bit farther than I've been thinking, and you're at least open to the thought that all of this "spiritual" stuff is not <i>only</i> metaphorical, not <i>just</i> a pithy way to sum up thorny psychological, sociological, and cultural factors, but instead there might be <i>something</i> outside of yourself that you'd be better off coming to know. Given who I reckon is reading this, it's fairly likely that when I say "religion," what comes to mind is something that looks a lot like Protestant Christianity - either in its Fundamentalist Evangelical flavor or its Progressive Social Justice flavor. Either that, or some kind of westernized Buddhism, as I have heard humorously, but not wrongly, called "Richard Gere Buddhism". Notwithstanding my less-than-kind likenesses, if any of that grabs you, by all means, go forth and delve into that thing!
</p>

<p>
For this post, though, I'm not going to say much on these, since I think you likely wouldn't be here if the ready-to-hand religious options did much for you. Instead, I'd like to draw your awareness to some <i>very</i> unalike choices. You see, religion of some kind is found amongst the folks of all lands, but between those lands, there are wildly unalike ways to deal with the spiritual world, many of which you might not have given much thought to. Here's a handful:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does Christianity hold some weight with you, but the kinds you know don't work for you? Consider poking around "Tradcath" (Traditional Catholic) or Orthodox Christianity. C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton are some worthwhile writers here, and there are loads of writings, podcasts, and so forth to check out online, but it's not a field I've looked deeply into, so I don't know which to steer you toward.</li>
<li>What if you can't get the claims of monotheism to make sense? The afore-said <i>World Full of Gods</i> does a wonderful job of spelling out why polytheism is worth taking earnestly, but if you'd like to give it a try yourself, check out <a href="https://kayeofswords.github.io/soulsinnerstatues/index.html">The Soul's Inner Statues</a> and pair with whatever mythology most speaks to you.</li>
<li>India and Japan have thriving home-grown religions in the shape of Hinduism and Shintoism/Buddhism (they often run together in Japan). Both have a very wide set of practices, prayers, rituals, and so forth, most of which are deeply linked with the neighborhoods from which they spring - so much so that you likely need to go and see them in the flesh to fully get them, but if something grabs you from afar, why not at least read about it?</li>
<li>Or how about the religious thinking and folkways of the sundry indigenous folks around the world? <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr. is a great starter for Native American Indian spirituality, and <i>Sand Talk</i> by Tyson Yunkaporta is one for Australian aboriginal people.</li>
<li>If you're <i>really</i> quirky, you might think about looking into some of the West's alternative spiritual paths of the last few hundred years - Theosophy, Occultism, the Druidry Revival, and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've shared all of the above since I think a lot of folks feel like their lives are lacking spiritually, but the [options] they know about leave them cold. If neither megachurch Christianity nor Yoga-studio Buddhism do it for you, it turns out there's a <i>lot</i> more out there, some of which just might grab you.

<h3 id="org3527e74">Heed Your Own Experience</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3527e74">
<p>
Whatever you find on your spiritual journey, remember that it is <i>your</i> journey. If religious or spiritual practices aren't working for you, then hey, they're not what you need right here and right now. On the other hand, if you find them worthwhile, don't let the fact that they seem weird or don't make sense to other people stop you from doing what works for you. It's hard enough to deal with your own doubts and those of your friends and kin if you find yourself drawn to Christianity or Buddhism or other widely-practiced religions, but it's even tougher if you find yourself drawn to something more out there. Praying to multiple Gods? Lighting incense? Putting on funny robes and walking around in circles? You might find yourself feeling a bit self-conscious, or worse. Whatever you do, the whole point of spiritual practice is to make better sense of yourself and your experience, and to enrich your life, so pay attention to how your practice makes you feel and what impact it has on your life, and don't let any hangups get in the way of that.

It might turn out to be a long, weird ride, but it's worth it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rules_of_germanish_meter">

<b>Date</b>: 2022-November-20
</p>

<p>
I'm writing this post as much as a reference for me and as a place to point to whenever I make use of traditional Germanish metrical forms as anything else. For all of this, I am greatly indebted to Eirik Westcoat who has written a great deal of poetry in modern English using these forms for Heathen religious purposes, and lays out the rules very clearly in his book <i>Viking Poetry for Heathen Rites</i>. Note that this post has nothing to say about the other great thread in Germanish poetic tradition, which is the use of formal, stylized metaphors known as <i>kennings</i>, like the "whale road" for the sea or "flame of battle" for a sword.

<h3 id="org6b4c345">Rules Common to All Germanish Meters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6b4c345">
<p>
Once you start learning the meters given below, it becomes clear that they are all variations on a theme. That "theme" was likely an ancestral form of poetry practiced by the speakers of Proto-Germanic that speakers of all of the Germanish languages took with them and changed over time. The most complex forms are all from Old Norse, which retained an unbroken native language poetic tradition until the latest time. I find it easier to remember a few key "lego pieces" that all of the meters are made of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alliteration and syllable counts are the main focus of Germanish meters - other poetic considerations like rhyming, placement of stress, and so forth are sometimes found, but distinctly secondary in importance</li>
<li>Only stressed syllables are counted for alliteration. In today's English, this is <i>usually</i> the first syllable, but not always, and it can be helpful to consult a dictionary, where stress is usually indicated with a "`" or similar symbol before the stressed syllable. Prefixes, like on-, be-, up-, un-, and so forth are often <i>not</i> stressed.</li>
<li>Note that the above allows a lot of flexibility in stress placement, compared to Latin and Greek poetic forms, but you do still get some interesting rhythm from following the rules given below</li>
<li>Consonant clusters that are pronounced as a single sound (th, ch, sk, sp, and so forth) alliterate with each other, rather than with the initial letter used in spelling. For example, "spelling" does not alliterate with "see", but does alliterate with "speak".</li>
<li>All vowels alliterate with each other (or "assonate" with each other if you want to be picky)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="org7a4d6cc">Rules for Fornyrdhislag - "Old Song Meter"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7a4d6cc">
<p>
This was one of the most common verse forms in Old Norse, and given its similarity to attested Anglo-Saxon and continental Germanish verse forms, it's likely pretty close to the Proto-Germanic kind of poetry from which all of these kinds sprang. Most of the other verse forms can be told of as changes to this one.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Usually written in eight-line stanzas</li>
<li>The main unit of composition is the short line/half line, which must have 2 stressed syllables and usually has 4+ total syllables</li>
<li>The alliteration is between pairs of these short lines (A and B), where the <b>first</b> stressed syllable of the second short line (B1) alliterates with <b>either or both</b> of the first or second stressed syllable of the first short line (A1 or A2)</li>
<li>The second stressed syllable of the second short line (B2) <b>must not</b> alliterate with the first stressed syllable in that short line (B1), but it <i>may</i> optionally alliterate with either of the stressed syllables in the first short line (A1 OR A2). Due to the above rule, this means that if B2 alliterates, it may only alliterate with whichever A syllable B1 <b>does not</b> alliterate with</li>

So far, this is the meter I have the most experience with, as it is fairly straightforward and bendsome, as well as coming from the same background as the Gods and Lore that I draw on the most. Almost the same as Fornyrdhislag, but with these changes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Usually, two "half lines" are written/printed together to form the single "long line" of the verse name. These follow the same alliteration rules as the pairs of short lines in fornyrdhislag</li>
<li>Half lines <i>must</i> have 4+ syllables each</li>
<li>Write as many lines as needed to tell what you're trying to say - they are not broken into stanzas</li>

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Comes in two half-stanzas of three lines, for a six-line stanza</li>
<li>The first two lines of each half stanza follow the same rules as the short lines from fornyrdhislag, though the first line can be as short as two or three syllables</li>

<h2 id="why_a_heathen_rosary" class="Post">Why a Heathen Rosary?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-25
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned last time, I thought I had put forth what I was up to coming up with a "Heathen Rosary", but it turns out I hadn't, so I thought "why not now?"
</p>

<p>
First off, it might be helpful to say what I mean by a "Heathen Rosary", since that could mean rather a few unalike things. In <i>Pagan Prayer Beads</i> by John Michael Greer and 'Clare Vaughn' (his wife's pen name for this work), they use "rosary" for any set of prayers tied to a set of prayer beads. Galina Krasskova <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/05/retooling-the-rosary/">"retooled" the rosary</a> with a set of prayers meant to be said on a set of beads made for the Christian Rosary and with the intent of keeping much of the rhythm of the Christian prayer, because she grew up around it and it was a foundational part of her early exposure to religious practice. My own take is somewhere in between these. I have never been Catholic, and the Rosary has never been a part of my spiritual practice. That being said, through prayer, meditation, and divination, I got the impression that I ought to come up with a prayer that takes advantage of much of what works well for the Christian Rosary, while still being customized for my own beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I got the idea I ought to work out a prayer that is "like the rosary", and to make that happen, I decided I ought to learn more about the Christian Rosary. As such, I've been reading through the prayers of Rosary and some works about it. From this reading, the thing that has struck me most strongly is the Rosary's alternation between familiarity/repetition and novelty. Also, the Christian Rosary has a strong alternation of praying to the masculine and feminine aspects of the Catholic religion. So, I've been trying to work out how to get the best of these traits in a regular prayer without calling upon Christian religious figures.
</p>

<p>
So, what I've come to is the <a href="#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Framework for a Heathen Rosary</a>. I'm still working out what the saying of intent and closing of each "group" of "Hail Iduns" should be, along with what the equivalent of the mysteries might be. My end goal is to have a set of prayers that share the Christian Rosary's balance between repetition and novelty, depth of theological ground covered, and alternation between masculine and feminine holy Beings, but that are said to the Gods and Goddesses I worship. On the contemplation side, I think that I will use Germanic myths, one myth in place of each "mystery", but I don't yet know how to group them. Divination has led me to make my beads with four sets of nine, and the main thread tying together the prayers, myth, and symbolism is the World Tree, Yggdrasil, but I'm still not entirely sure how to put all of that together. I'm also not sure how many groups of myths/mysteries to have, but I'm thinking maybe one for each of the Wyrds, or one for each day of the week, or one for each of the nine worlds, or something. I might have to start grouping myths together into groups of four and see how many meaningful categories I can infer.
</p>

<p>
Once I'm through all of this, I'd like to have a set of prayers I can say daily with associated contemplative material that will stand as a fairly compact, but also fairly complete, devotional practice. I'll share more here as I actually work it out!
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-September-18
</p>

<p>
I started writing this post thinking that I had already introduced my goal of coming up with a "Heathen Rosary," but looking back, it seems I only briefly mentioned it in my <a href="#the_hail_idun_prayer">"Hail Idun"</a> post. So here's the short version: the Rosary is a longstanding contemplative prayer that has been spiritually valuable to a lot of folks all around the world and for a very long time. As such, it seems like a good model for coming up with a contemplative prayer in keeping with my own beliefs. Through prayer, meditation, and just plain thinking about it, I've come to a rough idea of what that prayer might look like, but I've still got a lot of work to do.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to be further along in working this set of prayers out by this point, but since I'm not, I thought I'd share what I do have so far. I haven't written out any of the prayers other than the "Hail Idun" Prayer, but I've gotten some idea of the shape those prayers will take.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A Saying of Intent</li>
<li>Open each group of prayers with a prayer to Woden</li>
<li>Say Nine "Hail Iduns"</li>
<li>Close each group with a prayer that again affirms relatedness with the beings of the world</li>
<li>Repeat for four groups</li>
<li>Close with another saying of striving to live well</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you know the Christian Rosary, this pretty closely follows the framework there. That collection of prayers opens with the Apostle's Creed, has 5 groups of prayers (Decades), each of which begins with an "Our Father" and is made up of 10 repetitions of the "Hail Mary", and closes with a "Glory Be." At the end of the whole prayer is a closing prayer. The big difference in my group of prayers, other than praying to different spiritual beings, is that the opening and closing are less statements of <i>belief</i>, and more a statement of <i>intent</i>. For Christianity, stating what you believe to be true about the world is an important foundation of religious practice. Germanish religion, on the other hand, like most many-Godded beliefs, puts far more weight on what you <i>do</i> and how you relate to the Gods. As such, rather than a "creed", I plan to open with a statement of intention to live well and do right by the Gods, and for the closing prayer to reiterate this idea.
</p>

<p>
Having nine "Hail Iduns" was a pretty obvious choice, given the prominence of 9 as a holy number in Germanish belief, but it was harder to figure out how many groups of prayers to say. I've come down on four groups for now, mostly because it is pretty close to the 5 groups of the Christian Rosary, but there are more instances of "fours" in Germanish myth than "fives". I haven't yet worked out how many groups of themes for contemplation (the "Mysteries" in the Christian tradition) to use, but I'm leaning toward using myths as the themes, and possibly grouping into three groups, such as the "Wyrd Mysteries, Werthende Mysteries, and the Schuld Mysteries."
</p>

<p>
Another element that I think is quietly implicit in the Christian Rosary but that I intend to emphasize pretty heavily is the alternation between prayers to a masculine power and to a feminine power. In Christianity, that's Jesus and Mary, and for me, that will mainly be Woden and Idun. I think that this interplay of masculine and feminine is essential to how this particular set of prayers works, but it might also be influenced by Christianity being otherwise so heavily oriented toward the masculine. The other complicating factor is that the Christian theological world is comparatively simple compared to most polytheistic understandings of the world - you cover pretty much all of your theological bases by affirming the Trinity and then praying to God the Father in the way Jesus taught, and by affirming Jesus's role even in the prayers to Mary.
</p>

<p>
For a polytheist, getting the same sense of praying to "everything overall" is much harder (and perhaps not needed?). In my case, I am seeing the unifying factor as the Tree of Life, Yggdrassil, and the relationships between the Gods, spirits, and other beings that it represents as what to call upon for "the whole holy world". I might also bring the Wyrds (Norns) into either the replacement for the "Glory Be" and/or the closing prayer. While specific divine beings, they are also embodiments of the workings of the universe and are connected with the Tree.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm planning on writing prayers for each of these pieces following a traditional Germanish meter (likely "Anglo-Saxon Long Lines"), and I'll share them here as I get them written. As always, any thoughts or feedback are welcome.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-looking_into_the_our_father">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-21
</p>

<p>
After my <a href="#lessons_learned_on_prayer_from_the_council_of_trent">earlier post</a> on the Catechism of the Council of Trent about the section "On Prayer", I went ahead and read through the rest of the section, which is a line-by-line treatment of the "Our Father". The catechism uses this prayer as an example of a single, sufficient prayer for Christian practice. While I am not a Christian, I find the thought of having one prayer that is a wholly sufficient baseline an especially interesting one, and I thought that it would be helpful to look in detail at what the Council of Trent had to say about the "Our Father". 
</p>

<p>
Since I'm not a Christian, my main interest is in thinking through what crafting such a prayer for another faith might mean. Of course, I'm especially interested in coming up with such a prayer for my own faith, but to try to make this helpful for others, I'd like to generalize as much as possible.  Lastly, though much of the prayer is particularly Christian, there is much within the prayer that is inspiring and beautiful for any spiritual path, and might be worth thinking through how to emulate in other faiths, and I'd like to highlight that as well.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6922a99" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6922a99">The Progression of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6922a99">
<p>
The Council of Trent broke down the prayer line-by-line and talked about what each line meant on its own, but also as a logical progression. The heart of it seems to be that you start universal, end universal, and have more particular asks sandwiched in-between. Each thing asked for also works both as a "plain" request for something obvious, and as a more sophisticated spiritual statement.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org72bc473" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org72bc473">Our Father, Who Art in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org72bc473">
<p>
The prayer begins by calling upon a loving father, not a harsh or distant lord. By specifying "our" father, the prayer also acknowledges that all men are brothers, and God is the father of all. Since Christians believe God to be everywhere, "Who art in Heaven" at first doesn't make much sense, but it serves to draw attention to the noblest part of visible nature, the sky, and asks those praying to compare that with God. More personally, by placing the highly personal figure of a "father" in the highly spiritual locale of "heaven", the prayer immediately establishes a link between personal practice and the transcendental goods sought through spiritual practice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org68a44e3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org68a44e3">Hallowed Be Thy Name</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org68a44e3">
<p>
The Council of Trent recognizes that God's name can be nothing but hallowed in an abstract sense, but instead frames this bit of the prayer as a recognition, and a plea by the one praying to treat the name of God as holy. More subtly, the Council argues that all things that are good and hallowed are encompassed by God's name, and that this part of the prayer recognizes that. It also serves as a reminder to those praying to try to bring holiness to God's name through their actions outside of prayer, which will serve as an encouragement to any folks whose belief might be wavering.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8b400f9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8b400f9">Thy Kingdom Come</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8b400f9">
<p>
The Council of Trent puts this forward as the highest possible good and says that it holds all other goods that might possibly be asked for - anything that might be truly good is actually a part of the Kingdom of God, and anything not a part of the Kingdom of God only seems good, but isn't truly so. This part of the prayer is meant to remind believers to notice how much better the goods of the Kingdom of Heaven are than the goods of this world, but also as an encouragement to bring as much of the Kingdom of God into the world as possible.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org03a29ab">
<p>
This is one that is seemingly at first the most strongly associated with purely Christian theology, yet that maybe has useful lessons for other faiths as well. The core idea is that the one praying ought to acknowledge that what he thinks he wants might actually not be such a great idea, and instead that he should gladly accept what the God prayed to believes to be best. Christians justify this position with original sin - because you are fundamentally flawed and cut off from the Divine, whatever you will to happen is tainted, and so you should instead seek the will of the higher power, who is untainted. Even without original sin, though, you can pretty readily get to the idea that what we think is best might not have all the needed information. The world is a big, complicated place, and we are just some moderately clever social apes - why on earth would we think that we know what's best for us? If you believe in the idea of a God or Gods at all, you should trust that they know a bit better than we do, from our highly limited material points of view.

<h4 id="orge9e91e6">On Earth as It Is in Heaven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge9e91e6">
<p>
This bit was especially interesting to me, as I learned something I hadn't ever considered before: the Council of Trent says that "On Earth as It Is in Heaven" applies equally to "Hallowed be Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," and "Thy will be done." I had always only read it as an extension of "Thy will be done" and nothing else. On the one hand, this clause acknowledges the contrast between that which is spiritual and that which is worldly, but on the other, it also works as a thanksgiving, to the degree that God's name is hallowed, His kingdom has come, and His will is done in this world. More broadly, it acknowledges the perfection of Heaven and the lack of perfection in the material world and expresses longing for the material world becoming more like the perfect spiritual world.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge16a644" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge16a644">Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge16a644">
<p>
Here we at last come to the asking for day-to-day, bodily things. One of the points the Council of Trent makes is exactly that the asking for bodily things comes only after asking for the highest and most spiritual things. I also appreciate the amount of meaning they find in the few words in this line. Asking for "our" daily bread acknowledges that you have to work, but you also rely on God's help for anything good that comes into your life. Asking for "daily" bread acknowledges that you're asking for what you need everyday - necessities, not luxuries. "This day" acknowledges that what you had yesterday might not come automatically today - you can't take these things for granted and should keep on being thankful so long as you have what you need. Lastly, "Give us" rather than "give me" encourages the one praying to think not only of himself, but of the needs of all of his fellow men.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not Christian, this is an impressive amount of religious meaning to pack into one line! I think it's maybe significant that we're really getting to the richest lines of the prayer when we turn from asking for high-level spiritual goods to normal, earthly needs.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf413933" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf413933">Forgive Us Our Trespasses as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf413933">
<p>
This might be considered the heart of the Christian belief system, and might be the part of the prayer least easily adapted to other beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I think that forgiveness is an important part of many religious beliefs, but in Christianity, it is <i>the</i> belief, and so the line in the most common Christian prayer that most directly deals with forgiveness deserves a bit of attention. Once again, the plural subject ("forgive <b>us our</b> trespasses as <b>we</b> forgive those who trespass against <b>us</b>") does a lot of heavy lifting - this is not only asking for help with one's own forgiveness, but for all of mankind to get better at this very hard skill. Like other parts of the prayer, this one acknowledges the work done by both the one praying and God, in partnership. Lastly, one thought I found especially helpful from the Catechism was that folks might avoid saying the whole prayer, or at least this bit, if they had folks they couldn't yet forgive. In other words, if someone had someone against whom they were still nursing a grudge, they might hold off saying the "Our Father", or at least the line about forgiving trespasses. The Council of Trent very strongly came down on the belief that this was a mistake. More broadly, I think the idea that we ought to pray for the things we <i>wish</i> were true about us, even if we currently fall short, is a useful one.

<div id="outline-container-org0f74f77" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0f74f77">And Lead Us Not Into Temptation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0f74f77">
<p>
This is another bit where the Council of Trent makes some rather Christian assumptions - that "temptation" is something the Devil does and that is an unquestionable feature of existence. That being said, I think anyone who has been alive past childhood has experienced the draw of thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors that some part of them more readily dismisses. What I thought was most helpful in the Council of Trent's analysis was the notion that temptation is an intrinsic part of being alive, and so no amount of prayer will get you to a life "without temptation" - instead, the goal is no more temptation than you can handle with God's help. This seems both a. much  more do-able, and b. more consistent with other theological interpretations. For example, Christian theology might have it that making love to a bunch of strangers is lustful and therefore bad. On the other hand, if you belong to a belief that has looser beliefs about sex, you might still believe that having sex with strangers might be bad if a. you've pledged yourself to someone else, or b. it gets in the way of forming a more serious relationship with one person. In this case, the "temptation" to have sex with multiple new folks might still be very strong, but the Christian and non-Christian beliefs about why it should be avoided would be different, even if they came up with the same recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I appreciate the reminder that this part of the prayer is useful both for dealing with "avoiding temptation" in the abstract, or in general, and also in the moment to resist specific temptations. Whatever negative stuff you want to avoid, you should likely pray for daily, as well as whenever you find yourself needing help in the moment.

<h4 id="orgc6af2ee">But Deliver Us From Evil</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc6af2ee">
<p>
Much as "Thy Kingdom Come" holds all of the good you might ask for in any prayer, so "deliver us from evil" holds the wish to have everything not good taken away. In some sense, everything asked for above is held within this - as all of the good things asked for are, in fact, the lack of evil. One nice thing about this bit of the prayer is that folks tend to pray to get rid of what's wrong anyway, even if not especially religious ("no atheists in foxholes" and so forth). All that being said, this bit of the prayer is at the end, because asking for spiritual goods is more important overall. Also, some seeming "evils" might actually be good for our souls. Lastly, this says "from <b>Evil</b>", rather than "from <b>evils</b>", as Christianity sees all evil as coming from one source (the devil), and acknowledges that some material circumstances might seem evil, while actually being good for you - this way of praying allows for experiencing things that seem crappy in the moment, but might be for the best in the long run.

<div id="outline-container-org0fc5497" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0fc5497">Amen</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0fc5497">
<p>
The prayer ends with a word rich with weight from scripture. Most importantly, "amen" works as a "seal" to mark the prayer as done, but with a feeling of gladness. In Catholic ceremonies, the congregation does not say "amen", but instead the priest says "amen" back to them, which they treat as a sign that the prayer has been heard and will be acted upon. According to the Council, even when praying alone, "amen" can work as a glad celebration of coming closer to God, a reminder of what the prayer just finished was truly for.

<div id="outline-container-orge04fd65" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge04fd65">The Theology of the Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge04fd65">
<p>
Now, one thing I kept running into while reading the Council's analysis was that their arguments were cogent, coherent, and self-consistent - <i>if you accept Christian theology</i>. If your beliefs differ, it's a bit less helpful. Even so, I think that identifying the main strands of theological belief will be helpful in coming up with what others might get out of an analysis of the "Our Father".
</p>

<p>
First off, the prayer is assumed to be directed to the single source of all goodness, God. If you are coming from a non-monotheistic standpoint, you might see the value in having a single source of all goodness, but you might not attribute it to a single "God". Regardless of what this source of all goodness is, the prayer opens by addressing it joyfully, follows up by wishing for it to be realized in the world as much as possible, and then acknowledges that all day-to-day material goods also come from this source of all goodness, and closes by acknowledging that we all fall short of what we would like, and asking for help in doing the right thing.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, since this is, in fact, a Christian prayer, we have to deal with concept of original sin. Original sin is implicit in much of the prayer, and explored in more depth by the Council's analysis. The entire prayer basically assumes that the one praying is in a fallen state and needs redemption, and that this prayer is one of the chief tools in seeking and achieving that end. Obviously this comes out most clearly in the lines about forgiving trespasses, leading not into temptation, and delivering from evil. As I'll get into below, this strikes me as likely one of the biggest theological differences another faith would have to work around if looking for inspiration from this prayer. Related to this is the single source of all Evil mentioned above, which has a certain tidiness to it, but again, doesn't jive with everyone's view of the world.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, much of the prayer expects those praying to do their share of the work, which I find quite interesting, and likely useful to apply outside of a Christian context. Though God is acknowledged as all powerful and the author of all good things, at least according to the Council of Trent, the one praying still has to do work and pray and believe and otherwise live consistently with what's being asked for, rather than just sitting back and waiting for God to handle everything. That might be the element of the Council's analysis that I found most interesting - it consistently stressed the active, engaged role folks need to take to get the most of prayer specifically and their spiritual life more broadly.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78f6898" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78f6898">What Can We Learn for Other Faiths?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78f6898">
<p>
Despite the challenges of generalizing from a strongly Christian starting point, I think that there are some helpful lessons for crafting prayers for other faiths. Structurally speaking, I rather like the progression of the "Our Father" - as mentioned above, it begins by naming to Whom the prayer is addressed, asks for/affirms faith in the highest good things that Being can give, goes into more earthly requests, and closes with another universal, but this time "flipped" (deliver us from Evil rather than grant us the Kingdom of Heaven). So, I think that following the structure for prayers in other faiths would not present too much of a challenge, and could even be followed pretty closely, if wanted, by substituting in things appropriate to the Being prayed to. My <a href="#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of Fallhall's Prayer</a> is pretty close to that.
</p>

<p>
What gives a bit more of a challenge is looking at the prayer's theology and thinking through how to craft a prayer that fulfills a <i>functional</i> role similar to what the "Our Father" does for Christianity, even if it's actual structure is different - ideally, one that also functions as a "single, sufficient prayer" for a different system of belief. Drawing on the theological threads we stepped through above, the three core things we identified the prayer doing functionally are 1. acknowledging/celebrating the source of all Goodness, 2. seeking redemption as a sinful being in a fallen world, and 3. calling upon the one praying to show his faith and belief by living a life consistent with what is asked for in the prayer. 
</p>

<p>
These are highly specific to the Christian faith, and if we want to write a prayer for another faith, we'll have to express some different things. So, I've taken the three threads above and generalized them further: 1. is either the highest good, its source, or both, 2. is whatever this faith most seeks, what "problem it solves", and 3. is an affirmation to live consistent with your beliefs. For example, for Druidry, 1. might be the concept Awen, 2. might be knowledge, power, and peace, and 3. might be asking to live in harmony with nature. This might be harder for religions that don't have something as clear cut that they seek as Christianity is about seeking forgiveness for sins, or a more multi-faceted concept about what the highest good is or where it comes from.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, I haven't worked out a prayer for my own beliefs following these recommendations yet, but I am glad I went through this exercise, I think it's been a helpful step, and I look forward to coming up with something.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_hail_idun_prayer">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-14
</p>

<p>
Keeping on with taking Christian prayers and writing a Heathen prayer as close to their shapes as I can, I've taken the "Hail Mary" and written the "Hail Idun". Idun is very important to me and my spiritual practice, and I think it likely that once I get to my goal of a full "Heathen Rosary", some kind of "Hail Idun" (whether this, or in Germanic metre or something else) will likely be the heart of the practice.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org75b12fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org75b12fd">Hail Idun</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75b12fd">

Hail Idun<br />

Brego* is with Thee.<br />

<p>
<i>*Brego is possibly an Old English form of Bragi, God of Poetry and Idun's husband, who may or may not be a hypostasis of Odin/Woden. I picked it because it sounded better than "Bragi" to me.
**Wen is one take on the plural of *Wan, the hypothetical Old English form of the Old Norse Vanr, Vanir. Others suggest "Wanes", though there's no direct textual evidence for the word either way in Old English, and some folks question whether the Anglo-Saxons believed in the same two tribes of Gods as the Old Norse did.</i>

<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-August-05

<p>
After asking for some resources on prayer on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/190418.html?thread=32258258#cmt32258258">past Magic Monday</a>, samchevre pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_catechism_of_the_Council_of_Trent/Part_4">The Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>. Sure enough, despite its explicit Catholic Christian focus, I found a lot of good thinking on prayer as a practice, and I'd like to share what I thought were the most helpful takeaways for folks of any faith.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc38af56" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc38af56">1. Kinds of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc38af56">
<p>
<b>Asking for Things</b>: Maybe the most common kind of prayer, the Council of Trent held that it was right and proper to ask God in prayer for anything it was right for folks to have. While it is certainly possible to ask for the wrong kind of things in prayer, and it takes some practice to ask for the right kind of things (more on both below), the evidence we have from just about every spiritual tradition that has recorded prayers shows folks asking the Gods for things that they want. If done right, this is not just a "gimme, gimme!" or a business transaction, but instead a way of acknowledging that you can't do <i>anything</i> in the world without your wider context and the help of the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thanksgiving</b>: Even if you are uncomfortable with asking for things in prayer, I think it's hard, if not impossible, to find anything wrong with prayers of thanksgiving. Even materialists <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-happiness-research/">acknowledge how worthwhile being consciously thankful is</a>. Even more so than asking for things in prayer, giving thanks for what you have in this life is a good way to acknowledge that you are dependent on wider and higher things.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf430ee4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf430ee4">2. Outcomes of Prayer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf430ee4">
<p>
<b>Bringing You Closer to the Holy</b>: I think the biggest thing prayer does for you is to bring you closer to the Holy and open you up to its influence. However you pray, it's a way to take some time to think about and reach out to whatever you think of as Holy, and hopefully to listen for some kind of answer. Many spiritual practices can do this, but prayer has the strengths of being ready to do whenever and wherever you are, and being changeable to whatever your needs are right now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acknowledging Something Greater than Yourself</b>: I talked about this in both kinds of prayer above, but most any kind of prayer leads you to acknowledge that you need the wider world and its God(s). Even for things you did "by yourself", you still have your parents, teachers, employers, and culture to thank, to say nothing of any Gods or Goddesses. While humility can go too far into abasing yourself or groveling, most of us can use a timely reminder that we are not an island and that the world has given us a great many gifts that we ought to be thankful for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Giving a Gift</b>: Prayer can also be a gift to the Gods, the same as incense or a candle or mead. The more care and thought you put into the prayer, and the better it is said, the better it works as such. This is the most helpful when you lack the means to give something else, but is still worthwhile even if you have all of the offerings you might wish for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Helping the Dead</b>: Most faiths believe that the dead can use some help in the afterlife, and that prayer is one way of offering that help. For Christians, you pray for souls in Purgatory, other faiths might pray for souls to learn the lessons of their past life as smoothly as they might so they can move on to another life, and so forth. Whatever you believe about the afterlife (well, I guess, unless you don't believe in one), it seems that prayer is helpful to those in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1cf2fd6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1cf2fd6">3. How to Pray</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cf2fd6">
<p>
<b>Prayer Works Best as a Habit</b>: The Catechism talks about prayer as a "duty", not something nice-to-have or optional. I don't know if that way of thinking is true for all faiths, but I think it is very much true that prayer works best as a habit, something you do at least every day. Much of the good of prayer only seems to come when you have done it for awhile with unalike things going on in your life. From what I have seen, it seems best to find many little ways to bring prayer into your life - something to say when you wake up, when you go to sleep, before you eat, when you put on a worn holy symbol, and so forth, as well as a "main" prayer set aside as its own thing. Of course, all of this doesn't have to be piled on at once, as that's not how good habit-building works, but over time, adding such things helps to make prayer a given, rather than something that takes will and forethought.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pray in the Right Frame of Mind with the Right Feeling</b>: For Christians, the Council of Trent recommends that Christians go into prayer with 1. utmost humility, 2. sorrow or regret for sins done, 3. a lack of unworthy feelings like wrath or pride, and 4. faith in God. Once praying, the prayer should be heartfelt, with the ideal being that you "pour out" what is in your heart and soul with great warmth. I feel like the strong weight put on humility and sinfulness may not fit with every other faith, but the heart of the thought, that you should put yourself in a frame of mind in keeping with what is best to your Gods and then pray earnestly and with true feeling, seems like a good one to me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ask for the Right Things</b>: The Catechism gave what struck me as a remarkably good rede about asking for things in prayer. First, get in the habit of asking God(s) for all things that you want in your life. Second, practice only asking for things that bring you closer to God(s). This is a really good way to build habits - you start by harnessing your natural yearning to have stuff to get you to pray often. Hopefully, as you do this, you start thinking about and acknowledging the role of the Holy in bringing good things into your life. Having gotten used to thinking about God(s) shaping what comes into your life, you can more readily think about what kinds of things God(s) might most want you to do in the world, and you can start asking for that. Through this change, you learn to ask for the right things, which makes even your prayers asking for stuff into a way to come closer to the Holy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Prayer Becoming a Way to Do Unworthy Things</b>: For all the good that prayer can and does do, it can also become hollow, or even worse, truly harmful. If you only say the words or go through the motions, not only won't you get much out of prayer, you might sour on it or even on the Holy. There's some place for "fake it till you make it" in any kind of habit building, but if prayer feels hollow for a long time, it's likely not doing you any good, and you might need to work out a new way of doing things. Still worse is if you let prayer become a tool for your pride - showing off, making a big fuss about how strong your belief is, or the like. The Council refers to Jesus's well-known rede to pray indoors, out of the public eye. I think there's a role for public prayer, but a good rule of thumb seems to be that if you <i>only</i> pray when others are watching, you're likely doing it wrong.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Lone Sufficient Prayer Can Be Helpful to Have</b>: The Catechism puts forth the "Our Father" as a wholly sufficient prayer by itself. In other words, as a Christian, if you only pray the Our Father, you're doing everything you need to do with prayer. Other prayers are helpful and do a lot of good, of course, but they say that you only really <i>need</i> this one prayer. I found this a highly interesting thought. I think it would be very helpful to look at your faith and ask yourself "if I could only say one prayer for the rest of this life, and I wanted to get at everything that is most important in my faith, what would that prayer be?" I think that most faiths likely don't have a ready-to-go answer the way Christianity does (perhaps the "Bond Among Druids" for Revival Druidry), but that writing it would be a worthy goal to strive for.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some Hands-On Tips</b>: The Council also gave a handful of more hands-on tips that I thought were helpful: 1. "Mental Prayer" (praying without speaking out loud) not only works, but is often best suited to sharing strong, deep feelings. That being said, praying out loud helps you stay focused and can be a spur to feelings of devotion. 2. Food and drink can make it harder to have the right mindset or feeling for prayer, so it might be best to pray without having eaten or had drinks besides water for some time. Fasting can also bring on an even stronger feeling for prayer. 3. Try to make your deeds outside of prayer line up with what you ask for in prayer. If you ask for help, but give no help to others, you shouldn't think that will work out well for you.

<p>
This started out as at least half a joke, but as I worked through it, I was like "huh, maybe this isn't all bad". The Lord's Prayer is one of the few pieces of my lukewarm Christian upbringing that really stuck in my mind, and I've always appreciated its cadence, so I tried to keep that as much as possible here while making the concepts fitting for a prayer to Woden. That being said, I'm <i>really</i> new at this prayer/poetry thing, so I'm sure I'll look back at this in a bit and cringe.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Allfather, who art in Fallhall,<br />
Awesome be Thy name.<br />
Thy walkyries come, Thy will be done,<br />
On fields choosing the winners.<br />
Teach us this day our daily lore,<br />
And welcome us as wayfarers,<br />
As we welcome those who wayfare amongst us.<br />
Lead us not into shamefulness,<br />
And unshackle us from fetters.<br />
For Thine is the wisdom,<br />
and the greatness, and the lordship,<br />
As long as this age shall last.<br />

Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.

It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.
</p>

<p>
So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-destinations_and_journeys">

<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-22
</p>

<p>
The other day, I read <a href="https://open-space.dreamwidth.org/8001.html">this post</a> the other day by an online acquaintance, which reinforced the old-but-good maxim that it is not the destination that matters, but rather the journey. I agree with this, but in responding to the post, I had a few thoughts on it that I thought I'd get down and post here.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2cd3914" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2cd3914">The Destination is not the <i>Goal</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2cd3914">
<p>
So, you've likely heard some variation of this fortune-cookie-style wisdom before, that the journey is what matters, not where you're going. As I said above, I think this is mostly true and worth keeping in mind, since our psychology and society often push us into laser-focusing on the destination with remarkable tunnel vision. It's helpful to be reminded that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo">"life moves pretty fast - if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."</a> Also, every single successful person you ever talk to will tell you that the experience of achieving what they were after was nowhere near as engaging and interesting as the pursuit. Also, paradoxically, if you start out overly focused on outcomes and end points, you might just miss out on developing what you need to develop to even reach them at all. Often, focusing on the process instead of the goal is <i>how</i> you get to the goal at all. But notice in all of these examples, we're still talking about goals and destinations, they're still assumed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org862b6aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org862b6aa">Destinations are <i>Excuses</i> for Journeys</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org862b6aa">
<p>
Okay, so journeys = good and destinations = bad, right? We should just stop setting goals or having specific places to go, right? Well, maybe not so much. There's a difference between a journey and wandering - the destination. So, we have a bit of a paradox. We want to value destinations less than journeys, but we need destinations to have journeys. What I realized in responding to my friend's post is that destinations are <i>excuses</i> for journeys - necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for what we're looking for. I keep having this insight over and over again playing with my daughter - I'll get frustrated that she's being slow to take her turn on Candy Land, or that she gets distracted by a stick while kicking her soccer ball into a goal. On my better days, though, I'll catch myself and realize "oh, right, achieving the 'goal' of this activity isn't actually why we're doing this, it's so that she can have fun and spend time with me and learn things". Another helpful example for me is playing games. Within the game itself, sure, you're playing to win, but you're <i>really</i> playing the game to have fun with your friends, so you likely shouldn't act like a dick to try to win. So how do we recognize that we need destinations so that we'll take journeys, while not attaching too much importance to them?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga49e706" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga49e706">How Do you Balance these?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga49e706">
<p>
I like to think about it as something similar to the advice to have "strong opinions, loosely held" that you'll run into in the startup world. It's helpful to have specific goals or destinations, maybe even ambitious ones, but not to focus on them so hard that you lose sight of what's around you on the way. One thing I think helps do this is to be suspicious of "efficiency", when that means "get to the outcome as fast as possible". Sure, sometimes efficiency is worthwhile, but only when it is compatible with whatever other goals or values the journey might be meant to support. If you purposely chose to take the scenic route for the sights and stops, it's foolish to speed once you get on it. If you asked your kid to help clean up so she learns to be helpful and responsible, then it's dumb to do things for her because she's slow about it. If you started a company to have freedom and autonomy, it's foolish to take a deal that puts you in someone else's pocket. So, to properly value the journey, we have to think about not where we're going, but why we chose that end point in the first place, and be ready to adjust along the way.

<h2 id="reading_goal_for_2022" class="Post">Reading Goal for 2022</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reading_goal_for_2022">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2022-January-05
</p>

<p>
This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:
</p>

<p>
<i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i>
</p>

<p>
I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?
</p>

<p>
A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="https://fs.blog/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/#2-the-lindy-effect">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.
</p>

<p>
So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

<b>Date</b>: 2021-December-28
</p>

<p>
For now, I'm lucky enough to get to share my thoughts with students every semester. That being said, there's a lot of stuff that I think is really helpful that I can't justify sharing in my course, as it's not so much about "business" or "communication". So, I reckoned I'd gather up that kind of thing here. Mostly, it's stuff I wish I had known when I was younger, so it ought to be very helpful to young folks. On the other hand, I wasn't all that young when I learned a lot of this, so you might still find something helpful here even if you're not so young.
</p>

<p>
Given that this is the internet, and that I teach at a university, I feel like I have to say clearly that these are my own views, and not those of my employer. I've posted them here to help maintain some of that distance. If you see anything here that upsets you, I'd like to hear from you so we can talk it over, especially if you're one of my students.

<h4 id="org6df6d3d">Learn and Use Mental Models</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6df6d3d">
<p>
My good friend Jonathan introduced me to "mental models", which are perhaps best explained by the blog <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a>, but here's the short version: different fields have their own ways of thinking about the world, and many of these ways can be applied outside of their home field. Naming these ways of thinking as more-or-less contained "models" makes it easier to remember and apply them in a variety of situations. The other reason it's helpful to think of them as separate "models" is that it reminds you that they are just that: useful abstractions that help you understand the world, not the raw, objective truth.

<h4 id="org7734135">Learn How to Read a Book</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7734135">
<p>
Anyone who wants to read books for more than fun needs to read <i>How to Read a Book</i> by Adler and Van Doren. If you haven't read it, your education has a serious gap. They break down reading into four levels: 1. Elementary, 2. Inspectional, 3. Analytical, 4. Syntopic. 1. <i>Elementary reading</i> is what you learned in grade school: marks on a page form meaningful words - that's all most folks know how to do. 2. <i>Inspectional reading</i> could be called "intelligent skimming" - you shoot to get the most out of a book in a fixed amount of time. 3. <i>Analytical reading</i> is where things get interesting. This is when you want to get the most out of a book, <i>period</i>. You take all the time you need to grok it in fullness. 4. <i>Syntopic reading</i> is when you want to understand a concept or field of study and so you read a lot of works by different authors and make sense of them all together. Even if you don't follow the exact scheme of this book or the techniques it outlines, I think it is very useful to have an idea of different levels of reading depending on what you're trying to do, and to apply them intentionally.

<div id="outline-container-org24f31f5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org24f31f5">Use Divergence and Convergence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org24f31f5">
<p>
I was introduced to this pair of concepts by my former boss Tony, who learned them by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Basadur">Dr. Min Basadur</a> and becoming certified in his creative problem solving approach (which is currently called <a href="https://www.basadur.com/simplexity/">"Simplexity"</a>). In creative thinking, you have two processes which are both necessary, but are better done separately: "diverging" and "converging". <i>Diverging</i> is where you try to generate as many options as possible. <i>Convergence</i> is when you evaluate the options generated and try to pick the best ones based on whatever criteria is relevant. These two ways of thinking use very different mental processes, and they interfere with each other. This approach applies in a surprisingly broad number of fields: in writing, you want to write a crappy first draft and edit, if you're figuring out where to go to dinner with your friends, throw out any options you can think of without worrying about if any of them are 'good', and only <i>then</i> pick something from that list. So, any time you're trying to solve a problem, first come up with as many options as you can, pause, and then look at those options and ask which ones work. Repeat as needed.

<h4 id="org4374b81">Seek Out Old, Weird Things</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4374b81">
<p>
Don't waste your time trying to fit in. Not because fitting in isn't important - it is. But that shit will take care of itself. Even the weirdest, most against-the-grain bastard you can think of is still a product of his time and culture. So, unless you are already a hermit living deep in the woods, cultivate an interest in the obscure, the far off, and the long ago. Even though there are certain charms to eccentricity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYpsdBJlBcU">in and of itself</a>, that's not what I'm pushing here. In a big, highly-linked world, your best hope for being valuable is to bring a combination of talents and knowledge to the table that <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/navals-writing">no one else has</a>, not by doing what everyone around you is doing. The two best heuristics I know of for making this happen are to go after what is weird and what is old. When you start poking around weird/old things, you're going to run into a lot of mularkey, but this is actually a feature, not a bug - you get to practice evaluating sources and how they fit in with what else you know. If everything you encounter fits into a neat, coherent system without this work, you are missing or distorting large chunks of reality, because reality is messy. What do I mean by "weird"? Anything that would get a snooty look at a cocktail party is a good start - cryptids, UFOs, alternate versions of history, magic, conspiracies, and so forth. Am I saying you should <i>believe</i> all of this stuff? Of course not. The idea is to expose yourself to ways of thinking that are very different from what you'll usually encounter - sometimes, when used carefully, some of those ways of thinking are useful. And that leaves "old", this one is simpler - if it was written before you were born, chances are pretty good that it contains some ways of looking at the world that seem pretty alien to you, which again, is the point of the exercise.

<h4 id="org9017f75">Learn and Recognize the Three Economies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9017f75">
<p>
I encountered this model in John Michael Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition/9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</a>, which itself draws heavily on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E.F. Schumacher</a>. The book was helpful for a variety of reasons, but the best bit was a mental model (see above). Greer breaks down "the economy" into three separate economies that work very differently: the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Economies. I'll start in the middle with the most familiar: the <i>Secondary Economy</i> is the economy of goods and services. I cut up meat to sell to the baker and use the proceeds to buy the products of the candlestick maker. Economics as a field is very good at analyzing the Secondary Economy, but tends not to think much about the <i>Primary Economy</i>, which is everything the natural world does to allow human economic activity to happen at all. When a farmer buys seed and a tractor and works his tuchus off cultivating and harvesting his crops, that's all Secondary Economy work. The fact that plants evolved little starch pods called grain, that the microbes in the soil allow plants to grow in it, that bees pollinate the plants, and that the sun shines down free energy for photosynthesis is all the Primary Economy. Lastly, we have the <i>Tertiary Economy</i>, which is the economy of financial instruments like money, loans, and stocks. Theoretically, everything in the Tertiary Economy is a representation of something in the Primary or Secondary Economy: I have a piece of paper called a "Title" that says I own a chunk of land, but the bank has a piece of paper saying they get the land if I don't pay back the loan they gave me to buy the title, and so on. So long as the Tertiary Economy remains pretty lightly linked with the Primary and Secondary economies, it's incredibly useful - using money to settle transactions and measure wealth has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">lots of benefits</a>, and other financial instruments help to start bigger, more complex businesses that can be valuable to everybody. Unfortunately, the Tertiary Economy has a tendency to become unmoored from underlying economic reality and to eat up more and more of the total share of economic activity in the form of speculative bubbles. The more emphasis on the Tertiary Economy, the more bubbles like this happen. Our current economy is something like 75% in the Tertiary by notional dollar value, which is definitely something to think about.

<h4 id="org8c690b1">Work Out Your Relationship to Meaning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c690b1">
<p>
This is the bit of this post I had the hardest time writing. It's big, weighty, and feelings run very strong around it. So I'll just try to dive in. At one time or another, all of us grapple with questions like "what's the point of all this?" or "how do I know what to really care about?" Some of us find answers that work for us in the teachings of a religion or a philosophy. Others of us look to what science and reason can tell us. And some of us try to bring our eyes down to the here and now and focus on what's right in front of us and set aside such big, maybe unanswerable questions. Perhaps the most common response is to distract ourselves from the questions so that we don't have to think about them. Television, booze, sex, jobs, gadgets, jewelry - whatever our own vice might be, we find something that lets us ignore those questions for a while. This is a bad long-term strategy, for at some point, <i>something</i> will happen that will show you the distractions for what they are - empty, meaningless, a waste of your precious time and attention. Sometimes this can hit like a ton of bricks: maybe someone you love dies, or maybe the relationship you've built your life around ends, or you find out you've only got a few months to live. If you wait for these heavy moments to think seriously about meaning, you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">gonna have a bad time</a>. Instead, start now. I won't tell you what traditions to explore, and I certainly won't tell you what conclusions to come to. This kind of thing is irreducibly personal, and what works for me is unlikely to work for you. If you're at a loss on where to start, there's an online book called <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> that I think does a pretty good job of outlining many of the reasons this is a thorny problem, approaches that have historically been tried and some of the problems with them, and so forth. You could also do worse than to read some ancient philosophy. If there's a religious tradition that's familiar or appeals to you, you might see what it has to offer. Wherever you start, don't expect this to be a quick project, something you sort out over the summer and never think about again. Wrestling with meaning is a life-long challenge, but one that can make everything else far more worthwhile.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-meditate_discursively">
<p>
Lots of folks these days take seriously the idea of taking a bit of time every day to get your mind right, which is great. On the other hand, almost all of them practice forms of "mind-emptying" techniques that seek to still conscious thought, which is a bit less great. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with such techniques in and of themselves, but they have some little talked-about downsides. First off, very many folks find them tough to get started with or keep up. Secondly, even for folks who make a habit of it, many don't get that much out of them. Thirdly, and most seriously, a small number of people have very strong negative psychological reactions (most often if they jump straight into something like a week-long silent retreat with no prior training). Luckily, there's another method of meditation called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/68294.html">"Discursive Meditation"</a>, which I learned from John Michael Greer. This method has a long history, tremendous benefits, and pretty much perfect safety.
</p>

<p>
Here's how to do it: sit up straight in a chair, breathe deeply, and spend several minutes thinking about a specific theme of spiritual/philosophical significance. That's it! If you'd like more detail, check out the link above for a series of posts that lay it out step by step. You get all the good of training your attention not to wander, breathing deeply, and paying attention to your posture, while also giving your thinking mind a good workout as well. I've tried a wide variety of <a href="https://courses.liveanddare.com/limitless-life-meditation">meditation techniques</a>, and this one has been by far the most rewarding for me. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but think over giving it a shot. It's easy, safe, and works equally well whatever your spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) may be.

<h4 id="org183b21b">Express Romantic Interest First, Friendliness Later</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org183b21b">
<p>
Given the expectations and norms of our current culture, this one might be most useful for heterosexual males, but I hope it's helpful to whoever might need it. Many young folks, when they find themselves romantically interested in someone take an approach of "let's get to be friends, and then I'll ask her/him out later". This sounds reasonable, but is actually a terrible plan born of cowardice. Yes, I know, harsh, but that harshness comes from my own bitter experience of trying to follow this plan back in the day. Basically, asking someone out is scary, and we scramble to  mitigate that fear any way we can. It seems like asking someone out will be less scary if we know the other person already likes us as a friend. Plausible, but crap. Being friends is not the same as being lovers, they're different relationships with different dynamics and different needs. Of course, there is <i>some</i> overlap, but it's actually easier to go from "we went on a date and there wasn't any chemistry" to "so let's just be friends" than it is to go from "we feel comfortable together as friends" to "so do you want to risk ruining that with awkwardness by going on a date?" So, if there's someone you think you might want to date, ask them out instead of trying to be friends first.

So yes, kids aren't for everyone, and you definitely shouldn't have a kid if you aren't ready or don't really want one, but overall, kids are pretty great. I wanted to state this explicitly, because from the outside, it's easy to see what sucks about having kids: they take your time, they're expensive, they throw fits, they cover you in snot and get you sick, and so on. The thing is, from the outside, it's also harder to see what is great about having kids: watching a human gradually come online, seeing your own facial expressions mirrored back to you, having someone who feels emotions more intensely than you even know how to run up, throw their arms around you, and bury their face in your shoulder. There is absolutely nothing like it.

<h4 id="org7462fe6">Learn from the Stoics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7462fe6">
<p>
There's a lot of great stuff in ancient philosophy, but if I had to pick one thing that's most helpful, it would be the core insight of Stoicism: "you can't control what happens to you, but you <i>can</i> control how you react to it". Simple to state, hard to live. Someone cuts you off in traffic? You didn't make that happen, but you have full control over whether you get mad, how mad you get, and what you do because you're mad. Again, I know, easier said that done. And the Stoics acknowledged that you might not be able to stop that initial flare of anger from appearing, but <i>you are not your emotions</i>. They are something that happen to you, and you can choose to engage with them or distance yourself from them. Sometimes anger is useful, because it motivates you to right wrongs. Other times it just stresses you out for no reason. Learning to get inside your own cognitive processes like this is enormously helpful. Instead of being jerked around by whatever emotion happens to flare up due to circumstances, you can decide to steer your life based on whatever values you find truly important.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org93ede19">
<p>
Most folks say that time is your most valuable resource, but I'd tweak that to say that <i>attention</i> is your most valuable resource. We've all had hours or days or weeks where we didn't do much and felt vaguely crappy afterwards. We've also all had experiences of intense, focused attention, maybe only for a few minutes, that have stuck with us as peak moments. Time may be the quantitative measure of your finitude in this existence, but attention is the qualitative. Where I'm going with all this high-flying philosophy is that you should be utterly ruthless in guarding your attention from anyone and anything that tries to grab it without your express, willed intent. Ever had a pleasant evening spoiled when you got an text from someone wanting you to deal with some problem for them? Ever been right in the middle of straightening out a complicated argument in your head when an email alert has popped up and you lose that almost-there insight? Ever been at dinner with a date, you're really getting into the conversation, and then they check their phone? Notifications destroy the quality of whatever they interrupt, even if you don't do anything else with them right away. It's even worse when the notifications try to further hijack your attention - taking you to a social media post that is at the top of a rabbit hole you go down for hours or to a news story that freaks you out and ruins your mood for a whole weekend. Notifications are evil. Turn as many of them off as you can possibly get away with. Put your attention where <i>you</i> want it to go, and keep it there for as long as <i>you</i> decide.

<h4 id="org3403aea">Spend Some Time Outside</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3403aea">
<p>
This one really is this simple: every day if you can, but at least once a week, go spend some time sitting or walking outdoors. If you can get somewhere with plants and animals, go there. If not, consider moving somewhere less hellish, but in the meantime, sun or moon and sky will do just fine. Most of us spend most of our lives in large boxes looking at smaller, brighter boxes, focusing on an abstract world of words, images, and thoughts. As such, we have very little connection to the actual, physical world that keeps us alive. So, go outside. This shouldn't be some doleful chore (though, on some days in the summer in Texas, it can feel that way). Go feel the warm sun on your face, watch squirrels get frisky, check out good-looking guys or gals. Fifteen or twenty minutes is great if you can get it, but even just a handful of minutes can do wonders.

<div id="outline-container-org6d04776" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6d04776">Don't "Follow Your Passion"</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6d04776">
<p>
This is the core idea in Cal Newport's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love-9781455509126/9781455509126">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. "Follow your passion" was a rallying cry for Baby Boomers who had followed the overly-conservative career advice of parents who lived through the Great Depression, and it was useful for getting folks used to the idea that maybe you shouldn't be miserable at your job if you can help it. Unfortunately, it was going too far to suggest that everyone has some deep, inborn passion that they just need to discover and their whole life will fall into place. Sure, some folks have these life-defining passions, but most of them figure that out pretty young. You ever met someone who can't help but draw, no matter what? That guy's got a passion, he doesn't need the advice to find it. Most of us don't have that. Instead, most of us <i>become</i> passionate about whatever we get <i>good at</i>. So, Newport recommends you find some skills that are both rare and valuable and then get good at them. Rare so that you're not a dime a dozen, and valuable so that other people will actually pay for it. Some examples: crafting ships in bottles is rare, but not so valuable. Being a decent, but not great, computer programmer is fairly valuable, but not that rare. So, if you want a challenging, meaningful career, find something hard to get good at that's in demand, and then get good at that. Once you do, you'll have more control over what you do, who you work for, and what you achieve.

<h4 id="org092d865">Learn a Craft</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org092d865">
<p>
Learn how to make something with your hands - scarves, bread, motorcycle engines, whatever grabs you. If you don't know what you might like making, try a wide variety of crafts (remember Divergence and Convergence?). Pay attention to what seems interesting even when you're not good at it (for me, that's woodcarving). Then take some classes, watch some videos, find a club, or whatever works - learn the skills you need and then make the time to do it. Getting really good might take a lot of work, but you can get to "just fine" in many things with very little practice: for example, I bet you could go from "bread comes from a shelf in the store" to baking tasty loaves in 2 or 3 tries, tops. The goal here is not to become an artisan and quit your job to do glassblowing full time (though, if you can make that work, more power to you). The point is to concentrate deeply and engage with something outside of yourself in the real world. You'll find there's a big difference between imagining what it takes to turn water, flour, and yeast into dough versus feeling a sticky substance and smooshing it around until it feels right. Not only is it helpful to ground yourself like this, it is <i>hugely</i> enjoyable! If you've never "lost yourself" in something you cared about, then you are truly missing out. Of the most meaningful things in my life, almost all of them involved this kind of focused attention.

<h4 id="orgf7af6ae">Make the Right Thing Easier</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf7af6ae">
<p>
I learned this from the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-house-that-cleans-itself/9780736949873">The House that Cleans Itself</a>  by Mindy Starns Clark. If you have tried something multiple times with the best of intentions, but for some reason it won't stick,  "I'll do it again, but this time I'll just try harder" is most likely a losing strategy. Instead, find a way to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, mail used to pile up on the credenza by the door. So, my wife and I put a two-drawer inbox on the credenza and a recycling bin next to it. Now, it's easy to sort what's mine or hers, and any junk mail goes right in the recycling. Apparently, it was too hard to walk the 15 feet to the main recycling bin, but it's not too hard to drop it within arm's reach. Go figure. Seriously, sometimes the tweaks that make something doable will be downright embarrassing. You can apply this concept in lots of areas of your life: set up automatic savings, don't have junk food in the house, put your alarm where you have to get out of bed to turn it off, have charging cables everywhere you might need to charge your phone, and so forth. There <i>are</i> some things where the answer is training your willpower, but more often than you might think, you can find a way to make it easier to win.

<h4 id="orgcfc584b">Fake It Till You Make It</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcfc584b">
<p>
This advice has become much more widespread of late, but allow me to reiterate: you will not be good at something when you start. You get good at it by doing it. Humans are imitative animals, so if you want to be good at something, act as much like someone who is good at it as you can, and then keep at it. Eventually, the act will become the reality (likely far before you believe it). Don't put anybody at risk, of course, but it is almost always much safer to risk failing than you're afraid it is.

<h4 id="orge446567">Drink Water</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge446567">
<p>
If you're anything like me, you might have grown up drinking too much other liquid (like Dr. Pepper) and not enough water. Luckily, the Army beat this out of me, so I now take hydration very seriously. If you don't drink much water, you will be <i>shocked</i> at how much better you feel if you get enough. Here's how to do it: buy a 1 quart bottle that you will find convenient to carry around pretty much everywhere. Set a goal of drinking 2 of these a day (more if you do something that makes you sweat much). Set specific times/events by which to empty the bottle - for example "I'll drink one by lunch time and the next one by the end of the work day". If you find yourself getting light-headed, add a <i>tiny</i> pinch of salt to one or both bottles. If you are thirsty, add a 3rd or 4th bottle. If you drink any alcohol, consider going for that 3rd or 4th bottle just in case, and make sure you get some salt either in food or added to your water. Seriously, if you haven't been getting enough water, you have no idea how much it helps: headaches, tiredness, muscle growth, weight loss - all better with water.

<h4 id="orgbaf987e">Stretch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbaf987e">
<p>
Most of us far more time sitting than our bodies are built for (see the point about How to Stand/Sit), which leaves us stiff. So get some stretching in your life. You can experiment, but here are a few good options to try out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AakYeM23sI">Sun Salutations</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_bY6REpIPE">Five Rites</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHnN0pBKM4n4x7wI90zg-Od0hSOKawwJ">Daily Dozen</a> , <a href="https://coursetolife.com/courses/gymnasticbodies-fundamentals-f1-pro-bundle/">Gymnastic Strength Training Daily Limber</a>. Whatever you pick, pay special attention to your back, since that's where a lot of the bad effects of sitting show up, but it's all linked up, so find a whole body routine. If you have a more intensive stretching practice, like Yoga or Gymnastic training or the like, then that's awesome, but even if you are otherwise a couch potato, do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes stretching every day.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb5dde42">
<p>
Okay, this one is best done by demonstration, but it's important enough that I didn't want to leave it out here. As folks who spend far too much time sitting, we are all bad at standing, which paradoxically also makes us bad at sitting. We stand and sit in ways that damage our skeletons and circulatory systems, so it'd be great to fix that. If you want to go <i>real</i> deep, check out <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deskbound-1-standing-up-to-a-sitting-world/9781628600582">Deskbound: Standing Up to a Sitting World</a> by Dr. Kelly Starrett, which is where I got this checklist for proper standing:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Feet</i>: Plant your feet, toes straight forward (not out to the side or pointed inward) about hip-width apart.</li>
<li><i>Knees</i>: Very slightly tense your muscles as if trying to turn your toes outward while keeping your heels planted, but don't let your toes actually move. You should feel this as a slight tension in your knees, which this movement stabilizes.</li>
<li><i>Hips</i>: Tense your butt cheeks to do a humping motion with your hips, moving your tail bone down and forward. For a less crude metaphor, imagine that your hips are a cup and that you don't want to pour any liquid out the front. This stabilizes your hips.</li>
<li><i>Lower Back</i>: Gently tense your abs, about 1/3 of full tension, pulling them back toward your spine</li>
<li><i>Upper Back</i>: Rotate your arms in your shoulder sockets. To do this, with your hands at your sides, rotate them until your thumbs face forward.</li>
<li><i>Head</i>: Move your head a bit forward and backward and feel for the spot where it's sitting right on top of the stable pillar you just made from the ground up.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations, you are now standing the way your body was designed for! Keeping your body in this position every waking hour is a bit much, but I use this process as a handy check-in to "reset" when I notice myself slouching.
</p>

<p>
To sit, just do steps 4-6, but you'll notice it's much harder. Your legs, and especially your hips, are doing a lot of the work of maintaining good posture when you stand, and when you sit, you basically don't have them to help.

<b>By Gary Klein</b>

<p>
The very same things are what excited me and disappointed me the most in this book. It presents intuition as a very no-nonsense ability that is critical for effective decision making, and gives advice on how to train to be better at it. Exactly what I wanted! On the other hand, it describes "intuition" as simply the ability to learn to detect patterns and apply past experiences to current situations, without consciously realizing  you've made that match - which is rather less romantic than I might hope for something as big and spooky as "intuition" to be. Once I set aside my childish disappointment, though, I found this book to be full of gems, and more importantly, to include detailed instructions on how to practice and train your team on these skills. I was expecting some help on decision making and ended up walking away with great techniques for leadership and creativity as well.

<p>
While book clubs are great for getting everybody on the same page (har har), a <i>Bizarro</i> Book Club is a way to inject more diversity into your intellectual life. I’ve talked before about the importance of high quality <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#maximize_the_value_of_your_inputs">inputs</a> to your creativity, and this is my favorite new method for finding stuff that I would never have on my own. It combines the traditional social benefits of a book club with a much more exciting way of engaging with books, and it’s just as easy to do.  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7fa842d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7fa842d">Everyday Book Clubs: the Good and the Bad</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7fa842d">
<p>
With your everyday book club, the best bit is that everyone gets to share a common experience. For many, book clubs are little more than an excuse for a regular get together where everyone has something to talk about. How many times have you heard folks admit they don’t talk much about the book and instead gossip the whole time? Don’t get me wrong - that sounds like a great time! Even when they are basically just low key parties, traditional book clubs are great for building and maintaining friendships. What’s more, if your friends really <i>do</i> care about the books, you can get some real depth from differing points of view on the same work. The discussion allows everyone to realize things they hadn’t and to leave with a better appreciation for what they got out of the book. So there’s a hell of a lot to recommend book clubs. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, book clubs can have some shortcomings. For one thing, unless your group forms around shared tastes, someone is likely not to enjoy any given book picked by the group, which makes them less likely to have a good time or to bring worthwhile insights to the group. For another, any time you get folks together to talk about the same thing, they can all too easily fall prey to groupthink - somebody says something that sounds reasonable, and there’s no more discussion or debate. If you start a book club to broaden your mind, these weaknesses can bring on two different failures. First, if you form a group with shared tastes, you’re likely only going to read stuff that you were likely to find on your own, and your fellow members are more likely to think like you do, leading to groupthink. Secondly, if your group is made up of friends or neighbors, you’re more likely to run into books that you don’t like and to have a boring discussions about them.

<h3 id="orge81d63d">My Answer: the Bizarro Book Club</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge81d63d">
<p>
Altogether, these risks are not a big deal if your goal is to drink some wine and hang out. When it comes to reading, though, I am something of a crazy person. I want more from my recurring book-focused events than booze and chit chat. So I had an idea: create a book club to <i>my</i> specifications, and rope my friends into it. Drawn by the innocuous name of “book club”, little would they realize how cunningly I had led them into my selfish trap. 
</p>

<p>
Here’s what I came up with: gather my most interesting reader friends, with rather different tastes, and each read a <i>different</i> book. Then, share what we got out of the book and discuss. I know these folks well enough to know they are careful readers and the ways our views differ, so their summaries are both high quality and reliable. When I discuss my own book, they make connections to other works that I’ve never heard of. Even better, the books they bring are those I <i>never</i> would have heard of on my own. Imagine if you could go on Goodreads and get a summary of a book that was guaranteed to be interesting, useful, and relevant to <i>you</i> - what a deal! Or if you whenever you made a note while reading, a little link appeared to a something that you (and the author) had never heard of before? This “Bizarro Book Club” was a way to hit the sweet spot between exposure to new thoughts and enough context for those thoughts to be meaningful.

<h3 id="orge356118">Your Challenge: Try It Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge356118">
<p>
So, my challenge to you: try out a Bizarro Book Club for yourself! 
</p>

<p>
Here are the details on how to make one work:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find at least two friends who love to read (preferably with varied tastes)</li>
<li>Set up a regular get together, every month or so, that works for most of the group most of the time (we’re all over the country, so we use Google Hangouts, and Calendly)</li>
<li>Tell everybody to come ready to talk about a different book (they can share what they’re planning to avoid overlap and get excited)</li>
<li>If at least two people show up, that’s a quorum (try to make sure <i>something</i> happens every time you’re scheduled - that kind of consistency is important to keep something like this going)</li>
<li>Talk about your books! (Maybe set a time limit for each person/book to get to everybody)</li>
<li>If anyone gets so excited by a book discussed that they want to read it too, that’s okay, but they have to bring at least one new insight</li>
<li>BONUS: To be your group’s hero, take notes to share (especially appreciated by those who couldn’t make it)</li>
<li>DOUBLE DARE BONUS: Allow members to dare each other to read specific books (basically each member gives someone else a homework assignment)</li>
</ol>

<p>
We’ve met a few times so far, and it has worked beautifully - even better than I could have hoped for. I’ve learned so much new stuff and walked away with deeper insights and connections for my own books. Everybody else has had the same reaction. It gladdens my heart that it has exceeded all of my high expectations, and I can’t wait to keep making it even better. If you love to read, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, you won’t be disappointed.

<b>By Alain de Botton</b>
</p>

<p>
This book provides a great overview of the tradition of Western philosophy. Besides providing useful summaries of some of the major thinkers and what their philosophy can do for you in your life, it shows the the connecting threads between thinkers that might seem totally unrelated at first glance. Each chapter gives a brief thumbnail of the biography and thinking of a major philosopher, which is great, but what's really useful about this book is that every chapter addresses a specific concern that everyone faces - such as unpopularity, money, and frustration. Alain's style is warm and gentle, with a hint of detached humor that makes for enjoyable reading. If you've ever thought "I wish I knew more about philosophy", this is the place to start.

Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my "operating manuals" for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality.

<b>By Julia Cameron</b>
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that if I picked this book up sight unseen and flipped through it, I would likely have put it back on the shelf - it has a lot of markers for being a bit too "woo woo" or "touchy feely" for my usual tastes. Fortunately, it came highly recommended by a bunch of well-grounded people that I respect, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. The basic premise is that everyone can be creative, but most of us have developed the idea that we're not allowed to or have otherwise blocked our access to our creative selves. To counteract this, it provides a twelve week guided program to lead to greater creativity. I'm not very far into the program, but already I am seeing the benefit of its two core habits: <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> and <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/">Artist Dates</a>. If you are already convinced that you could be more creative with some help and don't need as much back up, consider going straight to the workbook.

Man oh man am I loving this book. It puts out a comprehensive record of thinking about the concept of strategy in western thought from the Bible and Homer all the way to modern theorists. Along the way, Freedman provides analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various formulations and their applications. Despite what might turn into a dry, intellectual subject, the book is quite clear and readable, moving briskly through trends and eras of thought. For me, it's greatest value is highlighting the connections and influences between figures as disparate as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and John Boyd. I suspect that I will be coming back to my notes on this and its bibliography for years to come.

Besides being a phenomenal "learn to cook from nothing" cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn anything. Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn't done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it's rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in The 4 Hour Workweek and The 4 Hour Body, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other "how to learn" frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you're already a master cook, check this book out for it's advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.

I mentioned this book in my post on <a href="#storytelling_part_5-resources_for_digging_deeper">Storytelling Resources</a>, but I thought it deserved its own call out. An incredibly slim book, you can read and understand it in an evening, but will likely return to it again and again. This book clearly lays out the rules of modern American usage and style, favoring concise, vigorous prose. Even if you enjoy waxing more eloquent, this provides a great starting place from which to depart. It's also admirably organized, with a detailed table of contents and clear headings for the rules it propounds, making it ideal as a reference work (which it will be for the vast majority of its usefulness, since it will only take an hour or two to read it the first time). If you write at all for your living or for pleasure, you should have this book in easy reach at all times.

<p>
<b>By Walter Isaacson</b>
</p>

<p>
I have long irrationally avoided biographies, despite encountering a few excellent ones like Team of Rivals, so I decided I needed to remedy that to read one about a personal hero of mine. Leonardo stands as the archetypal "Renaissance Man", with achievements in art, architecture, science and more all under his belt. His brilliant and beautiful notebooks make any journaler feel inadequate. And yet, one of the most reassuring parts of this book is that it seems unlikely that Leonardo was as set apart intellectually as an Einstein or a Newton, nor as naturally artistically gifted as a Michaelangelo. Instead, Leonardo learned everything through a combination of insatiable curiosity and determined attention and focus. He was also able to turn his varied interests and propensity for abandoning projects into a firm set of multidisciplinary knowledge that spurred creative insight across fields. So he's something of a role model for those of us who worry we didn't win the genetic lottery or feel a lack of focus. This book is fantastic and humanizing while still highlighting the key takeaways from his life that we can enjoy in our own.

<p>
I’ve done my best to share a fantastic beginner’s guide to storytelling with this series, but there is a lot of depth to all of the topics that I’ve touched on. Below, I provide my recommendations on resources for digging into Story Structure, Effective Practice, Public Speaking, Oral Storytelling, Writing, and Visual Storytelling. In each section, I’ve provided a handful of my favorite “how to” resources, whether books, blogs, videos, or courses along with a section of illustrative examples applying the lessons you’ll learn from the how to books. These lists are by no means exhaustive, and if I’ve missed any of your favorite works on storytelling, please let me know, as I am always hungry for new insights on the topic.

The Story Grid by Shawn Coyne
</p>

<p>
If you want to dive deep into structure and how to put together a story that works, you could do a lot worse than to read The Story Grid. Shawn Coyne takes an editor’s approach to figuring out the nuts and bolts of what “works” in a story or not. The book focuses mostly on fiction, but he has regular blog posts and further material at the website that apply it to all sorts of other examples.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org802a231" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org802a231">The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org802a231">
<p>
I dare you to time how long you can read about story structure without Joseph Campbell coming up. This book is where he lays out the fundamental structure shared by almost every enduring mythological tale across the world. Something about this sort of story speaks to the fundamental human experience, and has been for at least thousands of years. If you’ve ever heard of a “hero’s journey” or the “monomyth”, this book is where that comes from.

<div id="outline-container-org0491600" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org0491600">Save the Cat by Blake Snyder</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org0491600">
<p>
Blake Snyder devotes his book to the end-to-end process of writing a screenplay, and so contains a lot of material not directly related to structure, but it has a rock-solid basic approach to thinking about structure, and even better, hands-on details about how to actually do that. My personal favorite thing from the book is “The Board” - a board you put up on the wall that shows the breakdown into acts, on which you place index cards for each scene, and for each scene you track the change in emotional charge and what the conflict is. The Story Grid covers a lot of the same ground, but they are useful to compare and cherry pick from.

<h5 id="org89b37cf">On the Shapes of Stories by Kurt Vonnegut</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org89b37cf">
<p>
This delightful (and short) video shares both Vonnegut’s clear understanding of story structure as well as his wit. I recommend watching it a few times: the first time to enjoy it as an entertaining presentation, and then again to realize “oh wait, there’s actually something there.”

<h5 id="org9b029f2">Mythology by Edith Hamilton</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9b029f2">
<p>
If you want to see the basic myths that Campbell was talking about, there are fewer better presentations than Edith Hamilton’s collection of Greek myths. Academically rigorous but easy to read, this is the “one book” on classical mythology.

<h5 id="org9a4c738">Tootsie</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9a4c738">
<p>
Screenwriting classes love to use Tootsie as an example, because it’s just a good, solid story with a structure that works. Every scene moves the story forward, every scene has a shift in emotional charge, every scene has conflict, and the character grows exactly the way we want to see him do so.

<h5 id="org5b15071">A Christmas Story</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5b15071">
<p>
I am especially tickled to point to this example because it is framed as a narrator telling a story - aren’t we all so meta. Every anecdote in the seemingly scattered remembrances of the narrator actually contributes to the overall story, following that Red Rider BB gun. It’s extremely tight and on point the whole time, which helps to explain why people happily re-watch every year.

<h5 id="org855fb53">Pulp Fiction</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org855fb53">
<p>
Another favorite of film nerds, Pulp Fiction serves as a great example of how structure does not equal chronology. Tartantino chooses to show us scenes based on what he wants us to know about the character at the time, which means that he can’t rely on normal causality to carry the plot along if he gets the sequencing wrong. We’re left with a movie where we buy into the plight of a lot of pretty bad dudes and enjoy struggling along with them.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org248fe58" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org248fe58">The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org248fe58">
<p>
Okay, this one is by the far the nerdiest thing I’m recommending, but hear me out. Each one of these novels works as a tightly structured hard boiled detective story - all the obligatory scenes and genre conventions are there in ways that are both satisfyingly familiar and intriguingly new. At the same time, each book builds the overall character arc of its titular protagonist, Harry Dresden (spoiler alert) and calls back to previous novels in both expected and unexpected ways. The quality certainly improves over the course of the series, but even the first few books are enjoyable stand alone detective stories.

<p>
What does cooking have to do with Storytelling? Not much, but the first section of this book breaks down Tim’s recipe for deconstructing a new skill to learn and how to maximize the value of your practice. I like to think I’ve done a lot of the deconstructing and sequencing work for you on Storytelling with this series, but it’s a meta-skill worth learning. As an added bonus, if you don’t already know how to cook, this is the best learn-to-cook cookbook ever written.

<h5 id="org70bff38">The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle</h5>

<p>
Short and to the point, Coyle distills the lessons he has learned from neuroscientists, coaches, and performers for building world-class talent into short tips. The book is helpfully organized into sections focused on getting started, building skills effectively, and maintaining motivation when it gets hard. Intended as a quick reference to be carried around and looked at again and again, this book won’t convince you that deliberate practice is the way to get great if you don’t already believe it, but it will help you immensely in actually doing the work.

<p>
Josh Waitzkin is terrifyingly brilliant and has an amazing ability to learn new fields to highest levels of mastery. His book is one of my personal operating manuals, and every time I return to it, I realize that I didn’t understand it as well as I thought before. His section on “Making Smaller Circles” is especially relevant for how to approach practice once you’ve already identified the skill or had the basic insight you need to work on.

<p>
While there are lots of works on improving your memory and even on memory competition, I chose to highlight Joshua Foer’s because it focuses on his own journey going from having no idea such as a thing as “mental athletics” existed to himself competing and succeeding as one. It provides a really impressive example of what you can achieve by learning the right way to practice and following through.

Dramatized, of course, but the true story of someone with some pretty serious challenges to telling stories working his butt off to get it right.

<p>
We’ve talked about this book before, but it is the best “one stop shop” on how to go from zero to giving great presentations I’ve seen. It discusses, structure, practice, and delivery in ways that will be familiar to you from this series, and has a great recommended reading list at the end, with some of the same titles you’ll see here. I especially appreciate its emphasis on tying together the spoken message and whatever visuals you are presenting, and how they can reinforce each other to create a stronger whole.

<p>
There are a lot of different courses offered by Dale Carnegie Training these days, some focused more specifically on public speaking than others, but the underlying principle for all of them is to better understand and empathize with other people as human beings. I have not taken one of their courses yet, but I’ve heard nothing but good things and its on my list.

<p>
Another recommendation that I have to provide on the strength of what I’ve heard, this is the best known way to make sure you get a lot more chances to speak in public and learn by doing. They have clubs all over the world and create a supportive environment for people to build their skills as a speaker and get meaningful feedback. If you don’t have a job that requires a lot of presentations (or if you do and are hungry for even more), this is a great way to get your reps in.

<p>
This article provides a nice overview of how to approach improving your public speaking, and goes into more specifics than we’ve covered in this general series on storytelling. The thing I like the most about it are the links - each section provides a basic overview, but there are a lot of links to dive deeper on specific topics as needed. That’s not all - the article linked is part of a series on giving presentations, which itself is part of a series on Communication skills. Mindtools has a pretty smart nesting and linking of related skills and makes a great resource for a motivated learner.

Otherwise known as “Fake it ’til you become it, this is one of my favorite TED talks of all time, and is applicable to much more than just public speaking. It talks about the feedback loop created by our body language, the mental states they create, and what we believe about ourselves. Does public speaking terrify you? If so, the cure is to adopt the posture and body language of someone triumphant and powerful to counteract your natural scared body language. It sounds nuts, but it works.

One of the most famous speeches of all time. Notice how different the cadence and emphasis were than a modern politician would use. This guy knew he had your attention for the next 12 minutes, and he made sure to convey the gravitas the occasion demanded. I wouldn’t recommend that you try to copy Churchill’s style today, but take a look at the differences in assumptions about delivery and style between then and now, and ask yourself if you really want to stick with yours.

It gets you used to finding relevant connections with other people and spinning them into a story, and also teaches you to read what’s working for your audience and what’s not. Plus, you’ll bomb a few times, which feels terrible, but then you keep going and you realize it’s not a big deal, which is crucial to build the confidence to tell entertaining stories with enough verve.

Podcasts are another favorite form of verbal storytelling for me, because they have to be good enough to work without visuals of any kind. Carlin does a remarkable job of calling up vivid images in your mind of the events he describes and invites you to empathize with the actual lived experience of the human beings that were there. Really good stuff, but be forewarned: most episodes are better named “audiobooks” and run several hours long. Perfect for long drives, not so great for bite sized enjoyment.

My wife turned me on to this one, where Mahnke recounts historically attested tales of weird and creepy stuff. Most of the stories are not (and cannot be) verified as actually happening, but all of them are things that people at least said actually happened - you know, folklore. Even though Mahnke’s cadence includes the occasional hilariously inexplicable pause, he effectively holds your interest and builds tension to creepy climax of each episode. Unlike Hardcore History, these are usually just the right length for listening while doing chores or making a commute.

This one is the definitive guide to what American authors mean when they say “good writing”. It’s quite brief at a whole 85 pages, and contains advice on everything from comma usage to word choice. Anyone who has ever told you to get rid of unnecessary words, use the active voice, and to prefer the plainest way of saying something possible was speaking in the tradition of Strunk.

The classic work by one of the most popular and successful authors of all time, King knows a thing or two about telling stories via the printed word. Like his fiction, the prose is direct, clear, and keeps up a good clip.

<p>
A wonderfully pragmatic book that focuses on the importance of how you say it when most of are laser focused on what it is we want to say. While the thrust of the book is on persuasion, as Luntz has worked as a marketer and political speechwriter, the advice to choose your words based on the impact they will have on your audience applies to anything that relies on words. I find it especially useful to compare and contrast with The Elements of Style, which is predominantly focused on aesthetics rather than persuasion.

In this brief work, Pressfield takes the lessons he’s learned writing in different fields - advertising, screenplays, fiction, non-fiction, and self help - and how he applies them across the board. The title reveals the most important lesson: people are busy and don’t want to read anything unless there’s a reason it is compellingly interesting to them - which means you need to develop some serious empathy to get anywhere as a writer. Funny how that keeps popping up about storytelling, right?

I’ve referenced Pressfield several times in this series, because I so much enjoy his writing on writing. His blog provides more frequent and bite size doses of what you get in his books. If you aren’t sold on War of Art or Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t from my description, pop over to his blog for “Writing Wednesdays” to get a good feel for tone, style, and content.

<p>
This is a much more “literary” book than I usually read and enjoy, but it’s dream-like descriptions of bizarre cities are extremely vivid and compelling. There’s a “twist” at the end that most people know before they come to the book, but honestly, I just enjoyed it for imagining the impossible cities as real fantastic places, and enjoying the near-poetic language used to bring them to life.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga5dd429">
<p>
Most of my examples here of good writing are fiction, because most non-fiction writers must split their effort between getting good at writing and getting good at whatever they’re writing about, whereas fiction authors can focus almost entirely on the craft of making good prose. Steven Johnson’s early works show the signs of that division of labor - Emergence covers absolutely fascinating material and makes extremely valuable connections, but it gets a big clunky to follow at times. His more recent works, however, expertly weave together the disparate facts and insights he shares with you. Honestly, I could have picked from several books, but I like Where Good Ideas Come From the best.

<p>
Steven Pressfield may not be a Proust or a Hemingway, but I enjoy his books a lot more. Gates of Fire does a great job of describing action in an exciting way while simultaneously exploring the nature of fear, bravery, and loyalty. Required reading at most American military academies and incredibly popular in the special operations community, this is one of the best written books on leadership you can pick up.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org902e170">
<p>
Again, most folks would not point to Neal Stephenson as a prose stylist, but this book is the perfect example of nailing  the execution of a techno-political thriller. As I’ve mentioned before, Stephenson is one of my favorite authors, and I’ve read all of his books, so this one especially stood out by being different in style to his others. The long, information-rich digressions that I so love from Snow Crash and The Baroque Cycle are completely missing here, because this book is all about creating tension and then ratcheting it up relentlessly. Other than Breaking Bad, I have never seen such an expert display of continually increasing stakes: imagine an infinite sequence of falling out of frying pans into fires into frying pans and so on.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc74b18a">
<p>
For those of you not familiar with comics, Will Eisner is the guy after whom their biggest award is named - he started writing comics in New York in the 30’s when his high school buddy Bob Kane (creator of Batman) suggested he give it a go, coined the term “graphic novel”, and worked hard to argue and prove that comics could tell  serious stories and were a legitimate literary form. This book takes what he learned from his decades of experience creating and teaching sequential art and distills it into a guide to make sure the visuals are always in service to the story - and not the other way around. Beautifully illustrated (duh) and cogently written, this book is useful for anyone who needs to convey messages with a combination of words and images, not just artists and flimmakers.

<h5 id="org3dfb6bc">Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3dfb6bc">
<p>
This is another meta-work: a comic book about comic books. Why am I harping on comics so much here? Well besides being a big nerd and enjoying them quite a lot, they provide an excellent comparison point to writing (nothing but words) and movies (moving pictures combined with spoken words) that allows examination of what is the same and what is different - and McCloud does exactly that. The central conceptual point of the work is that comic readers are active participants in the creation of the story, because they have to fill in the gaps between every frame. Writers and filmmakers can pull off that trick if they try, but with comics it is absolutely essential and pervasive. That creates a medium with a unique form of engagement worth exploring.

I found this video when I was looking for examples of composition and pacing done well for the post on Delivery and was immediately hooked. As my previous posts have made no effort to hide, I’m a big fan of everything Genndy Tartakovsky does, and this explained how he does it with remarkable clarity and great examples. I’ve since watched several episodes of Samurai Jack and keep noticing the three techniques identified here. As with comics, I like analyses of animation as a way of learning about film, because the lack of human actors and overt stylization allows you to focus on form and composition and such like very purely.

While this book is not about storytelling exactly, it is about learning to understand and use “visual language”, which can greatly improve communication and understanding, particularly of abstract concepts. This book addresses many of the challenges with learning and using visual language, from people not even stopping to consider it all the way to insecurity over artistic or creative ability hindering visual output. It provides a lot of very concrete guidance on how and when to use visual language in business and personal settings, all without being good at art. Pairs extremely well with Show and Tell above and Gamestorming.

I love Samurai Jack, but these shorts combine Tartakovsky’s stylistic elements described in the video linked above with my lifelong love of Star Wars. Taken as a whole, I “joke” that these are my favorite prequel. Originally aired as 3 minute (later expanded to 15 minute) shorts between programs on Cartoon Network, these are incredibly tight little self contained stories that nonetheless build into an overall picture of the Clone War, seamlessly linking the end of Attack of the Clones with the beginning of The Revenge of the Sith. Even if you are not a fan of Star Wars, check out the expert use of environments, composition, and carefully choreographed fight scenes.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb5990f9">
<p>
As the only Zack Snyder film I completely enjoy, I give full credit to Frank Miller for the original, which Snyder very directly adapted. Yes, this is the second time Thermopylae has come up in the examples here, but that is to be expected from a classicist infantryman. The graphic novel showcases Miller’s high-contrast style and impressive composition, but also uses size and placement of frames/panels to expertly pull you through the story. It is also just as much a story about storytelling as less gory titles like The Sandman - about the story Western Europe tells itself about its past, the stories a culture tells itself about its values, and the stories we tell ourselves to link our past with our present.

<p>
This movie is visually stunning. It came out in 1964 and I first saw it in 2017, and more than 50 years later, it still looks fantastic.  Not “good for its time” but “good for all movies ever made” in a way that is unfortunately rare. It treats us to not one, but four separate expertly told traditional Japanese ghost stories. It’s not an especially scary movie, but it is riveting and beautiful. I recommend it as an example of visual storytelling because for those of us who are American, it removes familiar cultural and artistic conventions and stands on the strength of its craft as a film alone.

<b>By Will Eisner</b>
</p>

<p>
Written by a giant of the sequential art field, this book covers the insights from decades of creating and teaching about the use of comics to tell stories. Eisner defends and establishes the usefulness and seriousness of the form as a literary medium, capable of addressing themes and issues that matter. The central tenet of the book is that the visuals must be shaped by the needs of the story and not the other way around - otherwise you get lured into meaningless set pieces that serve no purpose but to show off something that looks good. It covers a lot of the same ground as the other works we've discussed on Storytelling, but does so with beautiful illustrations (duh) and a very different focus than works addressed primarily to crafters of prose.

Tim Ferriss recommended this book for writers of all kinds, despite its focus on screenwriting. I came to it in order to get a variety of perspectives on storytelling (speaking, writing fiction, writing screenplays, and so forth). Despite the fact that I often watch movies and think "I could have written something better than that!", I have no particular ambition to become a screenwriter, but I have nonetheless found this little book quite helpful. It's advice to get really clear about what your story is about applies across the board, and I appreciate its brass tacks focus on the fact that for anybody to ever experience your fantastic art, you have to sell it, which means people have to want to buy it. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a quick, fun read on how to write punchy things that get people's attention.

We've talked before about War of Art and it's discussion of Resistance, the force within us that stops us from creating and achieving what we might. Well, Turning Pro is Pressfield's "how to" on overcoming that force, and it mostly comes down to doggedly showing up to do the work every day, regardless of how inspired you're feeling. While I find War of Art more inspirational overall, this work is a great companion that gives you concrete steps of what to do when you commit to following the advice in WoA.

This book has been on my list for a long time, but I only just now got around to reading it, and man was I missing out! It breaks down the mysterious art of writing a story that "works" into comprehensible and testable steps. That's what I think is most remarkable about this book: not that it tells you the components of a story that works (we've been getting that since Aristotle), but that it gives you tools to tighten up the feedback loop on your stories - you can evaluate your success or failure and make adjustments using these tools. You still have to put in the work and get inspired by the Muse, but all of the guesswork is removed. It has a really strong emphasis on writing fiction, but the lessons are applicable to any sort of storytelling.

I've been using the approach outlined in this book for years now, thanks to some fantastic mentors at work, but I only just got around to reading it. I don't know what took me so long to get to it - it was great, and it only took me a little over two hours to read even taking a lot of notes. The basic premise of the book is that you should tell the truth, you should tell it as a story, and you should present the story with pictures as much as possible. It goes into more detail on how to make all of that happen of course, but if you're only ever going to read one book on how tell a story that people will care about, read this one. The four presentation Storylines (Presentation Underlying Message Architectures, or PUMAs) are worth the price of admission alone.

This book identifies six types of "simple rules" that offer enough guidance to be useful but enough flexibility to respond to complexity. More exciting than that, it walks through how to create your own simple rules for work and life. Unless you're my kind of geek, it's not the sexiest topic in the world, but for one thing, it's shockingly useful, and for another, the authors use a conversational tone that makes for pleasant reading. Whether you're looking to make better decisions about investing, dating, or your company's strategy, this book has you covered.

<b>By Steven Johnson</b>

<p>
I worry a bit that this is becoming the Steven Johnson fan club, but I am really enjoying his books recently. This one takes a look at history through the lens of what was made possible through the development of some key technologies, like glass and sanitation. Besides providing a plethora of fun trivia, like the fact that in the mid nineteenth century it was more practical to raise the entire city 10 feet than to tunnel under it to install a sewer system, or that chlorinating water reduced infant mortality by ~40%, the book provides a fascinating reframe of how we normally process history. Instead of looking at decisions made by individuals or trends embodied in governments and cultures, it asks "what couldn't have happened without this technology that did happen after it was invented?" Maybe not as immediately useful as Where Good Ideas Come From, but it's possibly a more approachable and enjoyable introduction to Johnson's style. Definitely check it out.

<b>By Carl Gustav Jung, translated by H.F.C. Hull</b>
</p>

<p>
If you're like me, you probably have a vague idea of Jung from high school English classes, and something about archetypes. Maybe you heard he was an important influence on Lucas when he made Star Wars. If you studied psychology, you may have gotten a brief discussion about how he was important psychologist for a while, but we've moved past his outdated theories. Well, I'm here to tell you that Jung is both weirder and smarter than you probably think, and that makes it worth reading his stuff for yourself. Synchronicity is a perfect introduction because it is short and enjoyably mind-bending. Jung basically argues that disparate events can be meaningfully linked in ways besides causality. If nothing else, it is an enjoyable mental exercise to wrestle with such an alien concept, and who knows, you might gain a richer understanding of your own experience of the world.

I just couldn't resist a book about where the voice in your head comes from when today's post is about imagining other people's voices. I have no idea at how well regarded this book is currently as a credible explanation of where consciousness came from, but it makes a fantastic tool for imagining <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4893">what if the world really were that way? What would it mean?</a> The book argues that "consciousness" - an almost unending voice in your head that narrates your thoughts and what's going on and is perceived as "yourself" is actually a rather recent phenomenon. Jaynes says that the Old Testament documents a culture going through the transition, and that you see similar evidence in Mesopotamian history as well. There's nothing immediately practical here, but it's enjoyably mind-blowing. Plus, season one of Westworld will make a lot more sense, so there's also that.

On first read through, this book comes off as a bit esoteric and hard to apply, but that is because it provides principles important enough to span multiple disciplines, and you will have to figure out how to apply them to your areas of concern. When you do, though, the payoff is pretty great. Read this book if you are especially interested in deeply mastering a field or if you want to improve your ability both to "turn it on" and "turn it off".

I have wanted to talk about this book in this series so many times, but all I've been able to swing is a mention here and there. It is a fascinating and entertaining look at the commonalities between innovators in fields as diverse as biology, literature, and air conditioning invention. From a practical standpoint, it gives guidance on how to cultivate those commonalities in your life - such as living and interacting with "liquid networks", taking notes in a way that lets you develop "slow hunches", and allowing "fuzzy connection making". Read this book if you want structure your life in a way that maximizes your potential to innovate.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-zero-to-one">
<p>
Though it focuses on building a start up, the core thesis of this book is that start ups are near perfect vehicles for world-changing innovation, but to make that happen, you have to think about the world in certain ways. The most provocative way this book recommends is to seek out "secrets" - things that you know or suspect and the rest of the world either doesn't know or thinks is ridiculous - and then use those secrets to build a monopoly in a field.  To find such secrets, Thiel suggests that you ask yourself "what are things that I believe that everyone else thinks are ridiculous?" Read this book if you are trying to figure out why creativity matters or how you can change the world with it.

In addition to specific prompts it also provides some advice on how to make sure you're still stretching yourself with your practice and what to do when you want to start moving from having a lot of ideas to having good ideas with techniques like "idea sex" and "10 things I learned from <span class="underline"><span class="underline">_</span></span>".

A classic in the creativity field for a reason, in addition to a wonderful definition of what lateral thinking is and how it complements linear reasoning, it contains dozens of exercises designed for teachers to use with their students.

This delightfully irreverent book focuses on using playfulness and the unexpected to generate novel solutions. My favorite suggestion from the book is its recommendation to use "oracles" - something that provides arbitrary responses which you have to apply to your current situation. Read this book if you are looking for ways to get unstuck in your divergence process or if you want to inject some fun into your creative process.

I first read this book years ago in college, and I absolutely love it. The author's stated intent is to help you be more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat">mentat</a>, which is just fine with me. It covers a diversity of topics from improving memory to mental clarity to, yes, creativity. This book served as my exposure to topics that would later become deeply important to me like meditation, breathing exercises, and the link between physical and mental fitness. Published by <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> it has the easy referenceability of a well-executed technical manual. I also discovered while working on this post that the author has a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mindhacker-Tips-Tricks-Games-Level-ebook/dp/B005LGUMKQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505445702&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mind+performance+hacks">new book</a> out on similar topics that I am eager to check out.

Okay, last Operating Manual, I promise. This book has so much high quality stuff, but most of what will be directly relevant to creativity will be in the Wealthy and Wise sections. Robert Rodriguez's chapter in particular was an unexpected gem on the subject. Josh Waitzkin's chapter also presents a lot of what is in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505443400&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning">The Art of Learning</a> in a compressed way if you want to get a taste. "Testing the 'Impossible': 17 Questions that Changed My Life" is available as a <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/">podcast</a> and presents a useful set of lenses by which to re-assess a situation, which can lead to some great creative insights. Read this book if you want a relentless focus on practical advice that incorporates creativity into a wider goal of achievement and fulfillment.

There are lots of great TED talks out there, and big surprise, several of them are about creativity. This <a href="http://motto.time.com/4256296/ted-talks-creativity/">article</a> breaks down some of the best. I can vouch for Eilzabeth Gilbert's <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius">talk</a>. She talks about how useful it is for writers (and other creatives) to view inspiration as an external force coming from a muse outside of their control - because it removes the pressure of trying to be great. Instead, you just have to show up and do the work, and when the muse wants to visit, she does. It does a lot of the same work as War of Art above. Watch this talk if you keep putting off starting that creative pursuit because you're afraid it won't be good enough.

Finally, creativity is all about practice and one of the best investments you can make is in a course. We've covered a chunk of the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity process</a>, but a day long course will be literally life-changing. Unless you practice, you can't really internalize a rigorous step-by-step approach to problem solving, and we all make mistakes when learning. A course solves that problem by including a skilled facilitator who knows where people are most likely to fall back on old habits and how to step in and address them. Also, you'll get to explore your <a href="https://www.basadurprofile.com/default.aspx">problem solving profile</a>, which will blow you away when you start seeing how relevant it is in the workplace. I'm sure there are lots of valuable creativity classes and events to attend, but I can whole heartedly endorse this one from experience, and I hope you get the chance to do so as well.

This one is not explicitly about creativity, but I think you'll find it more helpful in that respect than you might think at first glance. Written by a pair of Navy SEAL officers who served together in Ramadi, Iraq when it was at its worst, this book lays out deceptively simple principles for effective leadership. I say deceptive because simple does not mean easy. Following the straightforward advice is much harder than understanding it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-maximize_the_value_of_your_creative_inputs">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-September-08
</p>

<p>
In the previous posts on creativity, I’ve mentioned “inputs” pretty frequently, but I haven’t gone into much detail about them. Today, I’ll talk about what I mean by inputs, why they’re important, and share some rules for maximizing their usefulness. I’m very excited to be sharing this with you, because I think it’s an often overlooked aspect of creativity that can have huge effects on your work with very little effort.
</p>

<p>
First off, let’s get on the same page about what I mean by inputs. I am using this fairly vague term to mean anything that you read, watch, listen to, view, or otherwise interact with in the hopes that it will contribute directly or indirectly to your creative process. That’s a pretty broad, abstract definition, let’s go for some examples. A novel you read for pleasure is probably an input, but one you read to get in the right frame of mind for writing your own story is definitely one. Music you listen to while you drive to work might be an indirect input, but music you analyze for technical skills you might incorporate into your own performance definitely is. The bill you get in the mail almost definitely is not an input, but hey, it just might inspire you. What these distinctions point to is that “input” is not really a category with discrete edges, but rather a radial based on intent: some things are dead center, others are so far away that they almost definitely won’t function as creative inputs. One of the reasons we have to talk probabilistically rather than deterministically is the role the subconscious plays in creativity: a relevant connection to that story you read three years ago might suddenly pop into your head, even if you were reading it with no particular purpose at the time. As such, while the rules I recommend below will serve you well with any sort of material you engage with, you don’t have to become a total hardass about everything you interact with - apply these more rigorously in areas you are specifically targeting for your creative work (unless you really want to). So without further ado, here’s Jeff’s rules for creative inputs:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5491b26" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5491b26">1- Privilege Long Form over Short</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5491b26">
<p>
As much as possible, pick a book over a blog post, a blog post over a tweet, a tweet over a comment. Seek out longer, more involved renditions of whatever you need, and actively avoid shorter versions where possible. There are a couple of reasons for this - first off, the longer something is, the more likely that the creator <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/28/how-to-build-a-large-audience-from-scratch-and-more/">put some real thought into it</a> and genuinely cared about it. This isn’t an ironclad rule, but it’s a reasonably useful heuristic. This can be hard to swallow in a world obsessed with speed, efficiency, and convenience - but remember, our goal here isn’t to go through as much stuff as possible, it’s to get genuine, long-lasting benefit from high quality stuff. Secondly, even if the longer form content isn’t actually any better than shorter stuff, engaging with it lets you <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">exercise your attention span</a>. As many of us have noticed in the age of the smartphone and constant availability, you can lose your ability to focus on just one thing at a time when every day is full of constant task switching. Fortunately, it works the other way too - you can practice focusing on one thing at a time for extended periods and <a href="https://calnewport.com/neil-gaimans-advice-to-writers-get-bored/">get comfortable with the boredom</a> you will almost certainly feel at some point. So longer stuff gives you a double whammy for improving creativity - higher quality material that simultaneously improves your ability to focus.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org79f13df" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79f13df">2 - Go for Depth over Breadth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79f13df">
<p>
As with the advice in a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#two_creativity_frameworks">previous post</a>, to alternate rest and effort, this one also comes from <a href="https://joshwaitzkin.com">Josh Waitzkin</a>. We are living in a world of nearly infinite information at our fingertips, so you are unlikely to be challenged by a lack of exposure to neat stuff. Rather, you are at a much greater risk of never truly diving deep into something and finding the beautiful insights only available to someone who truly masters it. I’ve got to admit, following my own advice on this rule is incredibly hard - I am a hardcore serial dabbler. Breadth can be fantastic for creating truly novel connections between disparate material, but paradoxically, pursuing depth is required for truly getting the value out of breadth. If you have only a shallow understanding of two topics, you will only know what makes them different, or only perceive the similarities that are so obvious as to be worthless. Only a deep understanding of a topic will allow you to see its principles embodied in unexpected places.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf85a6d1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf85a6d1">3 - Actively Engage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf85a6d1">
<p>
At this point, you may have noticed a distinct lack of the terms "consume” and “content” - this has been entirely intentional. Consumption passively implies the material does all the real work, but creativity requires action. Likewise, content has a certain connotation of things produced to fill space or support some other aim, rather than for its intrinsic beauty or worth. So, I have emphasized interaction and engagement because you have to make material your own before you can use it in your creative process: probe it, question it, internalize it. 
</p>

<p>
The best way I know how to actually do this is by creating some version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>. Ryan Holiday <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">explains</a> the method he learned from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190714230235/http://powerseductionandwar.com/">Robert Greene</a>, which involves index cards in a box. I am strongly tempted to give this method a shot due to my love of all things analog, but thus far I have been seduced by the various conveniences of digital, and so use Evernote. My very favorite feature is the Evernote Web Clipper plugin for my browser. This allows me to easily store blog posts, articles, even entire web pages right alongside quotes, .pdfs, and my own notes. Further, I can sort and tag all of this stuff so that I can identify connections and themes when I review. The other feature that makes Evernote especially conducive to creativity is Context, which points to notes, websites, and other material that might be relevant to what you're currently viewing. Now, Context doesn’t always get it right, but the beauty is that this kind of <a href="https://www.alibris.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-from-The-Natural-History-of-Innovation-Steven-Johnson/book/12949732?matches=171">"fuzzy" connection-making introduces just enough errors to spur you to creative insights</a>, while usually helping you find things that you’re looking for. 
</p>

<p>
Whatever method you choose to use for engaging with your inputs, make sure you do not simply passively read, listen, or view: grab your inputs and shake them until their lunch money falls out.
</p>

<p>
To close, I'll repeat a no-doubt familiar refrain: there is so much more we could cover here, and I look forward to digging into it with you in the future. For now you've got a great set of easy rules you can start applying to the material you use in your creative process. I also want to point out that all of the creativity methods, exercises, and rules we’ve covered so far are multiplicative rather than additive - every one you adopt makes all of the others more effective. Little daily habits add up to life changing results pretty fast. Next time, we'll cover some resources to help you move beyond this base camp and venture into the wilds of creativity.

Ryan Holiday has been behind a lot of what I've talked about here and a lot of the links I've shared, but I haven't called him out explicitly yet. He's a modern day exponent of an ancient philosophy, and though my interest in stoicism predates my exposure to Holiday, I have found his works useful and engaging. He's best known for <i>The Obstacle is the Way</i>, which has been hugely influential with top performers from the business world to the NFL, but I have found this book more useful personally. It is a systematic analysis of how prone we all are to excessive self regard and the ways that destroys you - whether you are aspiring, achieving, or failing. Ego also hinders true creativity because it stops you from the real work you need to push limits and discover new frontiers.

Tim Ferriss and Ramit Sethi like to joke about how much their book titles sound like infomercials, but I have to admit that this book has them beat by a mile - One Minute Workout? That's even crazier than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE">six minute abs</a>. What you find when you actually dig in, though, is a thorough discussion of the science and benefits of High Intensity Interval Training. Even better, it presents a variety of HIIT workouts you can try out for your own health. Bang-for-buck-wise, HIIT is the king of exercises. Even better, training your heart to speed up and slow down regularly has dramatic effects on your brain's ability to do the same - so following the workouts in this book will help you not only be healthier, but more creative to boot. Not a bad deal for one minute (plus another 9 of warm up, cool down, and rest - but I can't blame them for the catchy title).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-two_creativity_frameworks">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-September-01
</p>

<p>
In our last installment in this series, we talked about <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/25/practicing-divergent-convergent-thinking-creativity-part-3">divergent and convergent thinking</a>. Keep that in mind, as it will be central to everything we discuss below. Today, we're going to talk about frameworks you can use to structure your creative efforts - one for teams and one for individuals. You can use either framework in the other situation, but I find them better suited to different applications.
</p>

<p>
When we discussed creativity frameworks <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">previously</a>, I mentioned the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/howwedoit/An8StepProcess/tabid/82/Default.aspx">Basadur Applied Creativity</a> method. It is comprehensive and fantastic, but I'm not going to lay out the whole system (go <a href="http://www.basadur.com/whatwedo/SkillBuildingWorkshops/tabid/75/Default.aspx">sign up</a> for a class!). Instead, I will focus on the 80/20 piece of the framework: Problem Formulation. This piece of the process is valuable precisely because people tend to blow it off if they aren't trained otherwise. In practice, taking the time to formulate the right problem statement makes an enormous difference in the quality of your solutions. One last point before we jump in: I have not attended any of the instructor certification workshops for this method - so take all this as the advice of a fellow practitioner, not as gospel.
</p>

<p>
Okay, with that out of the way, let's jump in. The first step is to take a "fuzzy situation" that your team wants to make better and come up with potential problems related to this fuzzy situation. A fuzzy situation might be something like "we aren't selling enough sprockets." In this and each following step, you will diverge and converge as separate, clear activities. It helps to have a designated facilitator around to shepherd people through the process. So, everyone diverges on potential problems - things like "our sales people are lazy," or "nobody wants sprockets anymore" or "lizard people are secretly sabotaging our sprocket selling efforts" - remember, bad ideas are welcome and even helpful when diverging. Your goal here is to get every possible thing that might be a problem out on the table - that's one reason this method works so well with groups, as it helps to get all the little bits of knowledge in different people's heads out and in the open where everybody can use it.
</p>

<p>
With lots of potential problems to consider, the group looks at them and converges on which ones are most worth developing further. To figure out if you're right, you're going to need facts - so step two is Fact Finding. If you skip this step, down the road you will hit a snag. Again, diverge on what facts might be relevant, and then converge on the ones that really are most useful. I should point out that at this phase, "facts" can include things that you know you need to learn. You can use these awesome fact finding questions to make sure you cover all your bases:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What do we know or think we know?</li>
<li>What don't we know that we would like to?</li>
<li>What have we already thought or tried?</li>
<li>Why is this a problem for us?</li>
<li>What will we get if we solve this problem?</li>
<li>What are we assuming?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The last step in Problem formulation is to arrive at a Problem Definition: a phrase or sentence that clearly states what it is that your team is actually trying to solve. A good problem definition will come in the form of "How might we <span class="underline"><span class="underline">_</span></span>?" As always, diverge on lots of possible problem statements based on the facts, and then converge on the one your team wants to focus on solving right now. If you have lots of potentially valuable problem statements, that's fine - you can always come back to them later, but you want to focus on the most valuable one until you solve it. This probably all seems rather involved just to figure out what the problem is, but after going through this a few times you'll see how valuable it is to take the time to aim at the right target instead of just blasting away at whatever presents itself.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">last time</a>, while the AC approach is amazing for teams, especially in a business setting, I find it a bit involved for individual creative work. For this, I like to follow Young's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503617585&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. The steps are pretty straightforward and his book spells them out well: gather materials, work them over to the point of exhaustion, put them out of your mind, wait for an idea to appear, and then modify the idea based on trusted feedback. I want to highlight two areas: working over the materials and putting them out of your mind.
</p>

<p>
Most folks these days have heard some variation of "<a href="https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/8156/is-there-any-scientific-literature-on-the-shower-principle-i-e-taking-a-bre">the shower principle</a>": the idea that creative insight often appears while doing something totally unrelated to the topic. Many of these people try to help it along by purposely changing activities to something unrelated to their challenge, relying on their subconscious to do the heavy lifting. Putting the work out of your mind is a great strategy, and an essential component for "aha!" insights, but going right to it misses a critical step: getting the material into a form your subconscious can work with. Your subconscious deals in feelings and intents and symbols, and not so much in words and reason. Unless you already deeply care about the topic, it is in a language your subconscious doesn't speak, so you have to translate the material.
</p>

<p>
To do so, you have to work at the material until it seeps deep into your mind - repetition is essential, and if you can find a way to intensify your emotional connection to the material, so much the better. What this looks like in practice is that you do everything your conscious mind can think of with the material - try different approaches, tweak different parts, re-arrange the parts - and keep doing that until it starts to look like mumbo jumbo and you hit a mental brick wall. The tricky part is telling the difference between "I'm a little bored" and "I really have nothing more to do with this" - pushing through that initial boredom is <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/09/05/john-cage-on-the-necessity-of-boredom/">critical</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you aren't sure which you're experiencing, take a short break without any new inputs - go for a walk, get some water, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/09/15/bootcamp-day-1/">that kind of thing</a>. Come back and promise yourself another 15-20 minutes on the matter at hand, even if you're just staring at your work so far.  If you still don't get anywhere, then maybe you're done working it over for now.
</p>

<p>
Only after you've internalized the material by doing everything you can think of with it do you want to put it out of your mind. Sometimes this can be easier said than done. If something is important enough to you for your subconscious to be able to do its thing, chances are that your conscious mind won't want to drop it. Here's a few things to help you out. First off, remind yourself that while it feels like you're "not doing anything," putting it out of your mind is an essential step in doing something about it. This can be hard, especially if you're a take-charge type - hence the conscious reminder. Second, it helps to choose something you find intrinsically enjoyable and emotionally stimulating. Not only is it easier to ignore a problem when you're enjoying something you love, the positive emotional engagement also stimulates the subconscious that you are relying on. Finally, much of your mind's ability to alternate between going hard and relaxing is directly influenced by your body's ability to do the same. Remember the <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/5/26/preventative-maintenance-self-care-part-2">bi-directional nature of stress and physiology</a>? Same deal. Josh Waitzkin talks about this quite a bit in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503618266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning">his book</a> and his <a href="https://tim.blog/tag/josh-waitzkin/">interviews</a> with Tim Ferriss. Strangely, because of this physical element, one of the best creativity exercises is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">High Intensity Interval Training</a>. The <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/One-Minute-Workout-Science-Smarter-Shorter-ebook/dp/B01IOHQ7RA/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">One Minute Workout</a> lays out several options for planning your HIIT workouts. Even if you don't go in for HIIT workouts, other physical considerations are still critical: at least eat well, get enough rest, and stay active somehow.
</p>

<p>
With the the two approaches above, you have some concrete guidance on what to do when you want to "be creative." I've focused on the non-obvious pieces of these two frameworks, but both are worth checking out in full when you have the chance. Next time we'll talk about some habits you can adopt to increase the quality and usefulness of the inputs to your creative process.

</p>

<p>
Okay, so I had planned on covering all of the exercises in one post, but when I broke them out, I realized I would be delivering a gigantic, hard to digest mess. So I broke it up. Our next few posts will cover all of the exercises associated with the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/the_building_blocks_of_creativity">building blocks</a> we covered last time, starting with Divergent and Convergent thinking today. It's a great place to start, because if you develop your ability to separate these two ways of thinking, everything else will flow naturally.
</p>

<p>
For many people, the skill you will most need to improve is your ability to think up ideas - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">active divergence</a>. If you're like me, this seems like a mysterious ability some people are born with, and is totally opaque. Fortunately, whether or not some folks are more naturally inclined to be good at it, you can practice and improve. My favorite practice for this comes from <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a>. Here it is: write 10 ideas on a prompt, once a day every day. That's it. I first encountered it in his book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-Guide-Wealth-ebook/dp/B00U7IS4S0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503612736&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=choose+yourself+guide+to+wealth">The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth</a>, which is one of my <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life">mental operating manuals</a>, but you can also find it explained in this blog <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/">post on how to be "lucky"</a>. The lists don't even have to be on anything important - silly stuff works just as well for practicing. You aren't shooting for good ideas, you just come up with a lot of ideas. This is pure active divergence practice. As you do this regularly enough, you will start finding it much easier to think things up on the spot in any situation, which comes in pretty darn handy.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you're jamming on the above practice and you screech to a halt, unable to think of any more ideas. Here's a few techniques you can use to get the juices flowing again. The first is "unclumping" - look at one of the ideas you've already written and ask yourself what every possible variation of that thing might be. Say your prompt was "things that are round," and one of your ideas was "balls." You could unclump that by writing baseballs, basketballs, bocce balls, et cetera. If you are wired like I am, this may feel like you are "cheating," but actually you are stimulating exactly the muscle we want to exercise here. The next technique is to apply your five senses to the subject you are trying to generate ideas on. Maybe you're locked into things that stimulate sight, or feel, and are ignoring others. In the case of things that are round, "smell" might make you think of an orange, or "taste" might prompt you to think of a scoop of ice cream - and then you can go off in a whole new direction. Finally, there's a specific list of modifications you can apply in a handy acronym: T.R.A.N.S.F.O.R.M. - Twist/Turn, Rotate, Add, Novelize, Subtract, Fuse, Omit, Reverse, Minify/Magnify. I tend to default to unclumping when I feel stuck, but all three can really help you expand the number of ideas you generate.
</p>

<p>
We've covered how to generate more ideas, but some people find that relatively easy and instead are challenged by what to do with them once you have them. These people need more practice with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">active convergence</a>. Personally, I find this far easier and more intuitive than cranking ideas out, so I've had to engage in some reflection and discussion with people who think differently from me to figure out what to recommend here. There are two main ways you can come at evaluating the ideas you have previously generated: bottom up or top down. Bottom up approaches focus on evaluating ideas based on their similarity to each other, whereas top down focus on rating ideas with respect to how they fit pre-defined criteria.
</p>

<p>
My personal favorite convergence activity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram">affinity mapping</a>. This is a bottom up approach used to organically figure out groupings and categories. To give it a try, first actively diverge as above, but put each idea on its own sticky note. Then, find a big stretch of wall or whiteboard and start putting the ideas up there . As you add ideas, look at the existing ones and ask yourself "do these go together?" If so, place them close to each other. Don't worry too much about explicitly defining the criteria that makes them go together just yet. As you go through, you'll find that some of your clumps maybe should be split up, and others should be merged - that's okay, the point of the exercise is to discover these relationships.
</p>

<p>
An example top down approach is a model called a <a href="http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/pugh-matrix.html">Pugh Matrix</a> - a name I only recently learned from an engineer friend for something I've been doing for years. To do this, put each idea on a line in a spreadsheet. Then, label each column with the different criteria you are using. Then go through the matrix you just created and rate each criteria on the same scale (1-5 is a common one, but you can also go for binary or just use whatever makes sense). When you finish, you'll have a score both for each individual criterion but also an aggregate. If you want to get real fancy, you can apply different weights to different criteria. You can then perform all sorts of manipulations on the data so created (averages, spreads, et cetera). Just be careful to remind yourself that this is still a qualitative and subjective tool, despite its appearance of being a quantitative and objective tool thanks to all those numbers - just remind yourself you made them all up, you didn't measure them somewhere.
</p>

<p>
By way of an example, my wife and I applied this system when we bought a house. Before we started looking, we came up with a list of features that mattered to us. Once we had identified two houses we liked, we compared them by rating each characteristic. By going through piece by piece and seeing how both houses stacked up, it made it very clear which one we actually favored. So we put in an offer and ended up in a place we love, with the peace of mind that we thought out our decisions thoroughly.  
</p>

<p>
The above exercises are merely examples of the deeper principles of divergent and convergent thinking, but extremely useful and illuminating examples. Idea generation especially is a habit you can incorporate into your daily life and start noticing its application in diverse situations. Join us next time as we discuss how to apply and practice the two problem solving frameworks we introduced previously.

<b>By Edward de Bono</b>
</p>

<p>
I mentioned this book in the previous posts on creativity, but it didn't get its own spotlight yet. It's a classic in the realm of creativity, and a lot of what has been developed since builds on its solid foundation. It takes an extremely practical approach by recommending various exercises a teacher might assign students to encourage and develop lateral thinking, but these are just as easily self-imposed by those of us lacking adult supervision. My very favorite takeaway from this book is the idea that sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea first.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the_building_blocks_of_creativity">
<p>
<b>Date</b>: 2017-August-18
</p>

<p>
Last time we came up with a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/defining_creativity">definition of creativity</a>, and today we're going to talk about some of its core building blocks, from deferring judgment to the inputs you take in. These fundamental concepts will give you the raw materials you need to understand and undertake specific exercises to be more creative yourself - some of which we'll detail in our next installment of the series.
</p>

<p>
The first and most important concept you need for better creativity comes from Edward De Bono's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Step-ebook/dp/B003V1WTLI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502986629&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lateral+thinking">Lateral Thinking</a>: sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea. Everything else we'll talk about grows from this small seed. You can grasp this simple idea in moments, but like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Othello</a>, you can spend a lifetime truly mastering it. For your first challenge, the entire tradition of western thought has focused on <a href="http://www.andyeklund.com/is-linear-thinking-bad/">Linear Thinking</a>, which de Bono contrasts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">Lateral Thinking</a> in his book of the same name. Our education and culture reinforce linear thinking relentlessly. It requires every step make sense and build to the next. It's how you make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument#Deductive">an argument that doesn't suck</a>. It's how you prove things in math or map out a promising theory in science. If one step is wrong, every step after it is wrong, end of story. So when you operate in a linear thinking mode, you carefully check every step of progress to make sure you're still on firm ground.
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong: linear thinking is extremely important, despite being less sexy than lateral thinking. At some point, you have to figure out if your brilliant idea actually works. The trouble is that linear thinking can hamper you from having the good idea in the first place. Sometimes something silly or wrong gets you to look at a problem in a new way, which produces genuine insight. You give yourself permission to have bad ideas that can get to good ideas later with a habit of thought called <a href="https://blog.basadur.com/2015/02/04/does-deferring-judgment-really-impact-creativity-or-does-immediate-judgement-save-a-lot-of-time-and-provide-the-hard-nosed-focus-that-real-world-innovation-demands/">Active Deferral of Judgement</a>.  Simply catch yourself whenever you go "that was silly" or "that will never work" while you are trying to think up ideas. We'll talk more in the next part of the series about techniques to build this habit.
</p>

<p>
Deferring judgment lets us properly separate thinking into its two flavors: <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">divergent</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">and</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">convergent</a>. Divergent thinking is maximizing the number of ideas on the table - it is often referred to as ideation or idea generation. Convergent thinking is looking at previously created ideas and deciding which ones are relevant - it is often called evaluation. Both kinds of thinking are equally important and equally necessary - remember that my definition of creativity requires things be both new and useful.
</p>

<p>
Turns out most of us find it easier to do one or the other, and if we don't learn about these differences, we get puzzled by other people's challenges. For example, I have a friend who can fill a page with brand new ideas while I'm still struggling to break 10. On the other hand, ask him to take 100 things and group them based on similarity and he'll be agonizing while I'm happily clustering sticky notes. The important thing is <a href="https://melanism.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cropped-header2013.jpg">don't cross the streams</a>. Unlike chocolate and peanut butter, these two flavors are not better together. Prematurely converging hinders your ability to produce ideas, and coming up with ideas distracts you from evaluating what you already have. Again, we'll go into some tools next time for how to successfully separate these.
</p>

<p>
Even though I'm sure you will start applying the above concepts all over the place already, there's another step for maximum effectiveness. If you point a group of people at a problem and say "Diverge then converge and come back to me with something great!" they're probably going to spend a lot of time spinning their wheels. To get around that, you need a process or framework that gives guidance on what to diverge on, and what criteria to use for convergence.
</p>

<p>
One of the best frameworks for teams is <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity</a>. It consists of an eight part problem solving cycle with divergence and convergence in each phase. It's remarkably effective for surfacing the best stuff from a group and generating creative solutions to problems with buy in from everyone on the team. I use it at work all the time, and I'm consistently amazed by what we we get when we use the process versus when we don't.
</p>

<p>
For individual creative pursuit, though, I find the Basadur approach a bit heavyweight. Instead, I prefer the framework laid out in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502990296&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">A Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. It is straightforward, actionable, and consistently produces individual insights when followed. Plus, you want to talk about bang for buck? This 42 page book will revolutionize how you work on your own creative projects. We'll talk through how to apply both of these frameworks next time.
</p>

<p>
We often overlook the last concept I want to talk about when we are thinking of creativity as an active pursuit: our <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/creative-output-requires-quality-inputs/#gs.WY=bvIM">inputs</a>. If you want to think well, you need things to think about, and those come from what you read, watch, hear, and do. Remember that our definition from last time emphasized the role of finding new connections between existing material in creativity. Your inputs determine both the existing material and the ideas for new connections you have to work with. We live in an age of near unlimited informational options, so next time I'll discuss some of the ways I like to make decisions about what inputs to seek out and experience.
</p>

<p>
As we talked about, creativity is a much discussed topic, so I've left out a number of interesting ideas and focused on the most essential. You could do worse than to check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">Wikipedia article</a> on creativity if you want to check out some stuff not covered here. I found the discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Affect">Affect</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#REM_sleep">Sleep</a> especially thought provoking. I was also fascinated by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502991782&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=where+good+ideas+come+from">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>, but it looks more at cultural and strategic ways to foster creativity - how does a society end up creative or what can someone do over the course of their life to cultivate creative insights, rather than "what can I do when I sit down with a specific problem today?" There's a lot of high quality thinking out there on creativity, and I look forward to revisiting the topic for a long time to come.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so I've laid out why Active Deferral of Judgement, Divergence/Convergence, Framework, and Inputs are the basic components of creativity. Next time we'll go through examples of how to actually apply each of these concepts, but even without that, you now how a powerful toolbox for thinking about and working with creativity.

<p>
This book might be the best "bang for the buck" I've ever seen - at 42 pages, you can easily read it in an evening and almost every single page is chock full of useful, actionable tips. It lays out the steps to follow in order to generate new, creative ideas. While it lacks some of the concepts we go through in our creativity series, it easily integrates with them. Do yourself a favor and check this out.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-defining_creativity">

</p>

<p>
When I sat down to write a post about innovation, I quickly realized we had an unwieldy topic on our hands. So, instead of a single post on innovation and the future, I've decided to kick off a short series on creativity. To begin with, I'll provide my favorite definition of creativity and step through each piece of it and what it implies for applications down the road.
</p>

<p>
Just about anyone you talk to wants to be "more creative,"  but what does that really mean? There are <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/define-creativity/">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.basadur.com/insightsresearch/OurThoughtsonCreativityandInnovation/tabid/80/Default.aspx">different</a> ways to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creativity">define</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creativity</a>, and some of them are maddeningly vague or fluffy. Often, we associate creativity only with "artsy" pursuits like painting or poetry and assume that it doesn't apply to more hard-nosed disciplines. I think that nothing could be farther from the truth. So I've cobbled together various definitions in a way that is equally useful whether you are creating art or building a business: the ability to make useful new connections between concepts.
</p>

<p>
Let's start unpacking that definition, beginning with the core: making connections. We like to idealize creativity as conjuring something out of nothing, but really, to have new ideas, you have to have raw material. That's one reason why creativity requires voraciously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2pre2xnA1M">reading, watching, and listening to interesting and diverse material</a>. No one argues that being creative is just knowing about a bunch of different stuff, though. You gotta connect that stuff. That's one reason games, randomizers, and "oracles" can be so <a href="http://blog.creativethink.com/2007/01/use_a_random_id.html">useful for spurring creativity</a> - they force connections where none existed previously.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so if creativity is about making connections, the thing that makes those connections "creative" is that they are new. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">first time</a> someone noticed that cats and people and elephants have something in common with each other that they don't with snakes and lizards, that was creative. Noticing it today is not. We are all standing on the shoulders of everyone who has come before us, extending the network of associations further and further into conceptual space.  At first this can seem a bit intimidating, like everything really worthwhile has already been figured out. Here's the thing, though: because this network of connections that has been made, we have exponentially more raw material to work with than anyone else in the history of humanity. That's pretty awesome if you ask me. We're going to dive more into how lucky we really are when we talk about practical ways to be more creative in our own lives.
</p>

<p>
Finally, our new connections must also be useful. As we'll discuss later when we talk about specific techniques, it can actually hinder your ability to come up with stuff if start out too focused on "what's useful." That's just a phase in the process though, and the difference between <a href="http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/">brilliant and silly</a> is how much value people get out of the connection you have made for them. As we'll see when we dive into more "how to" later in the series, one of the most challenging things to do can be to allow ourselves to be silly at one phase while ruthlessly <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html">killing our darlings</a> later on.
</p>

<p>
We've stepped through why creativity is about connections, how those connections have to be new, and why they need to be useful to qualify as "creative". With this definition in mind, our future posts will get to the good stuff: practical advice to get you on the path to more creativity in your life and work.

<b>By Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</b>

<p>
If you spend as much time as I do listening to podcasts by Silicon Valley types, you've been hearing about this book for ages. I've been putting off reading it because I figured "well, I'm not starting a tech company, so it doesn't apply to me." Turns out that was a silly and limited way to think about the book. I ended up valuing it more for its discussion of the secrets that are the root of real economic value and its concepts of definite versus indefinite optimism. It was also the inspiration for the current series, as it talked about the importance of creativity and implementation in building the future world. It's a pretty quick read and well worth it.

<p>
<b>By Zhuang Zi, trans. Burton Watson</b>
</p>

<p>
This is an excerpt of the complete Zhuangzi, and I'm normally a rabid completionist, but there are three facts that lead me to recommend this edition: 1. This is the version I had in my physical library and therefore read, 2. The translator makes a pretty good case that what is excluded is mostly later (less awesome) additions to the work of the original author, and 3. you can get this excerpt for about one third of the price of the complete works. So, with that in mind, let me tell you what's great about this book. It's a lot more lively than most philosophy, featuring poetry, metaphor, and humor. I found it almost as valuable as a demonstration of an alternative way to convey deep, important ideas as I did for the actual ideas it was discussing. It's also interestingly different from the Daoism you may know from the <i>Daodejing</i>. I'm not going to get a Yin-Yang symbol tattooed on me anytime soon, but I have found this a worthwhile addition to my mental tool kit.

<i><p>A Note on Spelling Conventions - Skip if you are not a language nerd:</p>

<p>Since westerners started studying Chinese, they have tried to get around the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to render it. For years the most popular way was the “Wade-Giles System,” which uses various letter combinations as kludges to represent tones. It is a clever way to operate within the constraints of existing letters, but if you don’t know the code, you’re gonna say everything wrong.</p>

<p>More recently, the People’s Republic of China has introduced the pinyin system. The key feature of which is the use of diacritic marks to indicate tones, which is incredibly useful for ignorant westerners like me. With this, you can be much more straightforward in your use of letters, so even if you get the tones wrong, you’re at least getting the rest right. Because of this, I have decided to ditch the Wade-Giles spellings familiar from my youth and use pinyin without the diacritics (because they are a pain in the ass on an English keyboard).</p></i>

<p>
I decided to take advantage of my vacation in China to read some Chinese philosophy in the land that gave it birth. Looking over my bookshelf, I noticed a book I had purchased for a college class - Zhuangzi. In the class we only read a tiny excerpt, and ever since it’s been on my “meaning to read” list. So I ended up pulling it out of my bag and digging in while floating through a landscape that looks exactly like a Chinese landscape painting. 
</p>

<p>
First off, let’s provide a bit of context. “Zhuangzi” can refer to both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou">philosopher</a> (“Master Zhuang”) or to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">work ascribed to him</a> (but probably containing material added later by other people as well). Besides the semi-mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Laozi</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Daodejing</a>, Zhuangzi is the next most foundational work in Daoism. The philosopher was a rough contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a>’s in the 4th century BCE. Both of these eminent gentlemen helped to define the explosion of thinking known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought">“The Hundred Schools of Thought”</a>. In terms of influence on later philosophy, this time period is roughly analogous to the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy">Hellenisitic age</a> in the west  - a flowering of different approaches that are still discussed, debated, and even followed today. This author of Zhuangzi used this context by telling stories featuring members of other schools of thought - sometimes showing them as fellow seekers of wisdom and other times mercilessly parodying them and their hang ups. 
</p>

<p>
One of the things that struck me in the book was the similarity of the core of the philosophy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Zhuangzi essentially argues that the world is constantly changing and the only way to not be perturbed by this is align yourself with that change, which is an expression of the universal Way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Dao</a>). Despite some important differences, the core idea that we can’t control circumstances, but we can control how we react to them, will sound familiar to students of the two schools I mentioned. I will have to reread the <i>Daodejing</i>, but I don’t remember such a clear parallel there. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that such a useful and life-changing mental hack was independently discovered in multiple places. 
</p>

<p>
Which is by no means to say that <i>Zhuangzi</i> is simply a rehash of things you can find elsewhere. It is widely renowned for its imagery, poetry, and imaginative use of metaphor. Some of these struck me as simply bizarre, but many were rather beautiful. One of these poetic sections has become more famous in the west than the book that spawned it: Zhuangzi is the sage who dreamed he was a butterfly and then wondered if he were not a butterfly dreaming of being a man. Besides the imagery, the other ingredient in Zhuangzi’s secret sauce is humor, and there were several times where I would slowly smile or even chuckle as I realized something that I thought was “serious business” was actually the set up for an elaborate joke. When you put these two stylistic traits together, you get a very interesting effect: since you never know exactly where the author stands moment to moment, or even necessarily what he actually means, you have to think for yourself. You can neither buy everything he says uncritically nor dismiss him as someone you disagree with unconditionally. It’s a remarkably effective way to convey something experientially instead of didactically.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate this dynamic produced by humor, metaphor, and active engagement, let me share my favorite example. Zhuangzi frequently praises the “useless” and denigrates the “useful.” One image he uses is a <a href="http://mjglass.ca/metaphor/uselesstree.htm">gigantic tree</a> that has only been allowed to get so big because no part of it has any usefulness to humans - which would have gotten it cut down or plucked or such like. He similarly points out that useful people get put to work and sometimes even get killed doing that work, and so argues it’s good to be crippled and deformed. I was finding it hard to swallow the whole “useless is good, useful is bad” line of reasoning until one <a href="https://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu3.html#26">striking metaphor</a> got me:
</p>

<p>
"A man has to understand the useless before you can talk to him about the useful. The earth is certainly vast and broad, though a man uses no more of it than the area he puts his feet on. If, however, you were to dig away all the earth from around his feet until you reached the Yellow Springs, then would the man still be able to make use of it?"
</p>

<p>
I had a koan-like flash of insight reading this about all of the other images I had been reading. If not for that moment, I might have written the whole work off as anti-rational nonsense. For you, the “click” might come somewhere else because of a different interaction of the imagery, humor, and your own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Though I still find the <i>Daodejing</i> more relevant, Zhuangzi’s skepticism and anti-authoriatarianism was a welcome breath of fresh air in the sometimes puzzling field of Daoism, and gave me a wider understanding of the philosophy than I previously had. It also opened my mind to alternative ways to convey philosophical truths. If you have made previous forays into Chinese philosophy and found them dull or staid, perhaps you should give <i>Zhuangzi</i> a try.

<b>By Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland</b>
</p>

<p>
Neal Stephenson is probably my favorite living author, and so I buy anything with his name on it no questions asked. I tore through this on my recent flight to Beijing and rather enjoyed it. A shadowy government organization discovers that magic used to be real but doesn't work anymore, and then figures out a way to make it work again to send people back in time. A fun read that touches on all of the exciting possibilities of magic, time travel, and quantum physics. Not as many detailed asides as a pure Stephenson book, but that means that it keeps moving at a brisk pace the whole time. Give it a shot if the idea of mashing up fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction gets you all hot and bothered.

This one didn't quite make it on to my <a href="#my_operating_manuals_for_life">list of operating manuals</a>, in part because I just finished it a week or two ago and I'm not sure how much of an impact it's had on me yet. It might sound hopelessly like positive thinking hippy dippy crap, but I've been getting more and more convinced about the power of auto-suggestion, in part because of the Scott Adams <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/persuasion-reading-list-updated-1-18/">persuasion reading list</a> I've mentioned before. So I'm giving the approaches recommended in this book a good, honest try before I either dismiss it or sing its praises. If you do the same, let me know how it works out for you.

<i>Update 2022-August-25: I no longer give as central a place to many of these books as I did when I wrote this five(!) years ago. For example, I'm not a big fan of James Altucher anymore, as my further exposure to him has made him seem scammy and dishonest. So while there's nothing in the</i> Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth <i>that seems obviously bad or wrong, I don't trust it as a whole anymore. Some other books, like</i> The Poetic Edda <i>have become far more central to my life and understanding of the world.

<p>
The most recent edition to my collection, a month or two back my friend was like “you need to read this right now,” and he was right. James Altucher argues three main points in the book: secure corporate employment for your entire life is dead and gone, it’s up to you to bring value to the world, and the best way to do that is to follow a daily practice that nourishes and improves yourself mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. He supplements all of this with a number of specific techniques on freelancing, selling, networking, and so forth. Some of the books on this list had already laid the groundwork for believing that financial success comes from no other source than me, but this book gave me the tactical kick in the butt I needed to start acting.

<p>
Equal parts manifesto and field guide, Cal Newport argues that focusing on one thing at a time and choosing important, hard work is a super power in a world of constant distraction. My own experience bears this out - when I most seriously follow the approach explained in this book, not only do I get more work done, I feel more fulfilled and happier about it to boot. This book is essential reading if you want to achieve mastery in anything or even just stand out from your peers at work.

<b>By Joshua Waitzkin</b>
</p>

<p>
One of the more challenging books on this list. I have revisited it multiple times, and every time I find a new insight I didn’t pick up before. Waitzkin has thought deeply and internalized several principles on learning and performance at the highest levels through his experience as a child chess master, world champion Tai Chi Push Hands competitor, top tier Brazilian Jiu Jitsu trainer, and a coach for the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. At times bordering on the mystical and opaque, you have to do your own share of the work with this book. Rather than concrete, actionable strategies, this book deals in fundamental principles that are relevant no matter the strategy you choose: which can be frustrating at times, but is more rewarding and useful in the long run.

Another book that doesn’t present easy, pre-digested material. We’ve talked about it somewhat extensively before. While there are a few specific how to’s scattered throughout, such as approaches to diet and exercise, it is far more useful as a foundational text on how to think about uncertainty. It’s another book where I find something new and get smarter every time I revisit it.

The only novel on this list, but don’t let that fool you - it’s still loaded to the gills with insight and useful introspective tools. This book was one of the first to seriously shake my arrogant belief that I understood myself deeply or even what “self” means. I agree with more of it every time I come back to it, and it has also been my personal bridge between stoicism and eastern philosophy - a more compatible pairing than you might think.

The shortest book here, it punches way over its weight. I first read it cover to cover on an hour long flight and it lit my mind on fire. If you have anything remotely creative inside you trying to get out, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It is uncomfortable and galvanizing at the same time - like a cold shower, you will flinch from it at first, but emerge ready to take on the world.

A quick note on translations: these last two books were obviously not written in English, and the translation you select will have a big impact on what you think of it - generally stay away from
the free Kindle editions, as these tend to be old, public domain translations of mediocre quality. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of why I chose these translations, shoot me an email and we can geek out.
</p>

<p>
My personal favorite work of stoic philosophy, it barely edged out Marcus Aurelius for my token Stoic book. Stoicism is such a central part of my personal philosophy that I could have easily chosen nothing but stoic books. Here’s a good overview of stoicism generally, but at the core of it are three men, each impressive in his own way: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.  While I appreciate all of them, turns out I’m a Seneca guy. It is shocking how modern and relevant his 2,000 year old letters feel. Writing to a young friend and protege, Seneca’s advice has the wisdom and clarity of an older mentor who has been there, wishes he had done better, and now advises his young friend to learn from his experience. Friendly, worldly, but with an unceasing dedication to living a good life, these letters are good for you.

Based on the rest of the list, this may come as something of a surprise entry, but I find the myths in it both beautiful and meaningful. The Germanic myths lack the neat and tidy systemization imposed on Greek myth, leaving them with a raw vitality and tantalizingly missing pieces. With all my focus on rational stoicism and conscious improvement, I find it useful to remember the murkier subconscious parts of my mind that can only be accessed through stories of gods, monsters, and magic. Plus they’re viking myths so they’re super metal. If you’re still not convinced and insist on directly useful, you’ll find fewer collections of wisdom poetry more straightforward than the Havamal.

I know that there’s quite a lot to read here, but these are special and well worth the time. I encourage you to pick just one new book and give it a go today. It just might change your life.

I started reading this book because I've encountered the idea of managing "energy" in several places, and I wanted an adequate description to work with. This book did not disappoint. As I read, I kept thinking "this reminds me of Josh Waitzkin's advice in The Art of Learning", so I went back and checked, and sure enough, he trained with the authors. While the physical and emotional energy stuff is useful, I found this work's definition of  "spiritual" as "caring about something larger than yourself beyond your own self-interest" to be the most straightforward and practical definition I've encountered. A lot of ideas from this book have been incorporated elsewhere, but it's full of specific case studies and examples of how the concepts have been applied in a variety of situations. Great stuff.

I've been wanting to read this book ever since listening to James Altucher's <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/podcast/steven-johnson/">interview with the author</a> and it did not disappoint. Wide ranging and diverse in the best possible way, this book draws on examples as diverse as the building of coral reefs and the founding of YouTube to elucidate the components of systems that most reliably produce useful innovation - whether in nature, science, or business. I would have liked just a hair more advice on how to operationalize the concepts, but as a foundation for thinking about hard problems that matter, this book was invaluable.

This book came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine at work and it certainly did not disappoint. It focuses on questions of how objects in our environment can enhance (or detract) from our experience and our lives. Most useful to me was the distinction between <i>affordances</i> and <i>signifiers</i> and the notion of "knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world." If you're even a little bit interested in how the objects, structures, and organizations around you shape your life in subtle ways, you'll thoroughly enjoy this.

I'm not gonna lie to you, friends: I was pretty skeptical of this system when I first heard about it at work. One of my business school professors engrained a deep distrust of "personality types" in general by pointing out that almost all of them except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">The Big Five</a> lack any rigorous empirical testing. That being said, as I read this book, time and again I saw descriptions that rang extremely true for either myself or my loved ones. It's probably easy to take this too far and use it as some kind of universal theory, but it makes an awfully useful heuristic for understanding why you act the way you do, and more importantly, why other people act in such seemingly incomprehensible ways.

<p>
<a href="#rethinking_risk_with_antifragile">Last time</a>, we discussed a new way of looking at the concept of “risk” and our inability to scientifically define it. Today, we go a little deeper and break systems into three categories based on their exposure to volatility: fragile, robust, and antifragile.
</p>

<p>
First we need to realize that volatility, time, and risk are really the same thing. This sounds bizarre, right? But let’s return to our <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rationality.pdf">least-worst definition of risk</a>: “exposure to negative outcomes brought about by volatility." With this in mind, we can see that given enough time, every possible extreme of volatility will be experienced. To return to our coffee mug example, if you leave that mug on a table in San Francisco, eventually an earthquake will knock it off and break it. So, the combination of its exposure to negative outcomes (falls make it break) plus time (eventually something will happen to knock it off) means that more time equals more likely that it is broken. I should point out, of course, that this concept is statistical and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical">empirical</a> in nature, which has three important implications: 1. it is only really valid probabilistically, 2. it can’t predict the outcome for any one single thing, and 3. it makes no theory-based claims as to why time will eventually break most coffee mugs. 
</p>

<p>
We now know that exposure is the most practical thing to care about, since it definitely matters and we can actually observe it. Contrast this with the other elements of “risk” usually considered - the timing or intensity of the outcomes concerned, which we can’t every really know ahead of time. WIth our focus squarely on exposure, we can now look at how to categorize systems based on exposure, and It turns out that there are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile. The first two will be familiar and intuitively obvious, but this last category is novel and thus gives Taleb’s book its name. Let’s go through what each category means and give some examples.
</p>

<p>
Fragile things are hurt by volatility - eventually something goes wrong and they break. The easy example we’ve been using is the coffee mug. An important concept that we’ve skipped over so far is that these categories are defined by their relationship with volatility, which can be changed by circumstances - it’s not an intrinsic quality, even though some things more inherently tend towards fragility than others. 
</p>

<p>
To understand this distinction, I like to think about <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy">potential energy</a>. A brick sitting on top of a ladder has more potential energy than one sitting on the ground. Nothing about the brick changes except its relationship with the gravity well it’s sitting in. Likewise, with our coffee mug, if you wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuffed it in a box, put that box in a waterproof bag, then put that inside a nuke proof bunker filled with packing peanuts, it would be significantly less fragile than sitting on your coffee table, which is less fragile still than balancing on top of a stack of books as you try to open a door.
</p>

<p>
The most relevant real world examples are traditional stocks and artificial systems that are overly optimized. Sure, traditional stocks go up when volatility goes in their favor, but they go down when it goes down, and you need <a href="http://www.360financialliteracy.org/Topics/Budgeting-Spending/Budgeting-and-Saving/Understanding-the-Math-of-Recovering-from-Losses">bigger growth to offset your loss</a>. Highly optimized systems, on the other hand, work great until they catastrophically don’t. These failures are usually due to an unforeseen change in environmental circumstance or an excess of predicted capacity. Traffic is a great example. Highways don’t get linearly slower as cars are added during rush hour - they go from zooming to standstill exponentially quickly as their capacity is exceeded. If you like guns, think about the (somewhat exaggerated) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16">difference between an M16 and an AK-47</a>: an M16 is more accurate and generally higher functioning, but stops working after much less abuse than the less optimized, cruder AK.
</p>

<p>
So, the AK-47 can be described as “more robust” or “less fragile” than the M16. Robust is usually considered the opposite of fragile, but that’s not quite accurate. Robust things are indifferent to volatility - shit happens and they abide. Volatility neither particularly hurts nor particularly helps them. Think of <a href="http://s1.thingpic.com/images/u3/z7gW8yQ1gQAjKqq9Vmgcf47e.jpeg">Notre Dame</a> in Paris - through centuries of wars, invasions, and revolutions, it has remained beautiful and solid and standing. Sure it’s a little rougher around the edges, but it’s not a pile of rubble. Nor is it larger or more beautiful or superior in some way. It simply is.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to examples of increasing robustness in day to day life, I like to think about my finances and my schedule. As I mentioned before, I keep somewhat large cash savings around, because it makes me more indifferent to volatility. I can pay for the unexpected without indebting myself or scrambling around. Likewise, when scheduling, I build in buffers of time (a trick I originally learned in the army) so that if something unexpected happens (major accident on the freeway, a train stops traffic, there’s a marathon I didn’t know about - whatever) I still get there on time. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we get to the star of the show, the most novel category: antifragile, the true opposite of fragile. Antifragile systems actually benefit from volatility - eventually something will happen that makes them better or stronger. These systems are most often found in nature. Think of your immune system: once you have chicken pox, you’re immune. Or your muscles: lift weights and you get stronger. Most interesting of all, look at evolution: species and even ecosystems get more efficient and better adapted to their environment over time by responding to the various stressors that come up due to volatility.
</p>

<p>
Because this is exciting and sounds like a super power, everyone immediately thinks “how can I be more antifragile?” Well, there’s good and bad news. First off, the bad news is that it is more applicable to systems than to individual entities. The good news is that we create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">systems</a> in our life constantly, and we can engineer those to be as antifragile as possible. 
</p>

<p>
Taleb became wealthy by betting against the market with out of the money put options - when the financial crisis hit and the market tanked, those options paid off. He had no precise knowledge of when a crash would happen or how big it would be, but given enough time it would. So he constructed a system with <a href="http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf">convex exposure</a> where he accepted finite, limited downside constantly for near unlimited upside in the event of volatility. 
</p>

<p>
For ourselves, it helps to remember that robust is usually a necessary stepping stone to antifragile. Remember the savings we talked about? Step 1 is you don’t care about negative outcomes. Step 2 is to create ways to actively benefit from them - such as by buying undervalued stocks when there is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp">“blood in the streets”</a> or setting up positions that automatically benefit like Taleb’s. Or you might find other ways that disorder in your life can benefit you - have something read or listen to whenever you find yourself unexpectedly delayed, for example. Another favorite of mine is to practice Jocko Willink’s habit of responding to all negative situations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8">“Good.”</a> Or perhaps, invest in business ideas that take advantage of the seemingly negative, like staffing agencies in a world of <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/quit-your-job-2017/">declining full time employment</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The basics of Taleb’s framework come pretty easy, but there is so much depth there. For example, I didn’t even touch the <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/taleb_n_1.html">math</a> behind it, because that’s not my forte. I promise that as you think about these concepts, you will begin seeing them in your life and trying to find ways to apply them. If you figure out anything interesting, please let me know!

<p>
The core concept explored in this book is what is "risk" and how should we think about it in our lives, but it reaches out and touches so many more areas of interest. Taleb is shockingly smart, enjoyably contrarian, and writes in a very engaging way. This book is one of my top five life and brain changing books - you will be a little bit smarter every time you read it.

<p>
Risk fundamentally shapes some of our most critical decisions, but most of us don’t think very deeply or clearly about it. <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Taleb</a> is not like most of us. he has thought long, hard, and with great rigor about risk and randomness, and he presents that thinking most usefully and straightforwardly in Antifragile. That being said, while his writing and storytelling are superb, it’s not exactly light beach reading. Below we’re going to talk about just one of the many useful concepts presented in the book, which is a fundamentally different way to think about and evaluate risk.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/4orcemajeure/the-james-altucher-show-ep-45-nassim-taleb-why-you-should-embrace-uncertainty">his interview with James Altucher</a> recently, and I was surprised to realize I haven’t written about this book yet. You see, it lives on my shelf of “personal operating manuals” along with <i>Deep Work</i>, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <i>Tools of Titans</i>, and a few others. I am pretty sure that <i>Antifragile</i> is the “80/20” book of his <i>Incerto</i> series - it covers the key concepts, ways to apply them to your life, and just enough of the underlying math to let you know it’s serious (there’s more in the appendix if that gets you going). 
</p>

<p>
Understanding Antifragile requires rethinking the term “risk.” First off, Taleb asserts that there is no such thing as a satisfactory definition of “risk.” Risk as usually defined or described conflates three separate factors - the likelihood of an event, a party’s exposure to that likelihood, and how that party feels about that exposure. Usually you’ll see risk <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html">defined</a> as something like “the likelihood of a negative outcome times its severity.”
</p>

<p>
One problem with this is that “negative outcome” and “severity” can vary enormously depending on the entity experiencing the event. If your coffee cup is knocked off the counter, it’s going to have a bad time. If your cat falls off the counter, it’ll be fine. In both cases the objective event (falling off the counter) is identical, but the entities experiencing it are differently exposed to negative outcomes. When you add in rational thought, you get the further wrinkle that “negative” is a judgment call. While you might think something like “losing money” is intrinsically negative, it’s not so simple. What if I lose money daily but get a huge payout once a year and I’m okay with that? Or what if I decide I’m okay losing the money to have a good time (like a Vegas trip)? 
</p>

<p>
There’s an even thornier challenge besides those above, though: outside of certain fairly constrained bounds, we can’t even accurately model the likelihood of events (we think we can, but we’re very bad at it). Artificial environments that involve chance (like rolling dice or drawing cards) have relatively easy to model probabilities, as do large classes of natural phenomena that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-most-natural-phenomena-when-observed-randomly-tend-to-converge-to-a-normal-distribution-curve-If-so-can-this-be-used-as-a-hypothesis-to-claim-that-nature-follows-a-certain-pattern">fit pretty well</a> into normal distributions. But several classes of events that matter very much to our lives (financial instruments, catastrophic disasters, terrorist attacks, et cetera) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e6UKCJt-g8">cannot have their probability modeled in any meaningful, non-deceiving way</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So where does that leave us for how to think about risk in our own lives? Well, the good news is that while we can’t really nail down a scientific definition of “risk” for the whole wide world, we can do just fine in assessing risk for ourselves. To do so, we need to look at two main factors: how we feel about the outcomes and our exposure to those outcomes taking place. For example, I would very much like to continue living and would find getting killed unambiguously negative. Certain activities, like smoking, riding motorcycles, or going to dangerous neighborhoods dramatically increase my exposure to the outcome of getting killed. I don’t have to have a good model of how likely or unlikely those outcomes are to simply avoid my exposure to that risk.
</p>

<p>
In terms of personal finance, I keep a lot more cash savings than most investing professionals would advise, because savings help make me more robust - I can be more indifferent to the volatility of the world around me. Air conditioning stops working? Cool, I’ve got cash in the bank. Surprise! Nail in your tire - cash. You get the picture. Now, this works the other way as well - you can take some amount of money that you’re okay with losing and invest it in things with a low chance of paying off but with potentially unlimited returns, like out of the money options or start ups or your own entrepreneurial ventures. Taleb calls this the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads">“barbell method”</a> of investing, because he advocates having heavily safe and heavily risky investments, rather than an averaged portfolio like a business school finance class would teach you to go for.
</p>

<p>
This may come as a shock to you, but I also find Tim Ferriss’s definition of risk instructive to combine here - he looks at risk by asking whether or not something irreversible and/or massively negative may happen. By using <a href="http://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/">fear setting</a> to mitigate what you can of the likelihood and alter your perception of the negatives, you will often find that very few actions have truly irreversible massive negative outcomes. This attitude can make it easier to expose yourself to the possible upsides of volatility, such as by encouraging you to build your own business or invest a prudent amount in a highly speculative company. 
</p>

<p>
So how do you apply these concepts? We’ve talked about a few in our examples above, but here’s my top pics for most useful ways to re-think your approach to risk in your life:
</p>

<p>
Career: Corporate jobs are generally viewed as “safe” because there is very little volatility in your paycheck. Until it’s totally gone. Maybe you get laid off, or maybe you happened to be working for Enron. If this happens when you’re 23, it’s not such a big deal, but if it happens right before retirement, it can be devestating. Compare this with a skilled individual worker or independent consultant, and their pay is much more variable day to day and month to month, but they have a much tighter feedback loop: as long as you keep getting clients, you’re doing something valuable. When you start losing your ability to find them, it’s a sign you need to move on and find a new gig. 
</p>

<p>
Investing: Before we get into this, please bear in mind I am not an investment advisor of any sort, and this does not constitute specific financial advice - this paragraph is just a recommendation on where to look to learn more, not specific investment strategies. As mentioned above, a traditionally balanced portfolio basically says “let’s get rid of all the volatility except what’s inherent in the market.” The trouble is, there’s a whole damn lot of volatility inherent in the market, especially when you are looking only at equity. Much better to figure out however much money you need to not be ruined and protect it from volatility the best you can (Inflation-protected Treasuries or the like) and take whatever is left over and put it into things where you have exposure to the potential for massive upside - investing in your friend’s genius start up, opening a restaurant, writing a novel, out of the money options, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
Health and Behavior: There are some things that can greatly affect our exposure to negative health outcomes - like the previously mentioned smoking or engaging in dangerous stunts. Many of these you can completely opt out of and face no risk - which is the approach recommended by Taleb. You’ll have to decide for yourself if a non-zero chance of horrible death is worth the benefits of doing things like motorcycle riding or sky diving. On the more positive side, doing things like lifting heavy weights and walking frequently have close to zero downside (some chance of injury with weight lifting), but potentially tremendous upside to your health long term. 
</p>

<p>
This is just the tip of the iceberg with Taleb’s material, and I strongly recommend you check out not only Antifragile, but the rest of the Incerto series. We haven’t even gotten into just what “Antifragility” is, but I wanted to cover the basic approach to risk and provide some tangible ways to use it first. Let me know if you’re interested in diving deeper on this topic, and we’ll make a series of it.

The core thesis of this book is that <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull/">goals are for losers, systems are for winners, and passion is bullshit</a>. When I finally got around to actually reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely jam packed with useful little nuggets. Seriously, this is one of the highest "actionable stuff to fluff" self-improvement books I've ever read. While it is full of specific tactics, the real value of this book is how it points out the complex system that leads to your energy, output, and ultimately success.

I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but to be perfectly honest, I was worried it was one of those books where if you know the premise you don't need to read it. What I had overlooked is the degree to which making the case for checklists would motivate me to actually change my behavior. The examples given of lives saved and fortunes made through the seemingly simple expedient of using checklists are quite impressive. Plus, there's a neat checklist for creating your own checklist in the back.

If you want to up your game to true professionalism in just about any field, check out this book.

This book might seem out of left field for those of you outside of the military or law enforcement, but I think it has several valuable lessons for everybody. First off, it will help you to understand many of the dynamics going on - on both sides - of the deadly force encounters you hear about in the news. Secondly, it's breakdown of the physical, psychological, and environmental factors of the most extreme kind of stress can be reverse-engineered to the more mild kinds of stress most of us are lucky enough to deal with. Finally, it just might help you prepare for unlikely but terrible life-threatening situations.

I've been a fan of Ferriss for years, but I think this book is far and away his best yet. It's chock full of great stuff that you can use right now to make your life better - whether to get healthy, make money, or feel more calm in your life. If you only ever read one book of his, make it this one. Hell, if you only read one self-improvement book period, make it this one.

This book is a classic for a reason - I've taken my sweet ass time getting to it, but I am absolutely hooked. Drawing on a combination of scholarly experiments and "in the trenches" experience with sales training, this book points out thenearly automatic triggers we have evolved to be good, cooperative members ofsociety and how "compliance professionals" (salesmen, recruiters, and cons) use these techniques to get their way without you even knowing what they're about. This book is doubly valuable - you learn how to spot unscrupulous applications of the techniques as well as how to use them in your own (hopefully legitimate) endeavors. For lots of interesting extra context, check out Scott Adams's <a href="http://goldmine.marketing/scott-adams-original-persuasion-reading-list-from-2016/">Persuasion Reading List</a>.

By now, you've probably heard about how bad sitting is for you, and maybe you've even seen or used a standing desk somewhere. Well, this book lays down the case for why sitting is literally killing us in stark, terrifying detail, and proceeds to provide specific, step by step instructions on how to do something about it. It's not as simple as buying a standing desk and burning your chair - you have to re-teach your body appropriate ways of moving after years oflearning the wrong thing. Fortunately, the prescriptions in this book are easy to follow and will give you immediate relief as well as long-lasting solutions to problems like stiff backs, joint pain, and chronic stress.

In this book, Harris makes a case for spiritual practice without the scaffolding and foundation of religious beliefs. While he approaches it as an avowed and enthusiastic atheist, I think that the core insight that there are certain practices you can adopt to bring peace, contentment, and compassion into your life without adopting beliefs you are uncomfortable with is useful regardless of your religious convictions. The descriptions of what it feels like to meditate and what it feels like to think you're meditating when you aren't really are worth the price of admission by themselves.

My name is Jeff Russell. This webstead is my home on the internet. I plan to share my thoughts on the many things I'm interested in. Hopefully you'll find them interesting too.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've had somewhat sundered "selves" on the web - I had a blog and social media account for gaming, another blog and webstead for coaching and thoughts on business and getting more work done and such, and I've lurked around reading but not putting out there my interests in things like philosophy, magic, and religion. After listening to Naval Ravikant <a href="https://nav.al/rich">talk about</a> why you want to welcome and make the most out of what you have that no one else does, and to Josh Waitzkin <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/06/19/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-distilled/">talk about</a> how greatness comes from "embracing your funk", I made up my mind to set that right - hence, here we are, with one stead to put all of those many interests.  
</p>

<p>
This webstead is largely built following the advice in <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed to Last</a> by Jeff Huang. That's why almost everything is on one page, the formatting is minimal, and the html/css is as simple and vanilla as I can make it.
