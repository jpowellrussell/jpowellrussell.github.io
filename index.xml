        <title>Building a Knowledge Handling Set Up - Part 1 - Introduction</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /thinking/2020-05-26-khs_series_intro/ -&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m kicking off a series on building a &lt;em&gt;Knowledge Handling Set Up&lt;/em&gt;
(KHS). There are many tools, frameworks, and ways of working out there
for learning and holding onto knowledge, and it can be hard to fit them
together into a whole that works for you, what I call a KHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is a bit unlike some of my others, in that I&amp;rsquo;ll be working
it it out as I go. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve done most of my thinking and
testing hidden away on my own, and only shared things when they&amp;rsquo;re
pretty well settled. I want to change that, for I think you and I will
both be better off if I lay bare more of the starts, stops, and dead
ends that go into getting to output I can stand behind. Even more than
most things, a KHS has to be built /for you/, so I think that showing
my way of working will be more worthwhile than sharing what works /for
me/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, below I lay out what a &amp;ldquo;Knowledge Handling Set Up&amp;rdquo; needs to have to
earn the name, and then step through the framework I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with to
get to one. That framework is made up of bringing in new knowledge,
working through it, and doing something worthwhile with it once it&amp;rsquo;s in
your set up. I believe the coming posts will follow this framework, but
with a working series, that may change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unfolding-knowledge-handling-set-up&#34;&gt;Unfolding &amp;ldquo;Knowledge Handling Set Up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-08-11-creativity-part-1-defining-creativity/&#34;&gt;might&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-10-27-storytelling-part-1-introduction/&#34;&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt;,
I like to start series out by laying out the meaning of key words as
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using them. My working meaning for &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Handling Set Up&lt;/strong&gt;
(KHS) is: &amp;ldquo;A way of bringing in and holding onto knowledge in such a way
that it is at hand whenever it will be helpful.&amp;rdquo; There are three main
bits: 1) &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, 2) &lt;em&gt;at hand&lt;/em&gt;, and 3) &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack each
of these bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;knowledge&#34;&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, I mean anything that can be known: words, knowhow,
insights, crafts, and so forth. This one&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward, but
I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out that &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo; holds more than book smarts -
learning a martial art or yoga or the like count as much, but won&amp;rsquo;t be
where we spend most of our time in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-hand&#34;&gt;At Hand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;at hand&lt;/em&gt;, I mean that I can get to the knowledge without much work.
That might mean memorizing it, or it might mean putting it into a tool
that I can use with little enough trouble for it not to matter that it&amp;rsquo;s
outside my head. Note that what falls under &amp;ldquo;little enough trouble&amp;rdquo; will
rest on what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with the knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helpful&#34;&gt;Helpful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;, I mean that having that knowledge in the right spot in my
KHS lets me do something I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to otherwise. &lt;em&gt;Helpful&lt;/em&gt; is
tightly linked with &lt;em&gt;at hand&lt;/em&gt; above, as what I hope to do with the
knowledge will drive what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to hang onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bringing-in-new-knowledge&#34;&gt;Bringing in New Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole world of knowledge out there, so we need to think about
how to bring it in to our KHS. I break that down into three main steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding knowledge you might learn, 2) sifting for the best stuff in
what you find, and 3) processing it to get the good stuff into your set
up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding&#34;&gt;Finding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us, today we can find knowledge more readily than ever
before. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to think about where and how you&amp;rsquo;re looking
for new knowledge, both in an ongoing way (what blogs to follow, where
to get book recommendations) and with goals in mind (I want to learn
more about blockchain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sifting&#34;&gt;Sifting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of ways to find input out there today, and many of
them have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law&#34;&gt;rather a lot of
crap&lt;/a&gt;. So, how do you
keep away from the crap and get to the good stuff? Worse, how do you
break out the truly great from the merely good? Harder still, how do you
put aside &amp;ldquo;great for others&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;great for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;processing&#34;&gt;Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve found a work that is truly great, matchlessly fitted to you and
where your knowledge-seeking are right now - it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; the right
book/paper/class for you. So, what do you do with it? Even in a work
chock full of great stuff, some of it will be better, some worse, some
stuff you&amp;rsquo;ll know, and some stuff over your head. So you need a way to
work out the right amount of time and drive and how to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pulling-up-the-knowledge&#34;&gt;Pulling Up the Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve put in the work to bring some new knowledge in your KHS, so how
will you call up that knowledge when you need it? You can put it into
your head, where you&amp;rsquo;ll find it when you go looking, or where it might
pop up to surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-knowledge-in-your-head&#34;&gt;Put Knowledge In Your Head&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest and most wieldy way to handle knoweldge is to, you know,
actually &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; it. Put that knowledge inside your head so that you can
work with it in ways mindful and otherwise. Since this takes the most
work and uses up the dearest resource (room in your mind), you have to
be careful about what you keep this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-knowledge-where-you-can-find-it&#34;&gt;Put Knowledge Where You Can Find It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we do with old-fangled lookup systems, like a file cabinet
or binder, but let&amp;rsquo;s not knock it. You think about an article you read a
while back that might come in handy, look through where you keep it,
find it, and skim it to find the helpful bits. Let&amp;rsquo;s stop for a breath
and acknowledge how amazing this everday thing is, still more so with
digital storage: without even getting online, my database on my computer
holds more works than most &lt;em&gt;countries&lt;/em&gt; had to hand not too long ago. And
I don&amp;rsquo;t even have to climb up one of those sweet ladders with wheels on
the top to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-knowledge-where-it-can-find-you&#34;&gt;Put Knowledge Where It Can Find You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the most useful knowledge is that which we didn&amp;rsquo;t know we needed
until it pops up and suddenly clicks, both &lt;a href=&#34;https://electricliterature.com/surprising-yet-inevitable-ending-read-like-a-writer/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;surprising and
inevitable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
In the past you might only have found this when talking with smart
people that know things you don&amp;rsquo;t or by sheer dumb luck on page 237 of
the book you&amp;rsquo;re reading. These days, we are lucky to have tools that can
help do this for us, like search engines and database software. This is
especially helpful in generating new insights and other generative
creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;doing-something-with-the-knowledge&#34;&gt;Doing something with the knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need something worthwhile to do with this knowledge you&amp;rsquo;re
working so hard to get a handle on. Though this comes last, it steers
much of what comes before, as what you want to do with knowledge will
drive what you bring in and how you pull it up. I find it helpful to
think about the &amp;ldquo;so what&amp;rdquo; of a given chunk of knowledge, to have goals
and undertakings the knowledge might help, and to grow the likelihood
that each chunk of knowledge will be helpful more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finding-the-so-what&#34;&gt;Finding the &amp;ldquo;So What&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more to learn than any of us can ever handle, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to think
about you&amp;rsquo;re learning what you are. I&amp;rsquo;m bad at following this wisdom
myself, as I lean strongly toward &amp;ldquo;learn ALL THE THINGS&amp;rdquo;. While this is
great as an inwrought drive to seek out knowledge, it can often lead to
wasting time on unweighty things. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on thinking more
carefully through &amp;ldquo;what does this knowledge do for me? what is
worthwhile about learning it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals-and-undertakings&#34;&gt;Goals and Undertakings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once way to make clear why you&amp;rsquo;re learning something is to link it to
named goals or undertakings. If you&amp;rsquo;re building a dating app for dogs,
then it&amp;rsquo;s likely helpful to learn things about the mating behavior of
dogs, the spending habits of dog owners, smart phone app economics, and
so forth. If you&amp;rsquo;re not writing one, then not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;un--and-re-setting&#34;&gt;Un- and Re-Setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one is a bit unlike the other two. Rather than linking
knowledge to an end you already have in mind, this one is about upping
the likelihood that any given bit of knowledge will turn out to be
helpful by making it more readily link up with a wider field of other
bits of knowledge. You do this by taking chunks of knowledge and carving
away the setting it came from (un-setting), so that you can more readily
fit it into some other setting (re-setting). I learned this thought from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes&amp;amp;qid=1590701814&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Take Smart
Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
of which more later in this series. I like to think of it as turning as
much of your knowledge as you can into Lego blocks that you can fit
together in new and awesome ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s what I hope to go through with you over the next handful of
posts! A friend of mine once told me I ought to find undertakings that
&amp;ldquo;scratch more than one itch&amp;rdquo; as a way to deal with my manifold
interests, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to do here, using the writing of
these posts not only to work out what might go into a KHS, but to get
some practice putting it together as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any tools, ways of working, or works that you love in this
field, do please share them, and let me know any of the above bits you&amp;rsquo;d
like to hear more about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2019-06-12-best-spam-comment-ever/ -&lt;p&gt;Wow, I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give any sort of attention to a spam comment, but this was too fantastic to pass up (posted to several of my posts as comments and removed, but good job, spammer, your post is getting immortalized here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vampires is not at all like in the movies or books. Sure, I understand. You are young you have the whole world open to you. You can be anything that you choose if you apply yourself and try hard to work toward that goal. But being a Vampire is not what it seems like. It’s a life full of good, and amazing things. We are as human as you are.. It’s not what you are that counts, But how you choose to be. Do you want a life full of interesting things? Do you want to have power and influence over others? To be charming and desirable? To have wealth, health, and longevity? contact the Vampires Lord on his Email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Richvampirekindom@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Richvampirekindom@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Level Up Your Process to Learn Better, Faster (Learning Overview Part 1)</title>
        <link>/coaching/2019-03-15-level-up-your-process-to-learn-better-faster-learning-overview-part-1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/coaching/2019-03-15-level-up-your-process-to-learn-better-faster-learning-overview-part-1/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2019-03-15-level-up-your-process-to-learn-better-faster-learning-overview-part-1/ -&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I’ve put some time into improving &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I learn, and I’d like to share some of that in a series on “metalearning” (learning how to learn). While there are many things I want to cover, from mental models to specific tools, the underlying logic will be to look at learning as a &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;. Taking a process focus has several benefits - let’s walk through some of the biggest to kick off this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an assertion: bettering your process is the best way to get better at learning. Sure, you could work harder, do smart drugs, or try any number of things to learn better, but I think process is the way to go. Why is that? For one, I’m a former consultant, so I loves me some process design. More seriously, I like processes because they are effort-based, holographic, and compoundable. Let’s step through those:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effort Based&lt;/em&gt; - processes are not defined by what outcomes you achieve, but rather by what work you do to try to get there - that means that you can focus more on what’s under your control and less on what’s not, because life happens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holographic&lt;/em&gt; - if you improve one piece of a process and leave the rest alone, you still improve your overall work. You can largely separate out improvements into discrete chunks and work on one at a time, which is helpful for building habits and sustaining motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compoundable&lt;/em&gt; - Since processes focus on getting the  work right, rather than only on the outcome (which likely includes factors outside of our control) and you can work on one piece of that work at a time, every improvement you make builds on all previous improvements. Further, since processes are an explicit way of looking at the work you do, you can find where processes influence each other and improve those connections, making both  processes better. If you set a goal of losing 15 pounds, once you’re there, you’re done. But if you build a process of living healthier, every tweak you make to your diet, exercise, and sleep will add up until you’re living a significantly different life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’ve been talking about “process” a lot already without defining it. Since I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/10/27/storytelling-part-1-introduction&#34;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/11/creativity-part-1-defining-creativity&#34;&gt;define&lt;/a&gt; terms in the first post of a series, let’s do it with our key term, “process”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A process is a sequence of specific, repeatable actions, or a collection of such sequences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes don’t have to be documented, but doing so makes them clearer and easier to make better. You’ll also notice that processes need not be habitual - though it’s best to make the most important ones habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the definition above, we already have some processes we follow to learn - we just might not know what they are, and we might not know how well they work (or don’t). So, what’s the first step for making them better? Write them down. To do so, I’m a big fan of mapping them in a diagram (again, former consultant). If you don’t know &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_mapping&#34;&gt;process mapping&lt;/a&gt;, you might check out some of the finer points, but if you’ve ever seen a &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/210/&#34;&gt;flowchart&lt;/a&gt;, you know enough to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If visuals aren’t your speed, lists or outlines will often do the trick. Since these are our own personal processes, we’re not trying to make them readily usable by anybody. Instead, we want to get to a level of clarity where you, and more importantly, &lt;em&gt;you in the future&lt;/em&gt;, can pick it up and know what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, before you think about any ways to get better, you might find it very helpful to map out your “as is” learning process - or at least a subset of it. You might pick one thing you do to learn - say, reading or taking notes or the like. Whatever you pick, write it down in all its messy, haphazard glory. If you already see stuff that you want to change, hold off for now - you want to start with an accurate picture of where you are today. Whatever flaws your current learning process might have, if you’ve been honest and careful in documenting it, it has one, huge positive in its favor: &lt;em&gt;you actually follow it&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/this-1-tip-from-tim-ferriss-will-propel-your-startups-productivity.html&#34;&gt;so-so approach you do is better than the perfect one that you abandon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve got our process down on paper, we can start looking at bettering it. The rest of this series will go into lots of nitty-gritty details, but here’s a few overall thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and easiest, make it a system you will truly follow. Look for things you &lt;em&gt;mean to do&lt;/em&gt;, but never follow through. Then make these easier. In the long run, you will likely fail at anything that feels &lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/self-discipline-youre-doing-it-wrong&#34;&gt;too hard&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve talked before about &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/House-That-Cleans-Itself-Steps-ebook/dp/B00BFH3UX6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1552596081&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House that Cleans Itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and its twofold wisdom of setting “good enough” goals and making the right thing as easy as possible. Find ways to make it easier to consistently get close to what you’re after. Find it hard to read for 30 minutes every day? Try 5. Never have your book? Get the Kindle app on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, look for things that you find hard or irksome, even if you consistently do them, and look for ways to make them better/faster/easier. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/via-negativa-adding-to-your-life-by-subtracting/&#34;&gt;Getting rid of the bad&lt;/a&gt; will likely help more than adding new good stuff, most of all when you’re starting out. Pain in the ass typing your notes? Find a way to export them automatically. Miss writing something down because it’s a hassle to get your notebook?  Buy a smaller one you can keep in your pocket. Sometimes forget to go over flashcards? Get &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; and set a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, look for “processes” that are poorly defined. Maybe your “as-is” process just says “Read books sometimes.” In which case, good for you for accurately documenting that. Your next step might be to give yourself some bare-bones steps, like: “1) Find a book that sounds interesting, 2) Skim it to confirm I want to read it, 3) Read it and take notes.” Just by adding those steps, you now have three specific areas where you can look for improvement moving forward instead of the big and fuzzy “reading.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’ve no doubt gathered, there’s a lot of ground we might cover in this series. So I’m not entirely sure where we’ll go. That being said, some of the topics I’d like to dig into include specific learning processes, digital and physical tools, quirks of how the brain works (and how to use them), thinking tools and methods, and selecting learning materials. With such a range of things to talk about, we’ll have to settle for breadth over depth, but I want to really tie together the way that a process-focused approach can help your learning efforts across the board. If any of these topics really get your motor going, please let me know and share your favorite resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Removing Support from Zak Smith</title>
        <link>/gaming/2019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 15:51:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith/ -&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE February 14th, 2019: Zak has issued a statement responding &lt;a href=&#34;https://officialzsannouncements.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-statement.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am not convinced to change my position below, but it introduces some doubt. I may have further thoughts as more information comes out, but I encourage you to read and evaluate it for yourself.   UPDATE February 16th 2019: I reworded the bit about what it would take to change my stance to include adequate evidence that the claims were false, rather than only saying evidence of growth on Zak&amp;rsquo;s part would do it.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone reading this has likely already seen, Zak Smith/Sabbath&amp;rsquo;s longtime girlfriend Mandy Morbid has posted that Zak has done some rather awful stuff to her and others. I came across it as re-shared (with permission) over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://dungeonsdonuts.tumblr.com/post/182722330779/mandy-morbid-comes-forward-about-zak-s-violence&#34;&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Donuts by Kiel Chenier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then read Patrick Stuart&amp;rsquo;s response to the news here on &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2019/02/you-should-read-this.html&#34;&gt;False Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I have chosen to believe these claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two folks who I have had enough online interaction with to find sane
and credible are saying their claims are consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The claims are to specific instances and patterns of behavior by an
individual, rather than relying on rhetorical dirty tricks, like
saying an &lt;a href=&#34;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122&#34;&gt;unwillingness to admit to guilt is evidence of
guilt&lt;/a&gt;, or arguing based on group
membership rather than individual action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot discern any gain or motivation for lying about these
claims, except perhaps to hurt Zak to &amp;ldquo;get back&amp;rdquo; for hurt done, but
see above for why I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change my mind, I&amp;rsquo;d need to be presented with some pretty damn compelling counter-evidence that goes beyond the usual standards of internet-proof (something like a video of someone involved saying &amp;ldquo;I made that shit up&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s take down Zak whatever the cost&amp;rdquo; or the findings of a court of law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This news makes me rather sad. I have admired Zak&amp;rsquo;s work and his critical judgement and explanation of works of art for a long time now. He introduced me via his blog and Google+ to most of my favorite RPG creators and helped provide the impetus for a number of awesome collaborations. I still think &amp;ldquo;DIY&amp;rdquo; is a better rallying ethic than &amp;ldquo;Old School&amp;rdquo; (but continue to use &amp;ldquo;OSR&amp;rdquo; as a more helpful, if vague, label for the sort of D&amp;amp;D and sort of blogs I find most interesting). I have found his assertions about the Socratic method, the importance of truth, and the need to have and enforce standards in creative communities to be helpful in shaping my own thinking, even when I have disagreed with parts. Unfortunately, now he gets to help me by providing another example of a creative person who makes great stuff but seems to be personally reprehensible, leaving all of us to figure out how to make use (or not) of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until and unless I am presented with credible evidence of major personal development and change on Zak&amp;rsquo;s behalf [NEW 2/16/19: or evidence of the sort mentioned above that the claims are baseless], I will take the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will not direct future attention or money to Zak, as the
personality and behavioral problems described by Mandy and Patrick
and others are pervasive and poisonous enough to make all of his
discourse suspect, and I wish to help provide consequences for such
behavior - concretely, this means I&amp;rsquo;m removing him from my blog
roll, unsubscribing from his Patreon, and will not buy things in a
way that will benefit him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for gaming works already bought and blog posts already read, I
will continue to use and enjoy them, but with perhaps a more
critical eye to any implicit beliefs that may be in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I go over any elements of my own thinking and view of the world,
if it comes up that it was influenced by Zak, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to
re-evaluate with a more critical eye - for example, at the moment I
still believe in the value of a commitment to truth over &amp;ldquo;niceness&amp;rdquo;,
and the socratic method as a way of finding truth, but I&amp;rsquo;m
re-thinking some of the more abrasive implementations of it that Zak
had convinced me might be worthwhile, if painful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will not be removing my past posts on Zak&amp;rsquo;s material here on the
blog, including reviews and the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/Middenheim&#34;&gt;Vornheiming
Middenheim&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
series, but I will post a link to this post at the top of them to
give anyone encountering him for the first time the chance to decide
for themselves how to approach his work (or not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2014/07/psa-this-post-is-full-of-lies-and.html&#34;&gt;old post publicly supporting him against negative
claims&lt;/a&gt;,
I have added a more explicit retraction, but I am leaving it on the
site in the interest of transparency on what I have believed in the
past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Fellhold Fiend Race, Class, and Magic</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-08-23-fiends-in-fellhold/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 12:21:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2018-08-23-fiends-in-fellhold/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-08-23-fiends-in-fellhold/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like demons? They are awesome, and from the moment I started the Fellhold reboot, I knew they&amp;rsquo;d play a big role. Please find below Fiends as a Race, Fiends as a Class, and Fiendish Magic. But first, a quick intro on just what a Fiend is in Fellhold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiends-in-fellhold&#34;&gt;Fiends in Fellhold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-soul-economy-in-fellhold.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, fiends in Fellhold were born when the gods were killed and their blood rained down on the dumb things of the earth. As such, fiends are somewhat like nature spirits or Kami, bound to plants, or animals, or inanimate objects. On the other hand, because they were born out of an act of sorcerous malice, they are twisted and malicious, so they are also somewhat like Chaos Demons. Finally, because they come from divine blood, they have an inborn need for lawfulness and keeping agreements along with a yearning for the true life denied them, and so they are also somewhat like Christian Devils. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, basically they&amp;rsquo;re a bunch of assholes. Guess what the most popular PC race is in my home campaign so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiends-as-a-race&#34;&gt;Fiends as a Race&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellhold uses split race and class. If you use a race-as-class game, I would recommend smashing this together with the Fiend class below, as the class assumes the restrictions and benefits of this race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fiends&#34;&gt;Fiends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiends are the warped and wicked remnants of the world’s nature spirits. They vary greatly in both power and form from minor animalistic sprites of rocks and saplings to mighty humanoid powers worshiped as gods. A player character fiend is far more powerful than many of these minor beings, but is still pretty far down the ladder. Fiends thrive on souls and worship, and most turn all of their doing towards those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;special&#34;&gt;Special&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every fiend must have a stead, a place or thing that it is bound to. The fiend cannot move farther away from it than its level in miles (or level in districts, if more useful). Steads can be carried with fiends of the PC’s size and power, but if a  stead is destroyed, the fiend truly dies. If otherwise killed, the fiend will reform at its stead in 1d4 urbancrawl turns (weeks). If a fiend swears an oath or signs a contract, it cannot willingly break that deal (but of course, the word of the deal, not necessarily the spirit). If the fiend involuntarily breaks a deal or oath, it takes D6xLevel damage. Fiends can also be summoned, compelled, and bound as NPC fiends. Fiends must have a Use Name, Greater Name, and True Name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiends-as-a-class&#34;&gt;Fiends as a Class&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was a lot of fun to design - it was one of the first ideas I had for the reboot, but getting it to work right took a long time and exposure to some cool new ideas. This class is mostly derivative, smashing together Mateo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/2015/03/cult-class.html&#34;&gt;Godling&lt;/a&gt;, Skerples&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/03/osr-class-sorcerer.html&#34;&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/08/osr-class-witch-coven.html&#34;&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, and Joseph Manola&amp;rsquo;s/Skerples&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/09/bx-class-extras.html&#34;&gt;Extras/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-class-many-goblins.html&#34;&gt;Many Goblins&lt;/a&gt;. I will say that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty pleased with how the &lt;em&gt;Soul Hoarder&lt;/em&gt; class feature worked out, though - that one&amp;rsquo;s mine, as is the &lt;em&gt;Possess&lt;/em&gt; feature, though that&amp;rsquo;s certainly based on other stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class is maybe super powerful? I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to playtest it yet, but I suspect that the starting crappiness combined with the hefty strain dice cost will keep there from being too many shenanigans. See the Fiendish magic section below for more on the buying souls thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that my starting equipment is extremely stingy, because I do random equipment by class &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2018/07/money-equipment-in-fellhold.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Base Class&amp;rdquo; below is for those folks who don&amp;rsquo;t use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;GLOG&lt;/a&gt;. Just take that class for experience, saves, gear restrictions, and so forth, and then apply these powers at levels that seem appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fiend-class&#34;&gt;Fiend Class&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiends as a class are tiny beings that wish to grow their power by gathering souls and worshippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Ability&lt;/strong&gt;: Soul Hoarder&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Per Template&lt;/strong&gt;: +1 Casting Die&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;: Stead&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Word &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Ghost Talk, Possess &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Fools &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Second Word&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESTRICTIONS  You cannot take templates in the Fiend Class unless your first template is “Fiend”.  You cannot take souls by force or steal them, you must buy all souls and bits thereof by coming to an agreement, and as a Fiend, you are bound to follow that deal to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PERKS  You can turn insubstantial at will (can only interact with the physical world through sense and speaking).  You can disappear and reform at your Stead in 1d3 rounds at will.  You can grow or shrink to any size from that of a mouse to your maximum (1 Size up from Tiny per 6 Con, rounded down)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLASS FEATURES&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Soul Hoarder&lt;/em&gt;  You begin play Tiny (~2’ tall) and barely substantial, and your Strength, Dexterity, and constitution begin at 1 (roll other stats normally). You have disadvantage on any physical attacks or other rolls against larger foes. You can improve your stats by buying soul bits. You lose any benefits if you lose the associated soul bits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word&lt;/em&gt;  You have power over one random fiendish word and can cast fiendish spells using it. See Fiendish Magic in the Magic section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost Talk&lt;/em&gt;  You can talk to ghosts at will, but not any other kind dead that you wouldn’t normally be able to speak with. Most ghosts are somewhat faded or mad, and might not have much useful to say, but some might be willing to make deals. Note that ghosts are made up of soul bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possess&lt;/em&gt;  You can strive to take over living beings. To do so, choose a number of casting dice to roll. Add [SUM] to your Wisdom and make an opposed Wisdom save (both sides roll, highest roll that still passes wins). Take Strain Dice as usual. You are now in control for a number of rounds equal to your level. Retest at the end of each interval. Three failed rolls in a row change the duration to “Concentrate&amp;rdquo;.  When you leave the body you are possessing, you reappear at your stead. You may not take the body further from your stead than you can normally go.     &lt;em&gt;Fools&lt;/em&gt;  You gain a gaggle of worshippers convinced that you will grant them power, wealth, fame, and so forth in exchange for their devotion. They are not skilled, clever, or hardy, but they are very loyal. You may whisper in their minds at any time. The number seems to vary from time to time and place to place, and they stay together as a group, taking up roughly 20’x20’.  If you must know the precise number, there are 1d12+6, but this will vary every time you check. They will strongly prefer to remain within 10’ of you, and their ability to follow complex instructions decreases dramatically if you are not within sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they are within 10’ of you, any ranged attacks targeting you will hit them instead. Treat all fools as one hireling, with a shared pool of HP at one HD less than you and one action per round. When they lose HP, that number of fools die in a background sort of way. Area of effect spells only affect them once. If reduced to zero HP, they lay on the ground moaning and wounded, and if reduced below zero HP, they die in a tragicomic fashion. New fools will be drawn to you in 1d3 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fools cannot be trusted with any gear, and so have no gear slots and will never fight with anything more than shivs and bites and scratches (1d6, Close).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If put to work, Fools count as 10 workers for the first hour, 5 for the next, and give up after that without specific threats, promises, or gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fools may perform a ritual to call on your power. It takes two full rounds (automatically act last in second round) of chanting and waving their arms about and grants 1 Casting Die toward a use of your Word. You may not invest further casting dice in this spell, but you also take no Strain Dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Word&lt;/em&gt;  You gain a second Word that you use just like your first, or even put them together for new effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPELL LIST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flesh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hunger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sickness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sloth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tinker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIEND MISHAPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain 1 Strain Die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take 1d6 damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effect targets random person or thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose 1 Casting Die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insubstantial 1d6 rounds (can’t interact with physical world, except to sense and speak)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose your physical form. Reform at your stead in 1d3 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIEND DOOMS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unstable: lose your physical form. Reform at your stead in 1d3 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal: you are insubstantial for 3 days. Cannot interact with the physical world at all except to sense and speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected by the World: reality no longer allows your intrusion, your stead is a mundane item, and you are trapped in the ghost world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BASE CLASS&lt;br&gt;
Elf. (Magic-User if Elf is not a class).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiendish-magic&#34;&gt;Fiendish Magic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the rest of this stuff, this magic system is based on Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html&#34;&gt;GLOG stuff&lt;/a&gt;, but with a heavy influence from Skerples&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/03/osr-class-sorcerer.html&#34;&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. I also checked out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185959/Godbound-A-Game-of-Divine-Heroes-Free-Edition&#34;&gt;Godbound&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/3482/Sine-Nomine-Publishing&#34;&gt;Kevin Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, but other than some inspiration on which words to use, I ended up not using much of that system - it&amp;rsquo;s neat, but I think it works better in a game where that&amp;rsquo;s the whole point, rather than one class&amp;rsquo;s powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t run this yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how creative players will be or how much of a pain in the ass it will be to GM. Half the reason fiends work this way is that I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to write spell lists if I can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and see above for Word List, Mishaps, and Dooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiendish Magic  Fiends are made of the stuff of magic, and so can wield powers over a broad range of things related to the kind of magic they’re made of. As such, they have open-ended powers related to a word (or two for higher level fiends). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WORDS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using Words&lt;/em&gt;  You are a being with power over one random word from the list below, which will be clearly reflected in your nature. When you wish to shape the world through your word, describe to the GM what you wish to do, who will give you a TN. Roll a number of casting dice of your choice and compare [SUM] to the TN along with your full pool of &lt;em&gt;Strain Dice&lt;/em&gt; (see below). The GM will describe what has actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;  Setting Target Numbers and assigning Strain Dice are up to the GM, but the below guidelines might prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy: 3  Challenging: 7  Hard: 10  Mind-Blowing: 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage: [SUM] + [DICE]  Effect Permanent: Requires 4 CD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Use of Power: +1 SD  More Targets: +1 SD  Area the size of a wagon: +1 SD  Area the size of an apartment: +2 SD  Area the size of a building: +3 SD  Effect lasts [DICE] minutes: +1 SD  Effect lasts [DICE] hours: +1 SD  Effect lasts [DICE] days: +1 SD  Create Something Tangible: +1 SD  Each Step of Size of Thing Created Above Tiny: +1 SD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXHAUSTION AND STRAIN DICE&lt;br&gt;
Unlike other spellcasters, Fiends never exhaust their Casting Dice. Instead, every time they make a casting roll, they add a number of &lt;strong&gt;Strain Dice&lt;/strong&gt; to their dice pool determined by the use. Use a different color of dice. Whenever the Fiend casts, they must roll all Strain dice. They do not count for [SUM] or [DICE], but do count for doubles or triples to determine mishaps and Dooms. Strain dice disappear at the witching hour or can be removed through rituals performed by the Fiend’s worshippers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WORSHIP&lt;br&gt;
A fiend’s Fools can perform rituals to grant the fiend more power when casting a single spell or to remove strain dice. Rituals last a number of hours equal to the total number of casting dice to be used or Strain Dice to be removed. If used to cast a spell, the ritual grants one additional casting die, to a maximum number of dice equal to the Fiend’s level (maximum of five casting dice ever). If used to remove Strain Dice, it removes a number equal to the number of hours spent, to a maximum of the Fiend’s level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUYING &amp;amp; SELLING SOUL BITS&lt;br&gt;
A person may sell one or more of their Soul Bits, either while living, or upon their death. Fiends may buy souls in order to gain specific effects. Anyone else buying a soul or a soul bit simply has the right to do as they please with that bit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managing a Living World with Flexible Reaction Rolls</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-08-22-managing-living-world-with-flexible/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 11:58:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2018-08-22-managing-living-world-with-flexible/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-08-22-managing-living-world-with-flexible/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to be a cliche, but this idea literally came to me in the shower, though only in the form of &amp;ldquo;how might I smash together Flexible Reaction Rolls and John&amp;rsquo;s method of using reaction rolls to change rumors?&amp;rdquo; I then went back to current draft of how to handle jobs the PCs have been offered but passed up and saw a note to consider treating them like &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130613034002/http://intwischa.com/2011/05/house-rule-for-tracking-ammo/&#34;&gt;Usage Dice&lt;/a&gt;. I then had to noodle a bit on what each die would represent, and the below is what I came up with. All this might be way too fiddly, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to try it out in play yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;status-of-unattended-jobs-or-rumors--when-to-check--as-with-all-rolls-this-is-at-the-gms-discretion-but-some-options-include&#34;&gt;Status of Unattended Jobs or Rumors  &lt;strong&gt;When to Check&lt;/strong&gt;  As with all rolls, this is at the GM&amp;rsquo;s discretion, but some options include:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every week for especially big/important jobs or rumors, or those of
PC&amp;rsquo;s home district&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a new rumor is picked up by the PCs, update the others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When specifically asked by the PCs (&amp;ldquo;Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s up with that job
the fence offered us?&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you need ideas for adventure hooks or complications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Roll&lt;/strong&gt;  Each rumor or job will have a &amp;ldquo;source die&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;world die&amp;rdquo;. The source die represents whatever started the rumor or the person offering the job. The world die is for how it&amp;rsquo;s interacting with everyone else. In the case of a job, it will likely reflect those trying to complete it, whereas with a rumor it will most often represent the scope and fervor with which it is spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default for each die is a d6, but it may be any die along the usual die chain for reaction rolls (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). Whichever dice are selected, note them separately next to the rumor (Such as &amp;ldquo;d4, d6&amp;rdquo; to indicate a rumor with a d4 source and a d6 world die).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking Status&lt;/strong&gt;  For any rumor which you are checking, take out dice matching your source and world dice. If the same size, use two different colors and note which is which. Roll the dice and interpret using the same framework as a reaction roll, with lower pointing towards failure, falsehood, or complications, and higher pointing to success, resolution, or more truth. You can use the below table as a guide, but use your judgment based on the particular rumor or job. Change the rumor in your notes appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die Size Changes&lt;/strong&gt;  If either die comes up a maximum result, step it up to the next die size for future rolls. If either die comes up a &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; step it down one size for future rolls. Update the dice in your notes for the rumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losing a Die&lt;/strong&gt;  If either die comes up a &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; on a d4, that die is removed. This will require some interpretation, and you should use the total of the roll to color that interpretation, but in the case of a source die, it will likely mean that either the true thing that inspired the rumor is resolved or that the rumor has been found to be totally false. For a job, the source die disappearing likely means that the person or group offering the job is no longer able or willing to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the world die, in the case of rumors, a lost die might mean that no one is talking about it anymore, or that the exaggeration around the core of truth has been discovered. For jobs, it likely means something has happened to someone or some group that tried to accomplish the job, but it might also mean that the situation has changed to make the job no longer workable (a time window has passed, better guards have been put in, and so forth). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your judgment on whether the rumor or job should persist in some new form or be replaced in this case - again, use the total result of the roll to get some idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Die Represents: The intensity of the nugget of truth at the core of the rumor. In this case, one spawning has indeed come out off, but the rest of the house is trying to keep its members contained (some truth, but not as big a deal as the rumor says - d6)  World Die Represents: How much does the public care about this rumor (juicy enough to spread, not immediate enough to really grab you - d6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: A full spawning of insane crabmen murdered several of their family members and escaped, hiding somewhere in the city, preying on their neighbors  3-5: House Mud is buying an unusually high number of thralls, at an alarming rate. What are they doing with them?  6-8: Nothing changes  9-11: House Mud has been quietly locking up some of their members for unnatural tastes  12+: The head spawning of House Mud completely wiped out the most recent spawning and has been quietly paying weregild to local families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;  Biblook, a passionate crabman Sage of Soul Economics, is hilariously out of fashion on account of his insistence of affecting the look, mannerisms, and worldview of the Witch Kings of old, wants the humiliation of his mother, whom he accuses of plagiarism, and will in return grant whoever does so safe haven secured through his considerable wealth.  Source Die Represents: Biblook&amp;rsquo;s wealth, power, influence, and general ability to motivate something to get done (quite a lot, he&amp;rsquo;s a well paid consultant by Soul Banks and Witch Kings - d8)  World Die Represents: How much anyone else cares about his petty family/academic squabble and helping to resolve it (not much - d4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Biblook&amp;rsquo;s mother conclusively proves that her son&amp;rsquo;s work is entirely derivative of hers, major blow to prestige and livelihood  3-5: All of Biblook&amp;rsquo;s charges have brought extra scrutiny on his own materials, other sages are beginning to question their theoretical validity  6-8: Nothing changes  9-11: Biblook&amp;rsquo;s mother starts a smear campaign of her own, but it&amp;rsquo;s received as obviously desperate and in poor taste  12+: Biblook&amp;rsquo;s mother issues a public apology for her false claims, theories discredited, retires in disgrace  ### Design Notes &amp;amp; Considerations  So, as I mentioned above, this might be far too fiddly. The good news is that I think it ought to &amp;ldquo;fail gracefully&amp;rdquo; like Apocalypse World - if you ditch the usage dice, you lose out on the dynamic of things happening to the actors involved, but you still have different chances for success or failure. If you skip the different die sizes, you miss out on differentiating between rumors/jobs chances to resolve, but you still have a way to make living modifications. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t do any of it, you still have rumors to supply flavor and adventure hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of judgment calls to make here, but I hope that the rolls provide enough structure to the improvisation to keep things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-08-20-glog-instant-character-generator/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a character generator for Arnold&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;GLOG&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty jazzed about it. To use, simply set the toggles at the top to any inputs you want specified (or leave them random) and it&amp;rsquo;ll spit out a fully fledged character. Goes from levels 1 to 20. If you want to set Level, Class, or anything else (instead of random), you&amp;rsquo;ll need to make a copy on your own Drive or download it. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or open in its own tab &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsdfz7WGcVoFsd4KEGcYsyN8PFpExFddB1Qhtc7gPmw/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Milton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic methodology from Brendan S
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/2018/07/22/random-table-format-wars/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-modify-for-your-own-nefarious-purposes--first-learn-the-basics--1-read-brendans-explanation-of-the-underlying-method-herehttpwwwnecropraxiscom20180722random-table-format-wars-------next-create-your-own-copy-to-work-in--1-either-download-the-sheethttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1jsdfz7wgcvofsd4kegcysyn8pfpexfddb1qhtc7gpmwedituspsharingas-an-exel-file-or-else-make-a-copy-on-your-own-drive-so-that-you-can-edit-it&#34;&gt;How to Modify for Your Own Nefarious Purposes  &lt;strong&gt;First, Learn the Basics&lt;/strong&gt;  1. Read Brendan&amp;rsquo;s explanation of the underlying method &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/2018/07/22/random-table-format-wars/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Next, Create Your Own Copy to Work In&lt;/strong&gt;  1. Either download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsdfz7WGcVoFsd4KEGcYsyN8PFpExFddB1Qhtc7gPmw/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;sheet&lt;/a&gt;as an Exel file or else Make a Copy on your own Drive so that you can edit it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Modify An Existing Table&lt;/strong&gt;  Make sure you double check that the named range it&amp;rsquo;s a part of covers your changed entries and no empty space. All named ranges correspond to the title at the top of the range (except with real spaces instead of underscores)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Want to Add an Entirely New Table&lt;/strong&gt;  Make some space for it on the &amp;ldquo;Character&amp;rdquo; tab, then follow Brendan&amp;rsquo;s instructions above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Want to Add a New Race&lt;/strong&gt;  1. Create a new column  2. Use the top row to label it &amp;ldquo;[NAME] Race Template&amp;rdquo;  3. Put all racial information in cell immediately below that  4. Click on cell, then click the &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; menu and select &amp;ldquo;Named Ranges&amp;rdquo;  5. Select &amp;ldquo;Add a Range&amp;rdquo;, title it &amp;ldquo;[NAME]&lt;em&gt;Race_Template&amp;rdquo; - for example &amp;ldquo;Ratman_Race_Template&amp;rdquo;  6. Add the name of the race to the &amp;ldquo;Races&amp;rdquo; table. Make sure any spaces are underscores &amp;ldquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; - example: &amp;ldquo;Iron_Ghost_Men&amp;rdquo;  7. Check to make sure the &amp;ldquo;Races&amp;rdquo; named range includes your new name, modify it to include if needed  8. If the race modifies any stats (attributes, move, stealth, et cetera), you&amp;rsquo;ll have to modify the appropriate stat output to look for that race name in &amp;ldquo;Race_Output&amp;rdquo; with a conditional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Want to Add a New Class&lt;/strong&gt;  1. Create a new column  2. Use the top cell to label it &amp;ldquo;[Name] Class Templates&amp;rdquo;  3. In first through fourth cell, put Templates A, B, C, D for that class. I recommend you just put the names of the abilities, not a full explanation  4. In the fifth cell, put the class&amp;rsquo;s Prime Ability  5. In the sixth cell, put the class&amp;rsquo;s Starting Equipment  6. In the seventh cell, if the class allows for spellcasting, put &amp;ldquo;TRUE&amp;rdquo;  7. Highlight the cells you just filled and click on &amp;ldquo;Add a Range&amp;rdquo; (Data&amp;gt;Named Ranges) and name it &amp;ldquo;[NAME]_Class_Templates&amp;rdquo; - note the plural (for example &amp;ldquo;Fighter_Class_Templates&amp;rdquo;)  8. Add the class name to the Classes table, being sure to use underscores for any spaces, then check to make sure the &amp;ldquo;Classes&amp;rdquo; named range covers it  9. Under these seven cells, create a label for &amp;ldquo;[Class Name] Skills&amp;rdquo;  10. On the three rows below, write in the three background skill options for this class to begin with  11. Name the three skill range &amp;ldquo;[Class Name]_Skills&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Add a Spellcaster and Want to Add Their Spells&lt;/strong&gt;  1. Create a new column  2. Label it &amp;ldquo;[Class Name] Spells&amp;rdquo;  3. Add spells in cells 1-14  4. Select list of spells and &amp;ldquo;Add a Range&amp;rdquo; (Data&amp;gt;Named Ranges), naming it &amp;ldquo;[Class Name]_Spell_List&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes-and-assumptions&#34;&gt;Notes and Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; class is assumed to the one you have the most
templates in, and in the case of a tie, the one you had first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spells&amp;rdquo; are assumed to accumulate at one per level, and I have not
been able to figure out how to prevent duplicates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &amp;ldquo;effective levels&amp;rdquo; nonsense was my stop-gap way of making sure
that multi-class spellcasters don&amp;rsquo;t have oodles and oodles of spells
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it multiplies your level times the number of templates out of 4
you have in that class, and then assumes you have that many levels
worth of spells from the template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicate spells are quite possible - feel free to either re-roll or
assume duplicates are wasted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter the level, every character starts with first level gear -
you might want to adjust if you&amp;rsquo;re creating higher level characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters are assumed to have the minimum experience for the level
selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters get 3 skills at level 1 and then up to their level in
random skills at a random rank capped by level - if any skill comes
up a &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;, then no further skills are known&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Class Templates, rows 1-4 are what you get for each level of a
class you take, Row 5 is the Prime Ability for that class, and Row 6
is the class&amp;rsquo;s starting equipment, Row 7 specifies whether it&amp;rsquo;s a
spellcasting class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not yet calculate encumbrance or assign gear to slots,
sorry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other pain in the ass thing to modify will be the stats that are
upgraded by different class templates (Movement, Initiative,
Stealth, HP, Save) - removing classes won&amp;rsquo;t hurt the calculations,
but if you add new classes that modify stats, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to do that
manually. I could have done a stat line modification per template,
but there werent enough to make it seem worthwhile, and doing the
&amp;ldquo;every two templates&amp;rdquo; thing would have been challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and made Dog a race template and removed it from the
first level template for &amp;ldquo;Really Good Dog&amp;rdquo; and made &amp;ldquo;Really Good
Dog&amp;rdquo; the only playable class for that race. This does currently have
the effect of making Really Good Dog slightly more common than it
would be if it was random among the classes (more classes than
races), which I&amp;rsquo;m fine with. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to play a dog, just
reroll. Also, if you specify a class but go for a random Race, you
may end up with &amp;ldquo;Really Good Dog&amp;rdquo; instead of your specified class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most classes don&amp;rsquo;t have a prime ability because that&amp;rsquo;s something
Arnold came up with after putting out the Martial classes. I thought
about inventing my own, but decided to go &amp;ldquo;by the book&amp;rdquo; for now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The different wizards can only get spells 1-6 at level 1, 1-8 at
level 2, 1-10 at level 3, and 1-12 at level 4 and beyond. I
arbitrarily decided that level 19 and 20 characters have a shot at
the Legendary spells (13 and 14)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Creative Problem Solving Types in D&amp;D</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-08-09-creative-problem-solving-types-in-d/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-08-09-creative-problem-solving-types-in-d/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that a lot of the frameworks, methodologies, and concepts that come out of the business world are shallow nonsense. Anytime I hear the word &amp;ldquo;synergy&amp;rdquo;, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but hear in my head &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRuNxHqwazs&#34;&gt;SYNERGY&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share one that I believe provides a useful model for identifying and thinking about how different folks approach the creative process. Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through and applied that to RPGs for both GMs/Designers and for players. As always, questions and comments are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brief-overview-of-the-basadur-applied-creativity-framework--the-basadur-applied-creativity-frameworkhttpwwwbasadurcomwas-developed-by-dr-min-basadur-and-details-both-an-eight-step-creative-problem-solving-process-and-four-problem-solving-preference-types-were-going-to-be-talking-about-the-problem-solving-types-today-but-if-you-find-this-interesting-i-urge-you-to-check-out-the-website-to-learn-more-one-of-the-great-things-about-this-framework-and-one-that-makes-it-especially-relevant-to-rpgs-is-that-it-focuses-on-groupproblem-solving-where-many-how-to-be-creative-approaches-look-only-at-individual-creativity&#34;&gt;Brief Overview of the Basadur Applied Creativity Framework  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.basadur.com/&#34;&gt;Basadur Applied Creativity Framework&lt;/a&gt; was developed by Dr. Min Basadur and details both an eight-step creative problem solving process and four problem-solving preference types. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about the problem-solving types today, but if you find this interesting, I urge you to check out the website to learn more. One of the great things about this framework, and one that makes it especially relevant to RPGs, is that it focuses on &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; problem solving, where many &amp;ldquo;how to be creative&amp;rdquo; approaches look only at individual creativity. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-framework-for-the-profiles--first-off-a-caveat-these-profiles-are-not-personality-types-none-of-them-is-better-than-the-others-and-no-one-is-confined-to-only-one-everyone-can-and-does-use-each-of-the-four-types-but-almost-everybody-has-a-strong-preference-for-one-type-and-finds-that-piece-of-problem-solvingcreativity-easier-than-others&#34;&gt;The Framework for the Profiles  First off, a caveat: these profiles are not &amp;ldquo;personality types&amp;rdquo;, none of them is better than the others, and no one is confined to only one. Everyone can and does use each of the four types, but almost everybody has a strong preference for one type and finds that piece of problem-solving/creativity easier than others.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is built on two axes: Generate-Evaluate and Action-Knowledge. &amp;ldquo;Generate&amp;rdquo; refers to folks&amp;rsquo; preference for coming up with ideas - think &amp;ldquo;brainstorming&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Evaluate&amp;rdquo; refers to looking at ideas and judging them against criteria - think looking at the long list of things brainstormed and picking the good ones. &amp;ldquo;Action&amp;rdquo; describes a preference for &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; something like writing, manipulating, experimenting, moving to learn about the challenge, where &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; refers to a preference for research, abstract thinking, and analysis. Put the two together and folks fall into one of the quadrants pictured above and described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;applying-the-profiles-to-rpgs--one-benefit-this-approach-has-compared-to-some-player-types-stuff-is-that-its-empirically-backed-another-is-that-it-profitably-suggests-how-the-types-can-work-together-to-make-something-better-together-zak-and-others-have-already-pointed-out-how-great-rpgs-can-be-for-allowing-multiple-levels-of-engagementhttpdndwithpornstarsblogspotcom201001how-much-do-you-want-to-be-wizard_15html-but-this-framework-goes-in-a-slightly-different-direction-by-talking-not-about-engagement-per-se-but-rather-what-pieces-of-problems-are-rather-to-make-certain-folks-sit-up-and-take-notice-each-of-the-profiles-is-listed-with-what-they-find-easyenjoyable-along-with-some-stuff-that-they-might-find-challenging-ill-note-again-that-you-can-train-yourself-to-get-over-these-challenges&#34;&gt;Applying the Profiles to RPGs  One benefit this approach has compared to some &amp;ldquo;player types&amp;rdquo; stuff is that it&amp;rsquo;s empirically backed. Another is that it profitably suggests how the types can &lt;em&gt;work together to make something better together&lt;/em&gt;. Zak and others have already pointed out how great RPGs can be for &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/01/how-much-do-you-want-to-be-wizard_15.html&#34;&gt;allowing multiple levels of engagement&lt;/a&gt;, but this framework goes in a slightly different direction by talking not about engagement per-se, but rather what pieces of problems are rather to make certain folks sit up and take notice. Each of the profiles is listed with what they find easy/enjoyable, along with some stuff that they might find challenging. I&amp;rsquo;ll note again that you can train yourself to get over these challenges.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note, my analysis here assumes a fairly OSR-ish &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html&#34;&gt;challenge-based&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; approach to play, where actual problem-solving will be a big part of the game. For games with a more narrative/emotional bent, your mileage may vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve included some names and links to folks who I think might lean towards these styles, but this may vary for the same person when they&amp;rsquo;re a player versus a GM, and they are based on nothing but my own reading blogs, play reports, and occasional shared online sessions. Pure speculation on my part. Note &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; that any of the challenges given for the profiles aren&amp;rsquo;t being imputed to the examples I name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generator&lt;/strong&gt;   Generators are the people who looked at 1d100 tables and asked &amp;ldquo;why not 1d1000?&amp;rdquo; Having a preference for Action and Generation (surprise), these folks like to come up with any and every possible idea related to the matter at hand. Or maybe not related. Their problem is not coming up with stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;stopping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a GM/Designer/Blogger&lt;/em&gt;: Astounding new material, often with a lot of variation. Stuff where you ask yourself &amp;ldquo;how did they come up with that?&amp;rdquo; Perhaps some trouble following through with getting those astounding ideas into a finished form because they found something else new and awesome that they had to get out of their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Player&lt;/em&gt;: A million schemes. &amp;ldquo;Oh wait, but we could also. . .&amp;rdquo; Delights in the openness and possibility of a whole imaginary world where they could try something. Deeply torn between going to Voivoidja, Yoon-Suin, or the Swordfish Isles. Once they get there, will have an endless font of ways to engage with the place. Might have some trouble settling on just one, and might respond to attempts by the rest of the group to settle on something and get on with it with &amp;ldquo;oh, wait, but what about [something totally new to consider].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Folks I Suspect Might Lean This Way&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://middenmurk.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Tom Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ben L.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Scrap Princess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conceptualizer&lt;/strong&gt;   Preferring to generate ideas through analytical thought and abstract thinking, conceptualizers tend to enjoy taking one hazily defined thought and then dig into it and find every nook and cranny of that idea. &amp;ldquo;What if the dungeon really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a functioning ecology?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What would a society look like where everyone was psychic?&amp;rdquo; These folks often have whiteboards or other ways to easily visualize/mind-map stuff always at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a GM/Designer/Blogger&lt;/em&gt;: Deeply interesting stuff that starts from a fairly simple premise. Finding the bizarro logic that underlies something seemingly gonzo. Picking something they know they like and figuring out what makes it tick. Scenarios that present lots of open-ended challenge just from taking the implications of something seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Player&lt;/em&gt;: Once a scheme/course of action has been picked, figuring out all of the angles, every contingency that might work. Thinking about all the ways we might break into the castle to get to the archpriest. Asking the GM about the logic that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be behind the detail they were given. May have some tendency toward completionism, wanting to see every room, find every secret, learn every nuance. Might have some trouble looking at the &lt;em&gt;effectiveness&lt;/em&gt; of potential plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Folks I Suspect Might Lean This Way&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Zak S.&lt;/a&gt; (with strong Generator leanings?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick Stuart&lt;/a&gt; (as a Blogger/Designer), &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Arnold Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;David McGrogan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizer&lt;/strong&gt;   Here we move over from the &amp;ldquo;generator&amp;rdquo; types to the &amp;ldquo;evaluator&amp;rdquo; types. Optimizers find it much easier to look at an existing set of ideas/thoughts/evidence and group them, rank them, or cut them. Editors rather than writers. Like conceptualizers, they prefer to work with research and abstract thinking, but instead of figuring out &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; nuance of a certain concept, they want to find the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a GM/Designer/Blogger&lt;/em&gt;: Likely a lot of thoughtful, nuanced discussion on mechanics, as those are easy to test and tweak and make &amp;ldquo;better.&amp;rdquo; Might take published content and carefully curate/hack it to fit into their conceptually-consistent world. Possibly write insightful and detailed reviews, with lots of material on how it could have been better. Might find it challenging to come up with mind-blowingly original stuff from scratch. Might get lost trying to make something &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; before putting it into their game/getting it published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Player&lt;/em&gt;: Will lovingly plan the heist. When the Generator says we could kidnap the archpriest, rip off the brewers&amp;rsquo; guild, sail to the new world, or become famous artists, and the Conceptualizer finds 10 different ways into the archpriest&amp;rsquo;s castle, the Optimizer looks at them and goes &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s do this one. And here&amp;rsquo;s how. We know the guards are on this schedule, the lighting is like this. . .&amp;rdquo; Will come up with and share the best tactics against certain foes with the party. Will find the most lucrative ways to spend treasure. Might tend toward min/maxing. Might get frustrated with non-&amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; decisions by fellow adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Folks I Suspect Might Lean This Way&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://thealexandrian.net/&#34;&gt;Jason Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/&#34;&gt;Brendan S&lt;/a&gt;, Myself, &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Gus L&lt;/a&gt;(?), &lt;a href=&#34;https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Anne Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (but maybe more conceptualizer?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementer&lt;/strong&gt;   Finally, we have the people that wonder why can&amp;rsquo;t we just get the damn thing done. Implementers prefer to evaluate by way of more tangible action - try it, see what happens, adjust, try it again. Doers. Often the driving force that keeps the other three types from getting lost in their particular preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a GM/Designer/Blogger&lt;/em&gt;: Shut up and let&amp;rsquo;s play! Might make heavy use of published modules or settings. Might not worry too much about the aesthetic perfection or coherency of their world and more about &lt;em&gt;but does it affect play&lt;/em&gt;? Will build tools ruthlessly whittled down to what is needed at the table. More likely to create interesting content based on giving the players buttons to push than to flesh out the fictional world in great detail. Might find it challenging to make a rich, vivid setting. Might not give some players the chance to plan and scheme deeply that they&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There might not be that many Implementer bloggers, as blogging is inherently kind of navel-gazey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Player&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Fuck this, I stab the guy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I pull the lever.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Great, yeah, what was the last thing you said? The tomb? Yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s go rob that, it&amp;rsquo;ll be awesome.&amp;rdquo; This style of play can sometimes get a bad rap, but it &lt;em&gt;makes the game happen&lt;/em&gt;. In a world of buttons to push, levers to pull, and structures to topple, the Implementer player will make the chaos that gives all the other types interesting situations to think about and chew on. Likely less concerned with succeeding the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way as with &lt;em&gt;getting to the challenge so we can beat it&lt;/em&gt;. Might cause some heartburn to other problem-solving types by mucking up their assumptions. Might bite off more than they or the party can chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Folks I Suspect Might Lean This Way&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick Young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick Stuart&lt;/a&gt; (as a player), &lt;a href=&#34;http://rememberdismove.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Dunkey Halton&lt;/a&gt;(?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://jrients.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Jeff Rients&lt;/a&gt; (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together--the-beauty-of-this-framework-is-that-to-most-effectively-solve-problems-you-need-to-do-all-of-the-things-that-the-different-types-find-easyenjoyable-some-folks-find-it-easier-to-switch-between-one-mode-and-another-but-if-you-have-a-group-where-different-people-excel-at-different-parts-of-the-problem-solving-process-and-they-know-about-it-you-can-start-consciously-taking-advantage-of-it-right-then-alice-generator-will-come-up-with-ten-possible-schemes-bob-conceptualizer-will-then-flesh-out-the-details-on-what-we-all-think-the-top-3-are-carolyn-optimizer-will-take-the-one-we-pick-out-of-those-and-streamline-it-and-daryl-implementer-will-kick-our-asses-into-gear-with-getting-it-done-theres-more-to-the-problem-solving-method-applied-creativity-teaches-but-i-can-write-about-that-another-time-if-anybodys-interested&#34;&gt;Putting It All Together  The beauty of this framework is that to most effectively solve problems, you need to do all of the things that the different types find easy/enjoyable. Some folks find it easier to switch between one mode and another, but if you have a group where different people excel at different parts of the problem-solving process, and they know about it,  you can start consciously taking advantage of it: &amp;ldquo;Right then, Alice [Generator] will come up with ten possible schemes, Bob [Conceptualizer] will then flesh out the details on what we all think the top 3 are, Carolyn [Optimizer] will take the one we pick out of those and streamline it, and Daryl [Implementer] will kick our asses into gear with getting it done.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s more to the problem-solving method Applied Creativity teaches, but I can write about that another time if anybody&amp;rsquo;s interested.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a thing that makes monsters. I&amp;rsquo;m terribly pleased with it right now, but let me know what you think. If the embed below is giving you weird formatting (on a phone or tablet, say), or if you just want to mess with it, check out the sheet &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IPuObMhs2Tajf79ewc5tUKsfOrwG0fCdLS_T62U7ZU/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Brendan&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/2018/07/22/random-table-format-wars/&#34;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt; to build it in Google Sheets. Every time you refresh this page, you should get a new result. If you open it up as a sheet, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a new result whenever you refresh the page. If you make a copy for yourself that you can edit, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a new result whenever you make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thewingless.com/forge/forge.htm&#34;&gt;Monster Forge&lt;/a&gt; is awesome, but still puts most of the heavy lifting on me. So I started looking through various monster manuals to get ideas. As I took notes, it struck me that I could decompose what I found cool about monsters that caught my attention into elements of some kind, then I&amp;rsquo;d be able to create a generator. So I switched my notes over to excel. I arbitrarily picked six &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; I had to write down about each monster and purposely did not create categories until after I had gone through all the monsters in my list. Then I took each line item and copy/pasted it into a column if I felt like they &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://generalassemb.ly/design/user-experience-design/affinity-mapping&#34;&gt;went together&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Once everything had a home, I smashed some columns together, removed others, and ended up labeling each of them. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around here I recalled David McGrogan&amp;rsquo;s epic &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2014/05/housekeeping.html&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Read the 2E Monstrous Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; thread and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lulu.com/shop/patrick-stuart-and-scrap-princess/fire-on-the-velvet-horizon/paperback/product-23550253.html&#34;&gt;Fire on the Velvet Horizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Scrap&lt;/a&gt;. Both make much of &amp;ldquo;the sages&amp;rdquo; that tell us things in monster manuals and how it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird but very effective way to write about stuff in a book that is simultaneously giving you the god-like &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; of the world but also trying to inspire you. So I figured that I&amp;rsquo;d arrange the generator into a natural language sentence flavored as if a sage were telling you about this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this approach was that it let me hit a sweet spot between providing enough concrete detail to get your imagination going but also enough vagueness that it&amp;rsquo;s psychologically easier to ignore or massage any outright contradictory or uncool stuff that happens to come up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted this to be fairly usable, though, so after I got the natural language bit worked out, I went back and added some stats. I had grand ideas about tying these into all of the abilities and behaviors, but a) that&amp;rsquo;s not all that helpful, as thinking up stats once you have the idea isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard, and b) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do it at all cleanly. So, what we ended up with was size affecting HD and AC, and whether some kind of humanoid came up in the type putting a lower limit on intelligence and animals shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get weapons as attack types, but other than that, the stats are randomly determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;design-notes&#34;&gt;Design Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core of the description is one or sometimes two monster or
animal base types - I did this to maximize the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2009/10/imaginable-monsters-sci-fi-monsters-etc.html?zx=14c3c88963fb2fde&#34;&gt;imaginability&lt;/a&gt;,
but also because I wanted something a little more naturalistic than
James Raggi&amp;rsquo;s (excellent, but super random) &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/58916/Random-Esoteric-Creature-Generator-for-Classic-Fantasy-RolePlaying-Games-and-their-Modern-Simulacra&#34;&gt;Random Esoteric
Creature
Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s not as comprehensive as it might be, because my input
monsters were all ones that I felt would fit in Fellhold, which is
pretty aesthetically restricted compared to &amp;ldquo;kitchen sink&amp;rdquo; D&amp;amp;D - I
ended up adding a few things in that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; in
Fellhold, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to capture all of D&amp;amp;D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That being said, it should be pretty easy to adapt this to your own
game world by changing up which origins, animal types, abilities,
behaviors, and so forth are in the random tables - feel free to
contact me if any of the formulas are unclear for customizing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the entries (size, intelligence, combat stats) have
normal(ish) distributions, so you&amp;rsquo;re a little less likely to get
totally gonzo stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the stats, I normalized them around a B/X Grizzly Bear,
following Jack Shear&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://talesofthegrotesqueanddungeonesque.blogspot.com/2016/08/just-use-bears.html&#34;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt;,
so you might need to beef up a solo monster for 5E or higher levels,
or reduce stats if you&amp;rsquo;re going for an organized and intelligent
monster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I totally pulled the No. Appearing numbers out of my hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used descending AC cos that&amp;rsquo;s how I roll - I figure we&amp;rsquo;re all used
to converting back and forth by now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the monsters that come out will be somewhat unpleasant and
hostile, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a great generator for coming up with more
sympathetic or neutral creatures. If you want that sort of thing,
just ignore the motivations/internal state and maybe the behavior
and come up with your own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything of human level intelligence or more is more likely to have
weapons listed as attacks than animal-type attacks, which may give
some weird results - as with everything else, ignore if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>OSR Classes: The Mastermind and the Rook</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-07-18-osr-classes-mastermind-and-rook/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:08:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2018-07-18-osr-classes-mastermind-and-rook/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-07-18-osr-classes-mastermind-and-rook/ -&lt;p&gt;After my last post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2018/07/flexible-reaction-rolls.html&#34;&gt;Flexible Reaction Rolls&lt;/a&gt;, I found myself thinking about how to build Character Classes that fit with the schemey, urban style of play I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for with Fellhold. The trouble for me until now was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of ways to get that stuff without impinging on the Old School playstyle I enjoy. What cracked it for me was turning the Reaction Roll into a mechanic with more knobs to play with. From there I also realized that Advantage/Disadvantage opened up a lot of new possibilities, and so I built one class on each of those realizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V0v1CmEJWQk/W09SgXeKcPI/AAAAAAAAG80/cDAOvhNljqsyNz_Hr5fn2njlNZvHDxvhQCLcBGAs/s1600/johnhannibalsmith.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V0v1CmEJWQk/W09SgXeKcPI/AAAAAAAAG80/cDAOvhNljqsyNz_Hr5fn2njlNZvHDxvhQCLcBGAs/s320/johnhannibalsmith.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Mastermind&lt;/strong&gt; is the classic brains behind the operation. It struck me that advantage/disadvantage are a pretty great way to model careful planning without having to go full-on storygame metagame city. Their first level ability &lt;em&gt;Forethought&lt;/em&gt; can potentially be quite powerful, but requires clever thinking and skill on the player&amp;rsquo;s part. Their final ability (&amp;ldquo;I Love It When A Plan Comes Together&amp;rdquo;) &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get awfully close to the storygamey end of things, and might in reality just be &amp;ldquo;use in case of boss fight&amp;rdquo; - but I&amp;rsquo;ll test it. The class also serves as a secondary adventure hook generator through the extra contacts, their starting gear, and their second level class ability (&amp;ldquo;A Little Bird Told Me&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JJ_pVBuIi4E/W09S0CswnBI/AAAAAAAAG88/1zmU_pQ4h5c_UM0jU5rrowlssU0n9O-ZwCLcBGAs/s1600/Dirk-benedict-the-a-team.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JJ_pVBuIi4E/W09S0CswnBI/AAAAAAAAG88/1zmU_pQ4h5c_UM0jU5rrowlssU0n9O-ZwCLcBGAs/s320/Dirk-benedict-the-a-team.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Rook&lt;/strong&gt; is &amp;ldquo;the face&amp;rdquo; - hyper-sociable, built around understanding and tweaking NPC reactions. Getting +1 to reaction rolls per two templates is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; (especially when combined with the class features) and kind of guarantees this character will speak for the party all the time - I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided if that means I need to remove it or if that&amp;rsquo;s awesome. This class pretty much has super powers in one area that has very little to do with fighting, which right now seems pretty cool. Someone with 4 levels in Rook becomes a best-friend factory and basically gives the party an off-switch for combat with anybody even possibly open to parley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, if you&amp;rsquo;re following the classic trinity of group dynamics, I figure PCs will collectively provide the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYtjpIwamos&#34;&gt;wild card&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting equipment is stingier than in &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-index.html&#34;&gt;Skerples&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; classes, but that&amp;rsquo;s because I plan on building them into my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2018/07/money-equipment-in-fellhold.html&#34;&gt;Equipment Tables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-classing 2/2 with these two classes might be terrifyingly powerful in social situations, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that, given the usual lack of options for that sort of thing in OSR classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note on Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;   If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;Arnold K&amp;rsquo;s GLOG&lt;/a&gt; is his homebrew/Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Stone, and I rather like it. See the link if the format below doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not use this most excellent modification, fear not! The classes below have a &amp;ldquo;base class&amp;rdquo; - use this for XP, HD, Saves, Attack Bonus, gear restrictions, and so on. As for the class abilities, you have a few options:   - Follow the same steep, ultimately low power curve of the GLOG and give one template per level up to 4   - For a more spaced out progression that assumes 10th level is about as high as you go, give the prime ability at level 1 and then a template every odd level (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)   - Look at the templates and eyeball when to give them to the character to match the power level of your other classes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough intro, here are the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastermind  Clever folks who think ahead and help their team get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Base Class: Thief)  Prime Ability: Meddlesome  Per Template: +1 Willpower Save, +1 Contact  Starting Equipment: Disguise Kit, Incriminating Letter  A Forethought  B A Little Bird Told Me  C True Sight  D I Love It When a Plan Comes Together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Features  MEDDLESOME  Once per day, you may give another character (PC or NPC) advice. If they follow it, you may decide to give them either &lt;em&gt;Advantage&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/em&gt; on one roll related to the advice. To give &lt;em&gt;Advantage&lt;/em&gt;, the advice must be sound and something that either you or your character know enough about to advise on. To give &lt;em&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/em&gt;, they must believe it to be good, but there must be something wrong with it (convincing bullshit counts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORETHOUGHT  Choose one or more of the following: activity, place, being, conditions. For each that you specify, gain one use of &lt;em&gt;Advantage&lt;/em&gt; on rolls that meet all of the criteria. For example, if you said “Hand to hand fighting in an alley with humans while its raining”, you would get advantage on four rolls involving hand-to-hand fighting with humans in an alley in the rain. The GM may rule that any of the criteria are too broad and require more specificity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME  Once per week, choose one: 1) Name a known NPC and the GM will tell you one true secret about them, which might be boring,  2) Learn a juicy rumor about a previously unknown NPC - might be true, might not, and the identity might be unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRUE SIGHT  As long as you can see their face, you always know when someone is lying to you - not necessarily about what &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;, just that there is untruth there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER  Once per adventure or dungeon, you can declare that you’ve been planning for this very situation all along. Everyone in the group gets advantage on every roll this round. Gain an extra round of this if you come up with an especially convincing narrative of how you influenced prior actions to lead to this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rook  Affable folks that know how to say just what others want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Base Class Thief, or Bard if You Have It)   Prime Ability: Read Folks  Per Template: +1 to Reaction Rolls for every &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; templates, rounded down, +1 Contact  Starting Equipment: Flattering Clothes, Disguise Kit, Invitation to a Shindig  A Well Read  B Likable  C Tempting  D Charming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Features  READ FOLKS  You have an uncanny knack for seeing what folks are thinking and feeling. Once per a meeting, you can ask the GM what the NPC die will be on the next reaction roll if you take a certain approach, make a given argument, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WELL READ  You know lots of interesting things to talk about. Any time you make a knowledge-based test in a social situation, you count as having the skill at rank 3. Note that you only know enough to talk &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; these things, not to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything with them. You could have a wonderful conversation about quadratic equations with a mathematician, but you could not then plot ballistic parabola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIKABLE  When the GM makes a reaction roll where you are the spokesman, your PC die will be one step higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEMPTING  If you put the moves on someone amenable to your advances, and a reaction roll comes up middling or better, they are very attracted to you, which will color their reactions to you (improved reaction rolls, more willing to hear you out, and so forth). Note that it does not guarantee they will &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; you, just want you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHARMING  Once per week, you can declare you are laying the charm on thick before a reaction roll is rolled. If the roll comes up pretty good or better, they are affected as &lt;em&gt;Charm Person&lt;/em&gt;. If after a week you haven’t done anything to push them away or piss them off, the friendship becomes genuine. Add them as a contact.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-07-16-flexible-reaction-rolls/ -&lt;p&gt;Reaction rolls are one of my very favorite set of rules. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and help me to come up with more interesting stuff than I might on my own. I use them as a general purpose social sub-system, though not nearly to the same extent as &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Courtney Campbell&lt;/a&gt; in his excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/courtney-campbell/on-the-non-player-character/ebook/product-21094127.html&#34;&gt;On the Non-Player Character&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, I use them more as an oracle when I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how the NPCs would react. With Fellhold being an urban game, social interaction is even more of a big deal than I like for it to be in dungeon or wilderness games, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about them a lot recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was while trying to figure out how best to track PC&amp;rsquo;s reputations with different factions that I hit on the core idea below: the PC(s) and the NPC(s) each &amp;ldquo;bring&amp;rdquo; a die to the roll. A couple years back, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/&#34;&gt;Logan Knight&lt;/a&gt; suggested I move reaction rolls up and down die steps (so, say, 2d4, 1d4+1d6, 2d6, 1d6+1d8, and so forth). Then the other week I read Mateo Diaz&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/2018/04/this-isnt-even-my-final-form.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced me to the idea of having different sources for the two dice. What you see below is what I came up with based on all that. As always, let me know anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work or could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction Rolls  Reaction rolls are hugely useful for an urban game, given the high number of social interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context is very important for reaction rolls in Fellhold, and you will need to use some judgement in interpreting rolls. Guests at a dinner party are much less likely to attack on sight than a wild troll in a dungeon. The table below gives some guidance for common situations.  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Roll&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Dungeon&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Merchant&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Social&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;General&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; 2 or less &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Attack &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Swindle &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Mean &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Worst Possible &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; 3-5 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Wary &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Tightfisted &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Rude &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Pretty Bad &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; 6-8 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Willing to Deal &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Fair &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Polite &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Middling &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; 9-11 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Interested &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Helpful &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Friendly &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Pretty Good &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; 12+ &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Friendly &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Generous &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Best Friends! &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Best Possible &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-Sided Reaction Rolls  All reaction rolls are made with two dice - d6s by default. Each side brings one die to the roll. The die for the player character(s) will be based on their demeanor and approach, while the die for the NPC(s) will be based on their disposition and prejudices, including how they feel about the factions the PCs belong to. Adjust the roll using the spokesman’s CHA modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game master determines both die sizes, but the PC die should be based on what steps the PCs are or aren’t taking to make a certain sort of impression - acting threatening or friendly? Somewhere they belong or not? Well dressed or filthy? Asking clarifying questions is a good idea here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Steps for Reaction Dice  For both sides of the reaction roll, dice can step up or down from a d4 (the worst) to d12 (the best). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NPC’s die size is up to the game master’s discretion, but some common situations are covered below.  From a hostile faction: down one step  From a friendly faction: up one step  From a faction you belong to: up two steps  In hostile turf: down one step  On friendly turf: up one step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple Reaction Rolls  Reaction rolls are helpful any time you need to gauge how an NPC feels about something, not just when first meeting the PCs, so some interactions will have multiple rolls. In such interactions, you may adjust one or both of the dice depending on how the encounter is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: the PCs meet a group of Pickers deep underground, you initially roll 2d6 because neither group is doing anything particularly helpful or harming and you get a 7. The Pickers begin speaking with the PC group, who try to overawe them with talk of how fierce they are. Pickers aren’t much impressed by this kind of thing, so when the PCs demand the Pickers hand over 50% of what they’ve found so far, you adjust the PC die down to a d4 and roll to see what they think of the offer, getting a 10, amazingly. The Pickers Laugh and say no way, but they like the stones on these guys. For further interaction, you bump it back up to 2d6.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Player Character Races in Fellhold</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-07-11-player-character-races-in-fellhold/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 17:30:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2018-07-11-player-character-races-in-fellhold/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-07-11-player-character-races-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put together an eclectic set of PC races for my Fellhold setting, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to follow Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/12/designing-races.html&#34;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; to avoid passive modifiers that lead to builds, but man, after decades of that being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; way races get distinguished, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get around.  Let me know what you think, and especially if you see anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work. All art by the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://lexiconmegatherium.tumblr.com/tagged/erickochart&#34;&gt;Eric Koch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crabmen were inspired by
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144820/YoonSuin?&#34;&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
but I&amp;rsquo;ve taken them in a very different direction. Artsy-fartsy
merchants and intelligentsia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiends are like the Kami in &lt;em&gt;Princess Monoke&lt;/em&gt;, but they want your
soul. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half Dwarves are the descendants of humans and dwarves
interbreeding, and take on traits that you might find associated
with dwarves or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/06/this-is-what-halfling-cities-are-like.html?zx=650a9612c5cd7759&#34;&gt;halflings&lt;/a&gt;
in other settings. Most of them are bitter about their lost glory
and are in the mafia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are humans, but in this cosmopolitan city, they&amp;rsquo;re the most
adept at getting along with all the strange shit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ratmen are basically
&lt;a href=&#34;http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Skaven&#34;&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;, but instead
of being riven by internal factionalism and backbiting, they have
the strongest mono-culture in town, are matriarchal, and happen to
be the best cooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tieflings have fiend blood. Yes, I need to find a name that isn&amp;rsquo;t
WOTC copyright. Everybody thinks they&amp;rsquo;re sexy and clever and
untrustworthy, but they mostly roll their eyes at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided whether Draugr (full or partial undead from
selling parts of your soul) should be a PC race or something that
can just happen to PCs if they sell bits of their souls - right now
I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards the latter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pc-races-in-fellhold&#34;&gt;PC Races in Fellhold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Master Note  The races presented below are the default for Fellhold. Depending on how you place Fellhold in the world, you may have some changes. You might allow other races not included here or restrict some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, if you want to stress the weirdness of Fellhold, start out with only human PCs and let players choose new races as they’re meaningfully found in play. Crabmen just don’t feel that weird if your buddy sitting next to you is one of them. On the other hand, if you want to stress the cosmopolitan, urban feel of Fellhold, allow all of the races below (or even more) - this will give a feeling that Crabmen are just another sort of folk you’re likely to run into daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Rules  Each race below includes a brief, general description of the race and its characteristics along with any special boons or banes that come with being a member of that race. Note also that race will be a factor in some other areas of the game not covered here, such as the ability to progress in, or even join, some of the factions of the city, the sorts of stereotypes NPCs will hold about you, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player Character Race Descriptions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o46kRdO5ahc/W0afn1uOkiI/AAAAAAAAG70/pAkMtd2zIT8u2nKl35PtYUiXidUxrl4pwCLcBGAs/s1600/CrabMan_merchant_concept01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o46kRdO5ahc/W0afn1uOkiI/AAAAAAAAG70/pAkMtd2zIT8u2nKl35PtYUiXidUxrl4pwCLcBGAs/s320/CrabMan_merchant_concept01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crabmen  Despite their large, hulking appearance and natural armor, crabmen tend towards philosophical and artistic temperaments. They make up a large number of the sages of the city, and of course their enormously wealthy Merchant Houses are known to all. Generally, crabmen are extremely cooperative with members of their own family, especially their own birthing group, and have a hard time helping out or even caring about anyone outside of it. Many crabmen have gotten around this through fairly widespread “adoption” of friends and business partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Crabmen’s natural exo-skeleton means that their unarmored AC is 2 better than a human’s. Armor is much harder to make for crabmen, as it is not much in demand by them and must be made larger, so any armor costs 2x the normal cost. Their reactions to anyone not in their “family” will tend towards apathy and ignoring them. Crabmen receive advantage on any rolls related to intellectual or artistic pursuits besides magic (study, crafting, and so forth). Their large size and rigid bodies means that they will have difficulty squeezing into some tight spaces, or in situations that require great flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mskh-B-khk0/W0af3Jy6fDI/AAAAAAAAG74/sVxR1JACLww8XFvgfhmNMfo8tFqAza9BwCLcBGAs/s1600/Demon_concept02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mskh-B-khk0/W0af3Jy6fDI/AAAAAAAAG74/sVxR1JACLww8XFvgfhmNMfo8tFqAza9BwCLcBGAs/s320/Demon_concept02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiends  Fiends are the warped and wicked results of the godsdeath. They vary greatly in both power and form from minor animalistic sprites of rocks and saplings to mighty humanoid powers worshiped as gods. A player character fiend is far more powerful than many of these minor beings, but is still pretty far down the ladder. Fiends thrive on souls and worship, and most turn all of their doing towards those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Every fiend must have a stead, a place or thing that it is bound to. The fiend cannot move farther away from it than its level in miles (or level in districts, if more useful). Steads can be carried with fiends of the PC’s size and power, but if a  stead is destroyed, the fiend truly dies. If otherwise killed, the fiend will reform at its stead in 1d4 urbancrawl turns (weeks). If a fiend swears an oath or signs a contract, it cannot willingly break that deal (but of course, the word of the deal, not necessarily the spirit). Fiends can also be summoned, compelled, and bound as NPC fiends. Fiends must have a Use Name, Greater Name, and True Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IHgsKgoLHFA/W0agABbd9ZI/AAAAAAAAG8A/yVverhf6K88bgIe5rNth6ACng1QhYsKmACLcBGAs/s1600/Untitled_Artwork%2B%25283%2529.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IHgsKgoLHFA/W0agABbd9ZI/AAAAAAAAG8A/yVverhf6K88bgIe5rNth6ACng1QhYsKmACLcBGAs/s320/Untitled_Artwork%2B%25283%2529.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half Dwarves  Half Dwarves are the mixed descendants of the original dwarf settlers of Fellhold and humans. They have become a stable race of their own, but still stubbornly refer to themselves as true dwarves, claiming the inheritance of the Dwarven Great Kingdom as theirs by right. Their society is organized by huge extended families, run by Forefathers and Foremothers, the Fathers and Mothers of member families, and so on. Formerly the masters of trade and craft in the city, their wealth has been surpassed by the Crabmen, and they are eternally bitter for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Half Dwarves are extremely hardy and gain advantage on any and all saves against poison, drugs, or disease and ignore their first pip of exhaustion in a day. Their reactions to crabmen will be generally negative, unless they know the person well and have come to like them. Their small size means both that they can more easily slip into tight spaces, but also that large foes can more easily knock them down, pick them up, or otherwise use brute force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C5xod-R-hEQ/W0agFhB_vmI/AAAAAAAAG8E/2YlDka4jCsgq5GTxq0DO9tpB4iRQ3i5AwCLcBGAs/s1600/Untitled_Artwork%2B%25289%2529.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C5xod-R-hEQ/W0agFhB_vmI/AAAAAAAAG8E/2YlDka4jCsgq5GTxq0DO9tpB4iRQ3i5AwCLcBGAs/s320/Untitled_Artwork%2B%25289%2529.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans  Humans are both the most numerous race within Fellhold and the least represented in its most powerful groups, unless you include the undead Witch Kings as still being “human”.  Descended from every culture ever conquered by the Dwarves or the Witch Kings, humans are a varied lot made up of many groups, each with their own distinct look, belief, and way of living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Humans by need have come to understand and live with wildly different groups of people of every race, and so reaction rolls with new or otherwise unknown people will always be one step higher when dealing with a human. Humans are also a remarkably stubborn race, and so may re-roll one failed saving throw to avoid death once per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nCAnEplcUr0/W0agLjbHDWI/AAAAAAAAG8I/n18Fg7pkx8cbV7MF3rJLoFwMv-Q4hSSmgCLcBGAs/s1600/Ratman_thief.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nCAnEplcUr0/W0agLjbHDWI/AAAAAAAAG8I/n18Fg7pkx8cbV7MF3rJLoFwMv-Q4hSSmgCLcBGAs/s320/Ratman_thief.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratmen  Ratmen are one of the most insular races, living as one unified clan under the rule of their Queen and their Fiend God. Despite being seen as sneaky and not to be trusted by most other races, they are also regarded as the finest cooks in all of Fellhold, and most people don’t believe the rumors that they don’t care too much what or who goes into the cookpot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Unless a player chooses otherwise, all Ratmen are presumed to belong to the Ratmen Clan faction to begin with. Ratmen are especially lithe and stealthy, and so receive advantage on any rolls where they are attempting to sneak. Their AC against ranged weapons is improved by one due to their keen senses and quick wits. Any other race besides fiends will have their reaction rolls reduced by one step unless they know the ratman from before. Their small size also means that their maximum hit points are one lower per hit die than normal (minimum of 1). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NaRgHFnyuM4/W0agb2QJg8I/AAAAAAAAG8Y/NGNswPydpBQO3ui_PwDdJYZ94_-ZnX4cwCLcBGAs/s1600/Env_concept01_bad.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NaRgHFnyuM4/W0agb2QJg8I/AAAAAAAAG8Y/NGNswPydpBQO3ui_PwDdJYZ94_-ZnX4cwCLcBGAs/s320/Env_concept01_bad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tieflings  The descendants of the other races with the addition of fiend blood, tieflings are not quite a distinct society of their own, but instead largely integrate themselves into others, usually that of their mortal kin. That being said, they have some ties to one another, and others view them as a distinct group. They are regarded as sexy, clever, untrustworthy, and ambitious, but they tend to roll their eyes at this. How much of their look they get from their fiendish forebearers varies widely, with some having nubby little horns under their hair or a small tail, while others could pass for fiends themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIAL  Tieflings’ fiendish blood makes them resistant to magic, so they gain advantage on any saves against magic. Their mysterious allure also allows them, once per week, to have an immediate Charm Person effect on anyone who makes a neutral or better reaction roll toward them. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to the tiefling’s level, but they might actually become your friend in the meantime. Also due to their fiendish blood, if a Tiefling’s true name is used in making a deal or contract, they cannot willingly violate that deal. Also, having fiendish blood themselves, they cannot believe strongly enough in another fiend to receive any benefits from magic gained by worship of fiends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Money &amp; Equipment in Fellhold</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-07-10-money-equipment-in-fellhold/</link>

        <guid>/gaming/2018-07-10-money-equipment-in-fellhold/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-07-10-money-equipment-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I find coming up with equipment lists a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; pain in the ass. Coming up with starting equipment packages? Even harder. So why don&amp;rsquo;t I just use one of the perfectly serviceable equipment lists already out there? Because I definitely buy into the thought that equipment lists are a great way to convey implicit setting and approaches to the game. So I bit the bullet and cranked the below out. It could definitely use some work, and the equipment packs owe a great deal to Brendan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/2012/07/20/odd-equipment/&#34;&gt;excellent OD&amp;amp;D ones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any and all thoughts on how to spice this up are welcome, but I&amp;rsquo;m especially looking to make an evocative random item table so that everybody gets at least one interesting but not-obviously-useful piece of kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9TnQWVbR4kU/W0UEgZ7ZeFI/AAAAAAAAG7o/c2WNKXmSW98AeT953_bmgwvPb52GyYDMgCLcBGAs/s1600/The_potion_seller.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9TnQWVbR4kU/W0UEgZ7ZeFI/AAAAAAAAG7o/c2WNKXmSW98AeT953_bmgwvPb52GyYDMgCLcBGAs/s320/The_potion_seller.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coins of Fellhold  Fellhold has three kinds of coins, issued by the Soul Banks based on the Soul Standard (theoretically, you can take your coins into a bank and demand the current market rate for bottled souls in exchange for your cash, but why would you want to?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper Pennings: The common coin used in most business in Fellhold - a triangle about an inch on a side with a hole in the middle. One copper penning equals one experience point. (CP)  Silver Skillings: 100 Copper Pennings make up one Silver Skilling, so they are used for settling contracts and loans, day to day business between merchants, and the like. A thin, rectangular piece of silver, both sides show fine old-dwarven knotwork.  (SP)  Gold Marks: Worth 100 Silver Skillings, Marks are rarely seen outside of large business deals or the hoards of the wealthy. These fat gold hexagons have a raised outer lip and show a leering devil face on one side and the mark of the bank that stamped it on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Cash &amp;amp; Gear  Player characters begin with 3d6x10 CP, or else can roll for a starting equipment pack by class. Either of these can be supplemented by loans as seen shown below. All characters begin with a backpack, blanket, a waterskin, three helpings of pack food, one torch, and a tinder box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Out Loans  During character creation, PCs may take out one or more loans to secure additional gear. To do so, create a random specialist NPC - this is the PCs creditor. The PC receives a loan of 3d6x10 copper pieces to be used however they see fit. Assign the PC a d4 Loan Usage die. For every week that goes by that the PC does not pay their loan, roll the die. On a maximum result, step the die &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; one step. The PC can move the Loan Die down one step by paying the original loan amount. If it every reaches a d10, their creditor has lost patience and sends out goons to collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers  If you wish to make finding the right place to buy goods as much a part of your game as where to fence adventuring loot, you may create a seller using the Merchant Table in the Specialist NPCs section for each category of gear below. Adjust prices accordingly. The first seller generated carries the entire category of gear. If a player wants to buy something at character generation, they must use the first seller generated - but if players are unhappy with this particular seller, they may search out others by using urbancrawl actions during play. Every new seller has a 50% chance of carrying each item when visited (this can change on future visits, or items can be special ordered for a fee). Every new seller should be added to the game master’s list of NPCs and placed in a neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipment Packs   To speed up character creation, players can elect to roll for a starting equipment pack rather than “shopping” with starting money. This method is especially recommended for new players and when adding a new character to an existing game. Specific items can be substituted with the Game Master’s permission. Players can also step down one or more steps and take 10 CP per step down. All characters begin with a backpack, blanket, a waterskin, three helpings of pack food, one torch, and a tinder box. To generate an equipment pack, roll 3d6 and look in the column for your class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipment List  The lists below give a good flavor of what adventurous types might be most interested in buying in Fellhold, but just about anything can be had in the vast city. Talk to the Game Master about anything you’d like to buy that you don’t see below. All characters begin with a backpack, blanket, a waterskin, three helpings of pack food, one torch, and a tinder box.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Soul Economy in Fellhold</title>
        <link>/gaming/2018-06-29-the-soul-economy-in-fellhold/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:07:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2018-06-29-the-soul-economy-in-fellhold/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2018-06-29-the-soul-economy-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;So, back when I first started rebooting my home campaign setting from a Tentpole Megadungeon generic D&amp;amp;D world that owed a lot to Dwimmermount and into something a little funkier, one of the ideas I hit upon was that the economy would be based on souls. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what that meant, but it seemed cool, so I ran with it. Well, after lots of reading and thinking and coming up with other parts of the world, it finally clicked together into something that makes some (warped, D&amp;amp;D, in-game) sense. To sweeten the deal, I&amp;rsquo;ve included some awesome art that my co-creator &lt;a href=&#34;http://lexiconmegatherium.tumblr.com/tagged/erickochart&#34;&gt;Eric Koch&lt;/a&gt; has done so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SIeNTw4qhvk/Wzaepz09jxI/AAAAAAAAG6s/J-pZb6ThJpsTAUkZJtmrNkHoPenveN4iwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fellhold_City_View%2B%25281%2529.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SIeNTw4qhvk/Wzaepz09jxI/AAAAAAAAG6s/J-pZb6ThJpsTAUkZJtmrNkHoPenveN4iwCLcBGAs/s320/Fellhold_City_View%2B%25281%2529.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief Word on How We Got to Now  Far back in dimly remembered times, the Dwarves arose as the first mighty kingdom and took over all the peoples of the lands they could reach. After tens of hundreds of years of dwarven overlordship, nomads of the steppe swept over the empire and made it their own with the help of dark sorcery. These witch kings took on much of the Dwarven culture, liking what they found, but they kept their magical ways, lengthening their lives through many means. After many, many kings, a group of them enacted a ritual to give them unending life - of a sort. The ritual worked, creating the mighty Lich Kings, but so great was their work that it killed the gods. The world turned wrong after that, and eventually the kings and the remnants of their folk had nowhere to run but to a far flung outpost on the edge of the world across the sea - Fellhold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xeIEnLffgV0/Wzae3xvsQEI/AAAAAAAAG6w/wCnOW7SQmXQ6SvXjV5TrCKM6irIEekLswCLcBGAs/s1600/Fellhold_-_plague_demon.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xeIEnLffgV0/Wzae3xvsQEI/AAAAAAAAG6w/wCnOW7SQmXQ6SvXjV5TrCKM6irIEekLswCLcBGAs/s320/Fellhold_-_plague_demon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth of the Fiends  When the gods were murdered, their blood fell to earth - pure, concentrated soulstuff, stronger and more fearsome than anything tied to a mortal body. Where it struck, the dumb things of the world - sticks, rocks, beasts, and birds, and so forth - took on the twisted mockery of a soul. Some tiny and petty, others mighty and awful. So were born the fiends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Closing of the Underworld  Something in the liches’ ritual or its aftermath closed our world to the underworld, and the souls of the dead were left to wander around this world unseen and unfelt but by those with the power to do so. Fellhold is wholly full of ghosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Souls and Soulstuff  It is well known that souls are made up of many parts, each its own bit of the whole man or woman. All of these bits are made of soulstuff, the same stuff that godsblood and fiends are made of. Like energy or matter, soulstuff cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change form and state and be moved around. When someone dies, some bits of their soul hang together and become a ghost - others pass on to family or back into the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bits of the Soul  1. Lyke - The Body   2. Hame - Shape, Seeming  3. Ond - Breath  4. Hugh - Will and Wits  5. Myne - Memory   6. Wode - Inspiration  7. Hamingja - Luck, Might  8. Fetch - Guardian/Magical Spirit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone dies, they lose their Lyke and their Ond, and most of the time lose their Wode, Hamingja, and Fetch. The Hamingja most times passes to close kin, children if the dead had them. Sometimes the fetch goes along to a child, but more often goes out into the world on its own, and rarely finds its way into fiendhood of its own. The wode most often fades back into the world, to be mixed with that of others and taken up by new life, just as the flesh is in the world we can touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghosts  So, when folks die, they are left with some bit of their Hame, their Hugh, and their Myne. Of these, Myne is far the strongest. Over time, ghosts lose more and more of their Hugh and their Hame, becoming lost, confused, and vague, but their Myne ties them to those things most weighty in their life - often home or kin, but betimes hatred and death. Ghosts sometimes fade together to strengthen the bits that go together - so, your many dead forefathers and foremothers might all fade into a vague set of ancestor spirits. Others are so tied to their homes or other steads that they’ll become a part of the soul of the place - very old and well loved (or hated) buildings have a strong character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYUkyLqmUf8/WzafBXh5qoI/AAAAAAAAG64/6cpO4bLyWDcm8pN1uPb178ujw-2JJZpyACLcBGAs/s1600/Fellhold_dungeonHacker.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYUkyLqmUf8/WzafBXh5qoI/AAAAAAAAG64/6cpO4bLyWDcm8pN1uPb178ujw-2JJZpyACLcBGAs/s320/Fellhold_dungeonHacker.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottling Ghosts  At some time in the past, someone clever came up with a way to put ghosts into bottles. When done well, using the right kind of glass, these bottles stop the bleeding away of a ghost’s soulstuff over time - at least so far as anyone can tell since ghosts have been bottled. So, ghosts who are bottled get to keep their selves, and can come out sometimes, like when the great grandkids come over. The rest of the time it’s awfully lonesome, though. At least unbottled ghosts have each other to see and talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiends and Souls  The souls of living beings belong to them, fair and square - they take no thought in how readily they call upon the different bits of their soul, nor even feel any difference between them. For fiends it is otherwise. Fiends are squatters on their own souls, and their soulstuff comes from the dead mess of the godsblood. Some started with more, others less, but all hunger and thirst for as much soulstuff as they can get - always more. Soulstuff, though, cannot be eaten, drunk, or taken - only given or lost. Over the years, fiends have tried many ways to get what they yearn for, some combing the unseen world for the leavings of fled Wode or Ond, others eating the flesh of the dead, until they found something truly deep: they gain the same strength from owning a soul as from taking it into their own soulstuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vQVK7EJbHE4/WzafWUL0mZI/AAAAAAAAG7I/5kKxzJGmJHU5giIsX72C5C5OPTjmp3ICQCLcBGAs/s1600/Env_concept02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vQVK7EJbHE4/WzafWUL0mZI/AAAAAAAAG7I/5kKxzJGmJHU5giIsX72C5C5OPTjmp3ICQCLcBGAs/s320/Env_concept02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rise of Soul Banks  Some fiends took note of the bottling of ghosts and the lore of soul ownership and thought up something truly clever. They saw that they could own bottled souls and get everything they wanted. Overtime, further cleverness came about: learning that holding a loan as collateral counts as “owning”, that the bits of the soul could be bottled on their own, and that ownership can be shared without breaking up the soul - only the shares of ownership. And so what started as piles of ghost bottles squirreled away in dark holes grew into great shared vaults, which grew into huge joint stock businesses that now back all of the ebb and flow of commerce in the great city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Quick Word on Worship and Magic  Worship and Magic both involve efforts of the Hugh, though magic also needs to draw on the Hamingja. Worshipping and making magic create a kind of energy from these bits of the soul - not pulling away the actual substance, but made by it, like heat or sound coming from a place of friction. Such &amp;ldquo;heat and sound&amp;rdquo; can then pass energy into other soulstuff, strengthening it without enlarging it. So some fiends seek out the worship of living beings, and others make deals with mighty wizards as other ways to gain strength beyond owning souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FuZscmxJQu8/WzafdJj2H3I/AAAAAAAAG7Q/WgsOYzBLIDshU7HjMi0d3r-N6JCR5jmAgCLcBGAs/s1600/Env_concept01_bad.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FuZscmxJQu8/WzafdJj2H3I/AAAAAAAAG7Q/WgsOYzBLIDshU7HjMi0d3r-N6JCR5jmAgCLcBGAs/s320/Env_concept01_bad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling Your Soul  All of this means that the folk of Fellhold have many ways they can “sell their soul”, whether they want to set up a will to be bottled and kept safe upon their natural death, or if they reckon they don’t need their Luck as much as they need to make this month’s rent, all the way up to signing on to a stint as a draug thrall, bottling their soul in the meantime and loaning out their Lyke, Hame, and Ond to work for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qyXB0elUO7w/WzafIdLNroI/AAAAAAAAG7A/mGKuog-tnKsrdcUKrCVCHm_tLD5tYY6cQCLcBGAs/s1600/Coins.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qyXB0elUO7w/WzafIdLNroI/AAAAAAAAG7A/mGKuog-tnKsrdcUKrCVCHm_tLD5tYY6cQCLcBGAs/s320/Coins.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Souls and Coins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when you put all of this together, you have a thing that is very worthwhile to some and somewhat worthwhile to everyone (bottled souls), that takes a fairly fixed amount of work to make (a life). You can’t spend that thing day to day, however, so you need something else. Over time, the banks took over from the Witch Kings in minting coins, each a token worth some tiny bit of a one of the souls in their vault. If you truly wished, you could take a pile of coins, go into your bank, and walk out with bottled ghosts, maybe to seek a better payout at a neighboring bank - but day to day, almost no one does this. So souls work the way that gold used to work for bank notes and pre-fiat currencies in our own world - the underlying asset that the money gets its worth from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Culture is a Story that Isn&#39;t Over Yet</title>
        <link>/coaching/2018-03-27-culture-is-a-story-that-isnt-over-yet/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/coaching/2018-03-27-culture-is-a-story-that-isnt-over-yet/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2018-03-27-culture-is-a-story-that-isnt-over-yet/ -&lt;p&gt;Stories are essential for building and maintaining strong cultures. They help everyone learn the group&amp;rsquo;s way of doing things, create belonging, and make meaning out of what they do every day. In fact, you can define culture as an ongoing story that a group tells together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultures share a way of thinking about things. All of us shape our thinking with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/&#34;&gt;mental models&lt;/a&gt;, which help us to see blind spots, work better, and understand what we learn. In fact, you might say culture is nothing but a bundle of mental models shared by a group. One snag with mental models is that they have a lot of inertia - it takes a while to think with them day-to-day, and it takes at least as long to stop. So when we want to craft a culture that brings new folks in, like that of a business, we have to find a way to not only teach those models that make the group tick, but also overcome some of the mental models show up. It turns out that stories are a great &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://danielcoyle.com/2018/02/06/how-to-think-about-culture/&#34;&gt;delivery mechanism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; for mental models. Not only are stories easier to call to mind, which helps the mental model get a foothold in your head, they also show the mental model at work, rather than as a lifeless concept . Those new to Southwest learn a lot more about how to deal with each other from the story about that time &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Kelleher&#34;&gt;Herb Kelleher&lt;/a&gt;, drove to the airport to give a flight attendant a ride home than it does to tell them &amp;ldquo;we take care of each other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides teaching mental models, stories are how folks work out what happens around them and give it meaning. &amp;ldquo;Meaning&amp;rdquo; can be a tough word to pin down, but for the culture of a group it comes down to: &amp;ldquo;why do I wake up and come here every morning?&amp;rdquo; For many folks, their own stories will answer this: &amp;ldquo;I worked hard learning skills to land a good job, and now I work hard to take care of my kids, and some day I&amp;rsquo;ll retire and fish all day.&amp;rdquo; On the other hand, truly great groups with strong cultures, craft larger stories that everyone can weave themselves into: &amp;ldquo;someday, the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing today will help this company cure cancer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we put together the thoughts that cultures are a bundle of ways to understand the world and that stories can give meaning to day to day work, we get an insight into what cultures truly are: an unfolding story a group tells itself about the world and what it might be. If a story is a thread stringing together deeds and outcomes, then a shared way of working toward meaningful outcomes is just a story that isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet. In the same way that the technology in a science fiction story sets what sort of plots can or can&amp;rsquo;t happen, so do the mental models of a culture give the framework for which actions will or won&amp;rsquo;t fly in the culture&amp;rsquo;s shared world. And just as a good story has a theme that tells us something about ourselves or the world we live in, so the goal of a team makes meaning for those on it. Following the thread of the group&amp;rsquo;s mental models to get from where they are now to where they want to go tells a story day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories help people know how to act, get them working together, and give meaning to that work. With that understanding, we can look at cultures as stories that are being told together by the groups that have them. What story does your organization tell?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Power of Intuition</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /reading/the-power-of-intuition/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Gary Klein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very same things are what excited me and disappointed me the most in this book. It presents intuition as a very no-nonsense ability that is critical for effective decision making, and gives advice on how to train to be better at it. Exactly what I wanted! On the other hand, it describes &amp;ldquo;intuition&amp;rdquo; as simply the ability to learn to detect patterns and apply past experiences to current situations, without consciously realizing  you&amp;rsquo;ve made that match - which is rather less romantic than I might hope for something as big and spooky as &amp;ldquo;intuition&amp;rdquo; to be. Once I set aside my childish disappointment, though, I found this book to be full of gems, and more importantly, to include detailed instructions on how to practice and train your team on these skills. I was expecting some help on decision making and ended up walking away with great techniques for leadership and creativity as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Power-Intuition-Feelings-Better-Decisions-ebook/dp/B001334J00/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1517861417&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building Connections with Oral Storytelling</title>
        <link>/coaching/2018-01-29-building-connections-with-oral-storytelling/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2018-01-29-building-connections-with-oral-storytelling/ -&lt;p&gt;Humans have been telling stories face to face since forever, and doing it well gives you a leg up personally and professionally. Compelling business presentations are critical for success, and natural storytelling techniques can take them to the next level. Even outside of business, stories help you build relationships and entertain your friends. You can improve your oral storytelling today by paying attention to structure, shortening your stories, using your voice well, and supporting what you say with your face and hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral storytelling doesn’t just happen around a campfire - it’s something you can do anytime you’re the center of attention, whether presenting, at a party, or yes, even camping. By &amp;ldquo;oral storytelling&amp;rdquo;, I mean telling a story to an audience that can see and hear you. Many of the techniques will also work with sound only, but our baseline assumption is that you are telling your story to someone in the same room. In the digital age, many folks overlook how rich a channel face to face interaction is - you have the content of the words themselves, of course, but also your tone of voice, facial expression, timing, volume, hand gestures, referencing things in your immediate environment, and so on. The most important differentiator, though, is feedback - you can actually watch how your story is landing and tweak as you go - an enormously powerful gift that authors and painters would kill for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any storytelling, always start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/11/3/storytelling-part-2-structure&#34;&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;. For oral storytelling, structure is especially important, because it lacks some of the other cues that might help people follow the thread of the story. In written stories, paragraphs, headers, and typographic styles help to make clear how thoughts are organized. In a movie or graphic novel, visual actions can make obvious the intent of even subtle or confusing dialog. With oral storytelling, everything must happen in our audience&amp;rsquo;s heads - which is both the challenge and the strength of the form. When your audience is engaged, they are an active participant, not a passive consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make participation easy, help them out with a solid structure. Dan Roam&amp;rsquo;s PUMA tools introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/11/3/storytelling-part-2-structure&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; were created for in-person presentations, and the most time-tested template is Drama, modeled on the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey&#34;&gt;Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. This is the form that stories have taken all over the world for as long as there have been stories to tell. Every Disney movie, every episode of the week, every bedtime story follows this form. All of this means that we really know this structure deep in our bones, and we won&amp;rsquo;t get lost in stories that follow it - even with unfamiliar characters, stakes, and action. When in doubt, try to structure any personal stories this way, and if you can get away with it, do the same thing with business stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have a good structure, the next most critical factor is length. Unlike a book, where people can put it down whenever they want, they&amp;rsquo;re stuck listening to your whole story in one go. As storytellers it&amp;rsquo;s on us to give our audience something worth paying attention to. While great storytellers can keep audiences enthralled for a long time, you make your job a lot easier by reducing how much &amp;ldquo;good story&amp;rdquo; you have to craft - which you do by keeping your stories short and sweet. As guidance on how to achieve this, my favorite advice comes from Ramit Sethi:  &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-tell-killer-stories/&#34;&gt;Start late and end early&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Get to the good stuff quickly, and don&amp;rsquo;t linger too long once you&amp;rsquo;ve covered it. Without training, most of us err on the side of too much context - lots of set up and wrapping up. &amp;ldquo;Start late&amp;rdquo; means you should come in as close to the main point of the story as possible. &amp;ldquo;End Early&amp;rdquo; means don&amp;rsquo;t detail all of the follow up after the climax. You need a little bit of resolution for a story to feel complete, but rather than detailing all 107 times you&amp;rsquo;ve used that life lesson from summer camp, just sum up how it has changed you for the better. If you find it hard to remove details, remember one of the strengths of oral storytelling: people can always ask for more if they want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;re recounting your story, besides what you&amp;rsquo;re saying, you&amp;rsquo;ll also want to pay attention to how you&amp;rsquo;re saying it. Your voice is the main way you do this. All of us do an incredible amount of sophisticated stuff with our voices without even realizing it - conveying complex emotional undertones, subtly altering timing for comedic effect, raising and lowering volume to match energy levels, and so on. Many of these techniques can be learned as specific tricks or tips - for example, try humming &amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rdquo; before you speak, and your voice will come out a little richer. These are the kind of things you can consciously learn from singing or speaking classes. As a starting point, though, I encourage you to take advantage of the lifetime of practice you have using your voice unconsciously. Rather than trying specific techniques with your voice, instead focus on the emotional and psychological state you want portray to your audience and then do something you did as a kid - play pretend. Need to depict the angry drunk from the bar? Imagine yourself feeling mad and drunk. Describing the life changing emotional experience of the sun rising over the mountains in Yellowstone? Vividly picture being back there, and let your voice do the work. As you start doing this more often, you&amp;rsquo;ll develop more awareness of what you&amp;rsquo;re actually doing - &amp;ldquo;oh, when I&amp;rsquo;m acting mad, I raise my voice this much&amp;rdquo; - which you can later tweak as you pick up some conscious techniques or see how people react to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides your voice, you also have a wealth of visual aids at your disposal: your hands, expressions, and posture. Even though your voice and words are the stars of the show, your hands and face are important supporting actors. The same advice for &amp;ldquo;embodying&amp;rdquo; emotions applies to facial expressions as it does to tone of voice. You may want to learn to slightly exaggerate your facial expressions for a greater impact - it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun to practice making the biggest, most ridiculous expressions you can while looking in a mirror. For posture, you generally want to stand up straight and confident, but sometimes you may want to hunch over or lean in to bring parts of the story to life. Hand gestures are much harder to pin down for advice. Depending on your background and culture, you may naturally and frequently &amp;ldquo;talk with your hands&amp;rdquo;, in which case, keep doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. If not, though, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to start using some intentional gestures when telling your stories. A few basics to get you started are things like holding your hands out palm up to offer something, bringing them down forcefully to convey drama or surprise, or gesturing back towards yourself to emphasize your own role or feelings in the story. As with the other techniques, the trick is to find movements that feel natural and support what you&amp;rsquo;re saying. Practice and feedback will help out a lot here, but start out by making sure your hands are not in your pockets, behind your back, messing with your hair, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s all kinds of resources on oral storytelling you can check out if you want more, but if you have tightly structured, concise stories told with energy and animation, you’ll have audiences hanging on your words in no time. Take advantage of this very rich, very human channel by using the &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rsquo;s journey&amp;rdquo; where possible, tighten up your stories to be short and sweet, and use your voice and expressions to heighten the emotion of what you&amp;rsquo;re telling at the time. As with any other skill, practice with good feedback is what will get you there. Fortunately, telling stories is something you&amp;rsquo;ll have lots of opportunities to practice in low stakes settings: hanging out with friends, going out, dinner with your family - anywhere people gather.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jeff Russell Storytime</title>
        <link>/coaching/2018-01-22-jeff-russell-storytime/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/coaching/2018-01-22-jeff-russell-storytime/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2018-01-22-jeff-russell-storytime/ -&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite memories from the Army is “Jeff Russell Storytime”. It seemed like a silly way to pass the time, but ended up teaching me a lot that I still use today. Out of way too much free time, it evolved into a regular occurrence that we all enjoyed a lot. I got to share some of my favorite gems from history and mythology, and over time I learned a thing or two about storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember precisely how it became a “thing”, but somewhere along the line, my buddies started specifically requesting “Jeff Russell Storytime”. I’m sure it started out as at least half-joking, but over time I think they enjoyed listening as much as I did telling. You see, in the Army you have a lot of time standing around with nothing much to do, especially in the infantry. Guard duty, police lines, waiting around for assignments - we all became very accustomed to the different flavors of waiting around. So, I started telling my friends stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the stories I told came from history and mythology, thanks to my classical education, but a few were personal anecdotes. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bunch of grunts interested in hearing about, say, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Whitby&#34;&gt;Synod of Whitby&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector#Duel_with_Achilles&#34;&gt;Achilles and Hector&lt;/a&gt;, or how the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War#Origins_of_the_war&#34;&gt;Mexican-American War&lt;/a&gt; got started. I was slightly less surprised at their interest in personally embarrassing stories, often involving a bit too much to drink. A few were favorites, requested multiple times, others were whatever I could come up with at the time. Some fell a little flat, obviously, but I was helped out by the afore mentioned “nothing else to do”. That helps make for a pretty forgiving audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was just entertaining myself and my friends, and didn’t give much thought to what I might be learning from it. Looking back, though, telling these stories in front of a live audience taught me a lot of important lessons that I’ve been able to apply in my business and personal life.  Listening to which stories were requested and how people reacted helped me learn what was interesting. Watching interest wax and wane gave me a sense of how to pace things. Paying that kind of attention gave me lots of practice reading the nuances of a crowd’s reaction, and as I learned to be aware of that, I figured out how to use my voice and gestures to get certain effects and heighten the drama of the telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve explored a lot of different sorts of storytelling here on the blog, but old-fashioned in-person oral storytelling has a lot to recommend it, and you can use it in all sorts of situations. As the above shows, to get the practice you don’t even have to tell your own stories - you can tell anything you know and find interesting, and over time you’ll get the knack for reading an audience and altering your telling to suit them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /reading/the-consolations-of-philosophy/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Alain de Botton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book provides a great overview of the tradition of Western philosophy. Besides providing useful summaries of some of the major thinkers and what their philosophy can do for you in your life, it shows the the connecting threads between thinkers that might seem totally unrelated at first glance. Each chapter gives a brief thumbnail of the biography and thinking of a major philosopher, which is great, but what&amp;rsquo;s really useful about this book is that every chapter addresses a specific concern that everyone faces - such as unpopularity, money, and frustration. Alain&amp;rsquo;s style is warm and gentle, with a hint of detached humor that makes for enjoyable reading. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever thought &amp;ldquo;I wish I knew more about philosophy&amp;rdquo;, this is the place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life&#34;&gt;operating manuals&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Approach for a Virtuous Life</title>
        <link>/coaching/2018-01-15-my-approach-for-a-virtuous-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/coaching/2018-01-15-my-approach-for-a-virtuous-life/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2018-01-15-my-approach-for-a-virtuous-life/ -&lt;p&gt;Today I run the risk of sounding  a bit preachy. Let me state for the first (but not last) time that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell you how to live your life or what “being good” means. We all want to be good people, but many of us have different perspectives on what that means. Even worse, almost every terrible ethical lapse you read about in the news began years ago with a gradual slip. We can all fall prey to this, so it helps to clearly spell out our code of behavior. That’s why I’ve laid out below the process I followed to settle on my own virtues, and the steps I take to try to live up to them. I hope that you get some ideas on how you might think about and reinforce your own principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year ago, I was struck by something &lt;a href=&#34;http://jockopodcast.com/&#34;&gt;Jocko Willink&lt;/a&gt; said about needing to know what your values are so that you can be sure you are living up to them. He further suggested that it was a good idea to periodically check in and confirm that your stated principles really are what you believe and want to uphold. This struck me as quite good advice, and so I decided to figure out what virtues were important to me along with a way to keep track of how I was doing. Obviously this is an ongoing struggle, and I make no claims on being particularly virtuous. Rather than trying to convince you to live by my virtues, I hope that I provide a model of how you might identify and live by your virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I realized with some horror that I had no identifiable virtues of my own, just a lot of vague moral intuitions and behavioral codes I had followed in the past. Since I do not follow any of the major religions, going by one of their lists was out, so I reckoned I had to define my own. I sought out sources which spoke to what I thought was right: everything from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.army.mil/values/&#34;&gt;Army Values&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#Ethics_and_virtues&#34;&gt;Stoic Virtues&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Awaken-Giant-Within-Immediate-Emotional-ebook/dp/B001EM101Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516034506&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=awaken+the+giant+within&#34;&gt;Tony Robbins&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angelfire.com/nc/broomcloset/aetheling.html&#34;&gt;Anglo-Saxon Thews&lt;/a&gt; and more. From each of these sources, I created a mindmap on &lt;a href=&#34;https://realtimeboard.com/&#34;&gt;Realtime Board&lt;/a&gt; with each separate virtue as a node, first grouped by their sources. I then created connections between the virtues that seemed to be related to each other somehow, and then I clumped together those that seemed to reflect similar concepts - &lt;a href=&#34;http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/idea-creation-tools/overview/affinity.html&#34;&gt;affinity mapping&lt;/a&gt;, basically. The end result was something my friend described as an “Ant’s Nest” and looked like a crazy person’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.weirdshitpodcast.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/download-1.jpg?resize=672%2C372&#34;&gt;conspiracy board&lt;/a&gt;. I did not create a visual that would help other people, but the process of building it forced me to look very closely at dozens of potential virtues, figure out what I believed in and how they were similar or different, and otherwise deeply immerse myself in them. The end result was a deep internalization of the values put forward in all of the sources I chose as well as my own understanding of how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that work, I ended up with nine virtues in three groups. As I said, I do not say that these are the right virtues for anyone but myself, but for the sake of example, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;head&#34;&gt;Head&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these virtues involve thinking and using your head. They are related to humanity’s innate capacity for reason, as separate from the animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groundedness&lt;/strong&gt;: Presence, humility, moderation. The ability to pause and step outside of emotions and impressions and remain calm. In many ways, this virtue enables all of the others when they would otherwise be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth&lt;/strong&gt;: Dedication to facing the world as it truly is and reflecting that in word and deed. Besides speaking the truth, it includes curiosity, rationality, and the willingness to accept hard truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied smarts. Wisdom is both the love of knowledge and the active application of that knowledge to living a good life. Many of the virtues tell me what to do, but wisdom usually encompasses how to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chest&#34;&gt;Chest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These virtues are the higher sort of emotional virtues - the kind of thing that makes you shed a tear at a powerful scene in a movie. They provide the bridge between the colder virtues of the Head and the heated virtues of the Belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;: Kindness, generosity, humor, and cheerfulness. Treating everyone well, not just those close to you. Without this virtue, all of the others might turn overly inward or selfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troth&lt;/strong&gt;: Loyalty, hospitality, duty, and respect. An old timey word now mostly only seen in the word betroth. This virtue covers my obligations to others as a social animal. Somewhat more formal and less warm than Love, but still rooted in a sense of shared humanity and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth&lt;/strong&gt;: Excellence, honor, virtue. In many ways, this is the master virtue. If you are familiar with the Greek concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete_(moral_virtue)&#34;&gt;arete&lt;/a&gt;, that comes close to hitting the mark. The virtue of living and acting well, of doing things the very best you can, because it is worthwhile in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;belly&#34;&gt;Belly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the fiery virtues of primal life. They are the least distinguished from animals, but are still necessary to provide the drive and power to make the other virtues possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunger&lt;/strong&gt;: Ambition, decisiveness, energy. Hunger is the desire to strive and do and achieve. By itself, it can become a vice, but absolutely necessary to make achieving the other virtues possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guts&lt;/strong&gt;: Bravery, courage. Just as you need Hunger to desire to do better, you need Guts to do the right thing even when its hard. Includes physical and moral bravery, which are more closely linked than many suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grit&lt;/strong&gt;: Discipline, industriousness, persistence, toughness. Grit is the virtue of sticking with things and pushing through when it gets hard through sheer stubbornness. Many great things only exist on the other side of pain - Hunger and Guts start you on the path there, but Grit carries you through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve seen an example list of virtues, what might you do to make them real in your life? I was inspired by Benjamin Franklin’s method of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirteenvirtues.com/&#34;&gt;keeping track of his virtues&lt;/a&gt;, and I have adapted it to my daily journal. At the top of the page on each new day, I draw a little box with my nine virtues in three columns of three rows, each with space next to them for a mark. At the end of the day, I reflect and ask myself how I did. To make it as easy as possible to evaluate, I assume I followed my virtue unless I can think of an example where I failed. If I can think of no examples, I put a happy face next to the virtue. If I failed, I put a sad face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage of making me think about my virtues at the beginning of the day (when I lay out my page) and at the end (when I ask how I did), and provides me a record of which virtues I might be struggling with the most. Something I’m considering is coming up with more clear criteria for each virtue about what constitutes failing in it, because I don’t want to give myself a pass for things I need to recognize. Even still, I believe there’s value in continuously reinforcing that I am the kind of person who acts in those ways - making it easier to act in accordance with that self-perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: each day, I pick a challenge for one of the virtues. I move through them in sequence, rotating around when I get to the end. Where my default is to look out for failures of each virtue, the point here is to encourage me to actively improve in that virtue. So, for example, a common challenge for days where “Guts” is the focus virtue is “Do something that scares you”, or for Love I might have “Perform an unexpected act of generosity for a stranger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said many times already, I do not expect my nine virtues will match your values, but I’ve provided a model of how you might incorporate your own virtues into your life. By thinking about what sources you want to inform your approach, selecting qualities from them, and finding links and clumping them together, you can arrive at your own manageable list of virtues. Once you have them, you can keep track of them with an “assumed pass” system plus a challenge to keep you from getting comfortable. Whether you use any of these techniques or not, I encourage you to think about what your values, principles, or virtues are, and to make a conscious effort every day to live up to them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /reading/the-artists-way/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Julia Cameron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that if I picked this book up sight unseen and flipped through it, I would likely have put it back on the shelf - it has a lot of markers for being a bit too &amp;ldquo;woo woo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;touchy feely&amp;rdquo; for my usual tastes. Fortunately, it came highly recommended by a bunch of well-grounded people that I respect, so I decided to give it a shot, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. The basic premise is that everyone can be creative, but most of us have developed the idea that we&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to or have otherwise blocked our access to our creative selves. To counteract this, it provides a twelve week guided program to lead to greater creativity. I&amp;rsquo;m not very far into the program, but already I am seeing the benefit of its two core habits: &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/&#34;&gt;Morning Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/&#34;&gt;Artist Dates&lt;/a&gt;. If you are already convinced that you could be more creative with some help and don&amp;rsquo;t need as much back up, consider going straight to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Workbook-Julia-Cameron-ebook/dp/B001QL5MQ4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1515369412&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=artist%27s+way&#34;&gt;workbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /reading/strategy-a-history/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Lawrence Freedman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man oh man am I loving this book. It puts out a comprehensive record of thinking about the concept of strategy in western thought from the Bible and Homer all the way to modern theorists. Along the way, Freedman provides analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various formulations and their applications. Despite what might turn into a dry, intellectual subject, the book is quite clear and readable, moving briskly through trends and eras of thought. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s greatest value is highlighting the connections and influences between figures as disparate as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and John Boyd. I suspect that I will be coming back to my notes on this and its bibliography for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Expanded Definition of Reading</title>
        <link>/coaching/2017-12-18-an-expanded-definition-of-reading/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/coaching/2017-12-18-an-expanded-definition-of-reading/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /coaching/2017-12-18-an-expanded-definition-of-reading/ -&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of “reading” as the time we have a book in front of our face, but when you stop to ask why you are reading, a number of other activities suggest themselves as part of the bigger enterprise. If you are reading to learn, simply passing your eyes over the words will only get you a fraction of what’s there. I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about how to make reading as effective as possible, and below I share my current thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some idea of what might fall under this broader umbrella, it’s helpful to ask “what exactly are we trying to get out of reading?” You might read for fun or to kill time. You might read to practice a particular language. You might be looking for inspiration on crafting prose. I have read for all of these reasons and plan to continue to do so, but for today, I want to talk about reading to learn. When I read non-fiction (and some fiction), I am looking to take someone else’s insight and wisdom and incorporate it into my own understanding. This focus makes it clearer what activities support the goal of “reading”: picking the right material, engaging with the text actively, and reflecting on what we’ve read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we ever pick up a book we can make our reading more effective by what we select. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/02/book-recommendations-from-nassim-taleb/&#34;&gt;Nasim Taleb&lt;/a&gt; advocates giving heavy preference to older books. He reasons that books that stick around for a long time have shown that they’re worthwhile, whereas the jury is still out on new stuff. I share a lot of sympathy with this approach, especially when it comes to reading about “wisdom”, but if you want to learn about new technologies and scientific discoveries, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne&#34;&gt;Montaigne&lt;/a&gt; might not be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you make sure you’re reading high quality stuff? That’s a tough question, and one I continually think about. Right now, I’d say that the best filter for high quality is recommendations from a trusted source - preferably someone you know who has enough overlap in tastes and interest to know whether you’d like something or not. I’ve started cultivating these kinds of recommendations by inviting my more readerly friends to an &lt;em&gt;Inverse Book Club&lt;/em&gt;. In a normal book club, everyone reads the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; book. In this one, we all read &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; books and share our thoughts. It does a remarkable job of exposing you to material that is at once interesting to you but not something you would have picked up on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next best qualifier is a source whose tastes and preferences you know pretty well, but you don’t necessarily agree with. Think of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Movies_(U.S._TV_series)&#34;&gt;Siskel &amp;amp; Ebert&lt;/a&gt;: you might not have shared their tastes, but they were pretty clear about what they liked, so you can make informed decisions based on what they think. I had a friend in high school with the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; taste in movies from me - if he hated something, it was a good bet I’d like it, and vice versa. This same filter can apply with recommendations from bloggers and podcast hosts and other people that you engage with less actively than your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the crowd - what’s this book’s Amazon rating? Was it a best seller? Is everybody talking about it? There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but it’s less likely to direct you to &lt;em&gt;exactly what you need&lt;/em&gt;. It also works better when you have some idea what you’re looking for already, like “hmmm, I want to read about physics, what’s the best popular science book on physics?” If you are trying to find wholly new material that you wouldn’t have considered, you’re less likely to get it from looking at what’s popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we evaluate a book’s worth, we also want to give thought to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we want to read about. Do we want to go deep on a topic and read five books in a row on the same subject? Or do we want to introduce some new models into our thinking and read something totally outside of our comfort zone? I think that both are worthwhile, but I have trouble getting the exact right ratio and rhythm down. I mostly go by what I’m interested in, but that introduces the danger of getting bored with something right on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/11/11/neil-gaimans-advice-to-writers-get-bored/&#34;&gt;edge of pushing through to real insight&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to know your own quirks: I tend to enjoy learning about a lot of things, so I probably need to push myself to pursue depth more. If you are an expert on a narrow field, maybe you need to read outside of that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve selected a book, we’ll get more out of reading by actively engaging with the text. It turns out that simple highlighting doesn’t actually do much to improve recall. Taking notes, on the other hand, &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/05/26/monday-master-class-the-study-hacks-guide-to-note-taking/&#34;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a delicate balance to keep up with the flow of what you’re reading while also stopping to think enough to make connections and help things sink in. My current approach with physical books is to make notes in the margins and to underline quotes or references to other works. With electronic books, I type notes with the date and page number in an Evernote note and highlight anything I want to come back to and record later (like references or good quotes). When I take notes, I try to focus on making connections with concepts I already know, other books I’ve read, and differing points of view. It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of passively nodding along with a book in a way you never would with someone in a conversation. So try to put yourself in the mindset of an intellectually stimulating conversation with your smart friend that you don’t always agree with - be ready to challenge, learn, and find commonalities that aren’t obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading, we can improve recall and strengthen connections through reflection. With some very important books, I’ve gone so far as to go over all my highlights and type them up, cluster references by theme and pull out any exercises or instructions into their own section. Doing this on every single book would probably be overkill. More recently, a friend has turned me onto a very simple approach as a bare minimum per book: when you finish, write a paragraph or so of your thoughts in a journal, either paper or digital. Another technique is to ask Scott Young’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/06/22/stop-forgetting/&#34;&gt;retention questions&lt;/a&gt;. However you do it, reflection is really just an extension of the active engagement you cultivated while reading the book and strengthening the ties you’ve made with other material. As you get into it, this reflection and thinking bleeds into the selection we discussed and becomes a cycle. You read a book that makes you think about something else you’ve read, the intersection of those two ideas suggests a new area to explore, and so you ask a friend for a recommendation in that field, and you’re off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a motivated person that cares about reading, it’s easy to focus on maximizing something like pages read per week, but if that’s your entire definition of reading, you may be missing out on the actual &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of the activity. I hope that expanding your definition of reading helps you to apply those same skills to carving out time to pick the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; books, actively &lt;em&gt;engage&lt;/em&gt; with them while you read, and to &lt;em&gt;reflect&lt;/em&gt; on what you’ve read so it sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /reading/the-4-hour-chef/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Tim Ferriss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being a phenomenal &amp;ldquo;learn to cook from nothing&amp;rdquo; cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn &lt;em&gt;anything.&lt;/em&gt; Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn&amp;rsquo;t done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it&amp;rsquo;s rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in &lt;em&gt;The 4 Hour Workweek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The 4 Hour Body&lt;/em&gt;, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other &amp;ldquo;how to learn&amp;rdquo; frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re already a master cook, check this book out for it&amp;rsquo;s advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
