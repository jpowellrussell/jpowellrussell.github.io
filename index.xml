    <i>A Quick Mark: I'm spending the holiday weekend with my kin, and I didn't knock out the editing ahead of time as I meant to. As such, I've put up the post to make it for the week, but I may make some fairly big changes over the next few days.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the things I've been working on with this blog is to put more work into getting writing posted than to carefully laying everything out from first steps. For one, that has helped me stick to getting a post out every week, and for another, I kind of didn't think anyone else would read this. At this point, though, I've written a fair amount of posts that take as given some things about what I believe that I haven't spelled out anywhere, and I thought it would be helpful to have one post to send folks to when I write more posts about <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">small details in myths</a> or <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#last_hail_idun">prayers to Germanish Gods and Goddesses</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This post is also an experiment in telling more of a personal story. Most of the time I like writing about thoughts and books and beliefs and such, but maybe opening up a bit will help ground where that stuff is coming from. Or maybe this is self-indulgent - let me know what you think.
    </p>

    <p>
    One more thing before we get to it. This post is about my religious beliefs, but I'm not trying to sell you on anything. If you find anything here helpful, or if it echos your own experience, I'd love to hear from you and talk shop, but I'm not trying to <i>push</i> anything on you. My spiritual path so far has taught me that belief is <i>deeply</i> personal, <i>hugely</i> varied, and <i>often</i> weird, so I don't expect what has worked for me to be what you need.  That being said, let's take a look at where that path has taken me so far.
    </p>

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org723078c">
    <p>
    As a kid, my folks took me and my sister to a United Methodist church most every week. I don't remember if we went <i>every</i> Sunday, but it was close enough, along with Sunday School. Mostly I remember doing arts and crafts about Biblical stories, and church was just one of those boring things my folks took me along to, like when my dad went to look at home theater equipment or my mom and sister went clothes shopping. But at least sometimes there were donuts.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first somewhat serious engagement with Christianity I remember was thanks to a summer camp I attended twice. I had a friend come back from a camp called Sky Ranch and tell me how awesome it was - water slides, horseback riding, even a "Blob" like in the movie Heavyweights (to be fair - when I saw Heavyweights, I was like "just like at Sky Ranch!"). I begged my parents to let me go and they reluctantly agreed, since at age eight, this would be my first sleepaway camp. I didn't know it was a Bible camp until I got there and every meal had the teen counselors singing psalms set to guitar. Also, we talked about Biblical stories after meals and said prayers before bed. Still, I was more drawn to the zipline and the rodeo at the end of the week, but some of those psalm-songs were pretty cool, and when I went back the next year, I took a bit more interest in the Bible study sessions, but still, it was mostly about the summer camp stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
    Not too much later, my dad's work moved us, and when we got there, we just never found a church. It was thanks to a few things: my grandmother moved in with us, my dad's job got busier, and frankly, Christianity, was not all that central to our family. Looking back, I bet my folks thought that taking your kids was something you were supposed to do if you didn't want your kids to turn out screwed up. Anyhow, the next time I bumped up against religion with any seriousness was when a friend of mine from back in Dallas was in town. He's about 6 years older than me, and I had always looked up to him as "the cool older kid." To be fair, he never blew off the hero-worshipping little kid down the alley. When I saw him in Virginia, he had gone to college, and I was in junior high, and I found out he had gotten pretty deeply into Christianity, which was a bit of a shocker. See, this is the guy who introduced me to Magic: the Gathering. He was a nerdy, smart guy into the nerdiest sorts of gaming. The other gamers I hung out with and looked up to were all some flavor of skeptical or hostile to traditional religion. My friend showed me a model of a smart person who nevertheless believed, and that made an impression on me.

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga94f258">
    <p>
    Well, not too long after that, as you might not be shocked to hear, there was a girl. My first girlfriend was a Wiccan - not just adolescent rebellion, since her mom and stepdad were Wiccans, but it was still a bit shocking/weird back then. She loaned me some of the books, which spoke to my fantasy-loving heart, but I didn't get that much into them. As teenagers are wont to do, I copped some poses about the crushing weight of Christianity, but never really went anywhere past that.
    </p>

    <p>
    We moved again, and as you might expect for a couple of 15 year olds, our vows of undying long-distance love didn't last all that long. For the rest of high school, religion wasn't that big of a deal for me. My new girlfriend had a similar bland, respectable Methodist background. One of my friends was the son of a Methodist preacher and himself a youth pastor, but mostly we quizzed each other on obscure Tolkien trivia. I had set aside the Wiccan stuff and fallen back on "Christian, I guess", if not just vaguely agnostic. It wasn't that big a deal in my life, but I didn't truly ask much about it.

    My freshman year of college, I became friends with a senior. We hit it off immediately, found that we had rather a lot in common, and we're still good friends eighteen years later despite his career taking him all over Asia with visits home to the states, few, far between, and mostly dedicated to family. This friend was my second example of someone intelligent, nerdy, and thoughtful who took Christianity seriously. He organized a Religious Studies reading group that I participated in, and I joined him in laughing at some of the excesses of the Neopagan scene described in <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>, debating some of the metaphysical shortcomings of hardcore dualism, but most importantly for my own development, engaging seriously with C.S. Lewis's arguments in <i>Mere Christianity</i>. Here was a rationale for Christianity that was even stronger than the two positive models in my own life: an atheist who had come by it the hard way, intelligent, thoughtful, extremely knowledgeable, and making arguments that were <i>not</i> some variation of "because this infallible book says so". I found it very compelling and launched into a briefly strong interest and belief in Christianity that slowly faded into something I consciously believed, but did not have much bearing on my day to day life.
    </p>

    <p>
    During my time in the Army, religion didn't play much of a role in my life (oddly enough, it tended to pop up at times like right before jumping out of an airplane - "no atheists in foxholes" and all that). I wore a medallion of St. Michael the Archangel that some organization gave me (he's the patron saint of paratroopers - he descends from the sky and kicks ass, you see), but it was mostly a good luck charm and not much more.

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7fc337c">
    <p>
    From there, I got out and went to business school and then started working as a management consultant. Somewhere amidst the travel, the attempts to analyze and optimize everything, and struggling to work out whether what I was doing "actually meant anything, really" my belief in anything transcendent collapsed. I became more and more attracted to hardcore rationalists who were unapologetically scientific materialists (to borrow a jokey distinction from Neal Stephenson, not meaning that they were really into BMWs and fancy watches, but that they believe that the material world of the senses is the only one there is). For a time, this was exhilirating and liberating: if I'm not constrained by some arbitrary rules handed down from iron age tribesmen and the Hellenistic prophet who made a few changes, then morality, meaning, purpose, they can all be whatever I want, right?
    </p>

    <p>
    Obviously I was retreading the same ground that Nietzche, the existentialists, and others had attempted, and you might not be too surprised to learn that it ended up leading to aimlessness and depression. That approach was also just <i>terrible</i> at dealing with some of the actually bad shit that came down the road, like my healthy, non-smoking mom being diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer and my wife suffering a miscarriage. So, I had been convinced that this world and life was all there was, but trying to work out belief and meaning from scratch wasn't going so hot.

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org805998b">
    <p>
    For dramatic purposes, I've held off introducing some influences that I really encountered earlier, but this is where they truly became significant. I began to take far more seriously Jung's contention that mythology contained deep psychological truth and meaning encoded in symbols and "beings". I thought something like "well, 'gods' may not actually be magical dudes and ladies floating out there in the sky or an alternate dimension, but they might actually be useful, nuanced personifications of inter-related concepts, impressions, and feelings, and religious ritual might be an empirically-proven technique for interacting with these aspects of the subconscious". <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html">This essay</a> by the old-school hacker and polymath Eric S. Raymond is a pretty good explanation of the concept, and might be the first place I encountered the idea. It will also come as no surprise that this led me to find rather a lot of value in Jordan Peterson's material (at least, if you've engaged with him at any level beyond "is this guy the devil?"). His work really helped me get a more intuitive grasp of the archetypes and how to recognize them in stories and mythologies, along with what they're doing in our subconscious (for example, using archetypal analysis helped me figure out some of the weirder ends of my sexual fantasizing over the years. No I won't tell you what it was).
    </p>

    <p>
    As you might have guessed from my interest in fantasy fiction and games, I've always been fascinated by mythology. I first encountered the idea that myths could encode sophisticated understandings of the world in a chapter of Stephenson's <i>Cryptonomicon</i> where a character explains how the story of the conception of Erechtheus actually says a lot about the nature of money. I've since come to figure out that that whole section was a rehashing of Jung, but hey, it succeeded in making the point very clear. Through much of the time I considered myself a Christian, I would say things like "if I got to pick what I believed, I'd believe in the Norse Gods. Valhalla sounds like a pretty rad afterlife." Now I was in the position of actually believing that I <i>could</i> choose what to belief, since I figured that any system of practice reasonably grounded in what we knew about actual ancient polytheist religion would work as an interface with my subconscious. So I started saying prayers to the Norse Gods. Again, I basically believed I was talking to subconscious processes put in place by evolution, but I also believed that might turn out to be useful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Well, for a while I kept going through the motions, waiting for the results I expected. While an intellectual understanding of the archetypes was proving very useful in extracting significance from literature and mythology, my prayers and rituals (practiced alone, and though with regularity, not particular energy) were not really doing much for me. So, when my mom died and we had our first daughter not long after, I tried to keep up with these practices for a while, but they fell by the wayside, which was okay, because I was fine. I had whiskey.
    </p>

    <p>
    According to my wife and family, I was not fine. Sure, I was mostly keeping up with my job and being a new dad, but I didn't seem myself, and I didn't seem okay. I responded as many folks do: no, you're wrong, I am okay, and I'm going to go back to my whiskey. I eventually agreed to see a therapist, mostly to placate my wife, and that has been helpful, but didn't have as much to do with my spiritual development as some other things (if your friends or family tell you they think you should talk to a therapist, consider giving it a try - you don't have to go back if you don't like it!)

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org610da94">
    <p>
    Not to put too fine a point on it, but the "other things" were drugs. Likely not exactly how you think, though. A few months after my first daughter was born, I went to a friend's bachelor party. While there, I tried LSD for the first time. I had been reading and listening a lot about psychedelics and their potential for psychological growth and healing, and I wasn't especially interested in it as a "party drug", so I was a bit surprised that my first encounter was pretty much that. Part of what convinced me was that the fellow who brought it is knowledgeable, careful, interested in the spiritual/psychological uses of the drug, and a medical professional to boot. So I started out with a half dose, didn't feel much of anything and took another half dose, and ended up having a pleasant, but fairly minor experience, with some bendy wood grain and my face looking odd in the mirror, followed by a complete inability to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
    What the hell does that have to do with my spiritual development? Well, not much. If anything, I was a bit disillusioned with the transformative promise I had built up in my mind for psychedelics. But it was enjoyable and I hadn't experienced anything remotely approaching the negatives people warn about, so when a few months later some friends of mine invited me to take some mushrooms on a camping trip, I said "that sounds great". This time, I was more comfortable with taking a bigger dose, we were in beautiful natural surroundings, and I was entirely with some of my closest friends, rather than a mixed group of folks I know well and not so well. Well, again, no ground-shaking insights, but I had an <i>extremely</i> pleasant afternoon where I enjoyed the sights, sounds, and feelings of a cold stream on a hot afternoon in the woods with my friends. I did have a small insight, as I was "coming down", though. For those of you who have never experienced it, one of the weirder things about psychedelics (apparently mushrooms even more than LSD) is that as they start to wear off, it comes in waves - you feel euphoric and things are moving that you know aren't really moving, and then a moment later everything is normal, and you think "oh, okay, I guess that was a fun ride that's over, now", but then you start noticing some weird stuff again. They're like waves that gradually reduce and go back out to sea. Well, this effect was far more noticeable than on my prior trip, and so I found myself wondering "how will I <i>really</i> know when it's over for good?" Oh, I should have mentioned - these drugs also reeeaaallly mess with your sense of time. But in the midst of "is this it? Whoah, guess not. Wait, is this it <i>now</i>?" I came to the realization that it didn't really matter when it ended, because the value of the experience had been independent of its finitude. A concept I had encountered plenty of times in Taoist and Buddhist philosophy, but not one that I had really "grokked" without some chemical help.
    </p>

    <p>
    Okay, okay, I know, that starts to hint at something vaguely spiritual, but it doesn't really have to do with religion, does it? I had to lay out the first two experiences for the third (and so far, last) to make sense as a crucial step in my journey. As I mentioned, I had had some hopes about psychedelics before trying them, and so far, my experiences had veered far more to "a good time with my friends" than "mind-expanding insight that shakes your beliefs to their core". So when the next opportunity presented itself at another campout, I pursued the straightforward strategy of <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/more-dakka/">"more dakka"</a>. I took a medium size dose of mushrooms, and an hour or two into that, I took a dose of LSD, and within an hour of that, I took another. Well, much of the experience was as before: me discoursing at greater than necessary length on the military history of the Roman empire, giggling uncontrollably at fart jokes, staring transfixedly at natural beauty. At some point, though, I laid down and looked up at the stars, and as they began to dance and swirl and resolve themselves into crystalline patterns, three major things happened: 1) I felt overwhelming, but ultimately positive, grief about my mother, 2) I had an insight about thinking versus feeling, and 3) for a moment, I lost my usual sense of "self" without being unconscious.
    </p>

    <p>
    Point number 2 was largely brought about by point number 1, and is the main one I want to focus on here, though point 3 might have some interesting implications to dive into at some point. My whole life I've been a "smart guy" - I started talking early, I read above my age level, I got put in gifted and talented classes as soon they were an option, and so on and so forth. Most of the problems in my life had been the kind that smarts make easier: once you understand <i>how</i> something works, you can often "skip to the end" without doing the intermediate steps. If someone is trying to illuminate a concept through examples and the first two make it clear, you don't need the next five. If I can toot my own horn, I'm especially good at this kind of inferential thinking, so I've sought out situations in life where I can excel by being good at it. Well, the powerful grief I felt for my mom on this trip made me realize that this was a trick I had learned to over-apply throughout my life. I thought that because I "understood" my grief, I was done. I could skip right to the end of moving on, with occasional sadness. That realization made me realize I do this <i>all the time</i> - "oh, I understand that working out is important for being happy and healthy, that's the same as actually doing it everyday, right?" That's an intentionally ridiculous example when put explicitly, but some part of me more or less thinks this about <i>anything</i> where the experience, the <i>doing</i> of it is more important than understanding it in principle.

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9a31c45">
    <p>
    Okay, so thank you for bearing with me for that brief foray into psychedelic "trip reports", which are <i>always</i> less compelling to literally everyone else than the one who experienced them. Back to your regularly-scheduled examination of intellectual influences. So, here I was doing better psychologically and personally - I wasn't drinking so much anymore, I was doing even better as a dad, taking care of more things around the house, seeming more myself, all that good stuff. So I wasn't any more interested in spiritual topics like philosophy, mythology, religion, and so forth than I always had been when I read a book called <i>World Full of Gods</i> by John Michael Greer.
    </p>

    <p>
    My best friend from the Army introduced me to Greer a few years back, and <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/">some of his writings</a> had been interesting and useful to me from the standpoint of approaching religion as an exercise in archetypes, which at this point in our narrative, was still what I believed, but I wasn't very actively practicing. <i>World Full of Gods</i> sets out to make a case for polytheism, and to greatly boil down a well-written and argued book, it rests on two main arguments against atheism: 1) most atheist arguments against religion are hopelessly tangled up in its history of arguing against culturally dominant monotheism (mostly Christianity, with a side helping of Islam in more recent years), 2) the scientific materialist worldview underlying most atheism rests on a key premise that is not self-evident. I found 1) interesting, but less important, as I was already largely comfortable with the idea that "religion" need not necessarily mean "Christianity" and most of the arguments that had brought me along to atheism had relied less on "the argument from evil" ("how could an ominibenevolent, omnipotent, omniscient God allow evil to exist in the world?") and more on "things that don't cash out to verifiable predictions about the material world aren't falsifiable and so can't be usefully reasoned about".
    </p>

    <p>
    It was the second argument that got me thinking. Greer argues that the worldview of scientific materialism is based on a fairly simple premise: the only things that count as "real" are those things sensed by the five senses. This sounds pretty uncontroversial at first glance, especially in our modern society, where the scientific materialist worldview is so much the default. Notice a few things that are left out, though: imagination. The experience of feeling something. Thoughts. Now, sure, you can arrive at approximations of these things that are sensible to the five senses: I can think words in my thoughts and then type them into my laptop, put them somewhere that you can see them with your eyeballs, and if you and someone else read this, you can both be pretty confident that I thought these words, and since words and letters have a pretty tight correlation, that's likely pretty good. But what about less clear cut cases? If I describe to you (to borrow another image from Stephenson, this time from <i>Anathem</i>) a "purple nerve-gas farting dragon", it seems rather likely that an image pops into your head of what this creature might look like. Does it look the same as the one I'm imagining? Much harder to say. Maybe if you and I are both accomplished artists, we might draw what we see in our minds eye and compare those drawings, but that wouldn't capture the emotional associations you have with the image (funny? scary? a blend?). Even if we hooked both of us up to the most advanced neuroscanners ever invented and had both of us imagine the dragon, the sameness or differentness of the shapes or lines on the screen wouldn't tell you what it was <i>like</i> to imagine the dragon.
    </p>

    <p>
    Okay, I've treated the argument fairly briefly here, and maybe not to your satisfaction, but basically as Greer presented it was enough for me to go "huh, okay, some parts of human experience that seem wildly important and self-evident aren't actually adequately grounded out in what is traditionally considered falsifiable." You may or may not be with me on this point, but for now, we'll proceed with the narrative as if <i>I</i> found it convincing at the time, because I did (and still do). Greer then points out that almost every human culture for all of human history has had experiences in this non-sensory realm (or at least, partially in this realm) that they regard as self-evident and obviously real, and these experiences are of various beings that have various levels of personhood, power, and knowledge, and may or may not be tied to material things like trees, rocks, animals, and so forth. Basically, it boils down to this: the claim that religious experiences are "just in your head" ignores the crucial importance of "just". It is weighted with tremendous metaphysical load - if something happens in your imagination it is not "really real".
    </p>
    </div>

    <li><a id="org438c1db"></a>Then I Saw Her Face, Now I'm a Believer<br />
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org438c1db">
    <p>
    So, I now had a profound personal insight I am bad at things that are not intellectually, linguistically describable, and an intellectual argument that this blind spot might be exactly where religious experience happens to live. I decided to conduct an experiment: I would resume prayer and religious ritual, along with a new practice called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/tag/discursive+meditation">"discursive meditation"</a>, and as far as I was able, I would try to believe the Gods to whom I was praying and about whom I was thinking were "really real" even if my only experience of them would be "in my head", and I'd see how it went for a while. The short answer is that about two weeks after starting this experiment, I had a profoundly strong religious experience of being visited by a Goddess and briefly hosting a God. It was amazing, wonderful, and utterly recognizable to anyone who has read about religious experiences. It was at once one of the most singular experiences I've had and also completely mundane to most humans for most of human history.
    </p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
    <li>Maybe a little bit more on what came of that</li>

    </li>

    <li><a id="orga601469"></a>Hold on to What Your Believe<br />
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga601469">
    <p>
    Okay, so if you wanted to pin me down, what do I truly <i>believe</i> now, today, as of this writing? Well, first and most importantly, I believe that what you <i>do</i> is far weightier than what you <i>believe</i>. By which I mean that I don't put a lot of weight on what thoughts you (or I) hold in your (or my) head about how Life, the Universe, and Everything tick. Letting myself be open to the ontological reality of non-physical consciousnesses outside of my body might have been a necessary step to getting where I am, or it might not have been. Sitting my ass down and bethinking on the myths was <i>definitely</i> needed to get me where I am. So while I am going to try to give as short a run down of what I believe as I can, I want to put the warning ahead of it that it is subject to change and far less important to me than keeping up with prayer, ritual, meditation, and divination.
    </p>

    <p>
    That first point stems from the next biggest chunk of my belief, which I've also gotten mostly from Greer: the cosmos is way bigger and way weirder than our social primate brains can ever hope to understand with any great fidelity. Even the bare fact of how <i>big</i> all the stuff outside of the Earth is, how <i>truly</i> far away it is, is <i>literally</i> unthinkable - we can't know it, the best we can do is approximate. So if physical reality is that hard to understand, the spiritual realities that underlie and go beyond it must be even more unfathomable. Once again, the best we can do is get the rough shape of it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Speaking of "getting the rough shape of it," despite the inadequacy of our current state of development for <i>truly</i> understanding Being, I also think that we <i>can</i> get glimpses of what's going on under the hood of material reality through a variety of spiritual practices. I think that every long-lasting spiritual tradition has had some insight into the eternal truths of the universe, but nothing so simplistic as "all religions are basically the same." Instead, since all of Being (including its spiritual elements) is big, weird, and complex, I think that different spiritual traditions get glimpses of different bits of the unfathomably complex big picture. Think the wise men and the elephant, and that's pretty close.
    </p>

    <p>
    For my own practice, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/">gnosis is far weightier than episteme</a> - as I said above, I can't truly ground my religious experiences, including the first big one, in any kind of "proof" that would mean anything to anyone else, or even to myself, intellectually. I have to rely on the experience itself. If I've had a meaningful experience that makes me and my life better, well, what else do I truly need to know about it? The flip side of this, of course, is that these experiences have been <i>mine</i>, and I don't presume to put them on anyone else. By the same token, if other folks have their own, wildly different, spiritual beliefs/practices/experiences, who am I to tell them how to think/feel about those?
    </p>

    <p>
    Okay, okay, I hear you asking "yeah, but what do you <i>believe</i>?" Again, with the caveats above in mind, let me try to do the best I can. I think that all of the cosmos is a manifestation of something divine, and that consciousness is in some sense primary to matter. I think all consciousness is a part of that fundamental divine, but it is importantly differentiated. Something like how Niagra Falls, Lake Erie, the Niagra River, and Lake Ontario are all a part of the same system of water, but each has its own differentiated reality. I think some of these differentiated manifestations of consciousness sometimes embody themselves here in the material plane as sundry beings, and that some manifestations of consciousness don't need material bodies. The former would be "lifeforms" and the latter would be "Gods, spirits, and so forth."
    </p>

    <p>
    I find <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-occult-philosophy-workbook-a-one-year-course-in-the-secret-wisdom-john-michael-greer/18532301?ean=9781801520119">old school occult philosophy</a> a helpful way of making sense of the world if you accept the reality of non-physical things and of certain weird phenomena that folks have been saying happened to them for hundreds, or even thousands of years, but that the modern materialist worldview says are just plain wrong (see ghosts, for one). This provides a framework for making sense of some of the above. Gods, Goddesses, spirits, and so forth are beings that exist on non-material planes and mostly interact with us through our presence on non-material planes. Maybe the most important of these for religious practice is the astral plane - the realm of imagination, desire, and visualization. The short version is that I think Gods, Goddesses, and Spirits mostly take up shapes/sounds/emotional impressions on the astral plane as a way to interact with us on a level we can all access. Do Gods sometimes take on material forms? Maybe, I've never met one! But I find the idea of astral imagery and it sometimes being "inhabited" a useful one.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's do an example. Do me a favor and picture a burly, red-haired, thick-bearded man with a big heart. He loves his wife and his kids, he has a great thirst for ale and hunger for meat, and his temper is a bit short. He's good at fighting, and mostly he's not angry about it, he finds it joyful. But his wrath is terrible when awakened, even if it passes quickly. As you might suspect if you've been reading me for any amount of time, I just described (some of) how Thunor/Thor is usually imagined. Now, if I say "picture this feisty red-haired warrior smashing some trolls with his hammer," you likely don't have a very strong religious response - you don't feel the presence of the divine/numinous, even though you can clearly see in your mind's eye Thunor smashing some trolls. Certain occult traditions would call this mental image an "astral vehicle," and as this example likely makes clear, it's at least somewhat generated individually - I may have described some features to you, which means I shaped the image, but you did the actual imagining, and if we could somehow print out your mental picture and mine, they would almost certainly differ, even though a third person might look at them and think "they were going for the same guy." Well, I think that when you pray, do rituals, or otherwise seriously engage with religious practice, you bring your own imaginings, likely informed by a tradition of what to imagine, to the table, but then to the degree it is a true religious experience, someone else breaths life into that imagining. So if I just ask you to imagine Thunor with the above characteristics smashing trolls, likely nobody's home but your own imagination. On the other hand, if you earnestly pray to Thunor, light a candle, give a drink offering, and quiet your mind waiting for a response, when a mental image pops up of Thunor giving you some advice, that might be your imagined image ("astral vehicle") being animated by an actual outside-of-you non-physical consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since I believe in benevolent non-physical consciousnesses, I have to admit to the possibility of malevolent ones too, and everything in between. While I think there are very powerful non-physical beings on our side (Gods, angels, spirits and such), I also think there are a lot of more middling ones that surpass us in some ways and are less than us in others who are more ambiguous, and then there must be some very bad beings that again, surpass us in some ways, but are less than us in others. The word you may be stopping yourself from thinking for this last group is "demon." I don't know that I've ever met a full-on demon, but it seems naive to suppose that every serious religious tradition on the planet is just wrong that there are some non-physical beings out there who are bad news and best avoided.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anyhow, the benevolent non-physical beings that I feel the greatest kinship to are the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, most of all as seen through an Anglo-Saxon lens. I can't really explain this, except that they speak to me aesthetically, and I've come to believe that that's an under-appreciated aspect of religious feeling: what do you find beautiful/gripping/moving? I've come to have great respect for the Jewish and Christian religions, their teachings, and ceremonies, but imaginatively they leave me cold. I think that's a reasonably good sign they're not for me - at least not right here and right now. But that in no way means I think they're invalid for everyone (see above about <i>gnosis</i>) - if anything, I'm far <i>more</i> sympathetic to religious Christians, Jews, and Muslims (and every other major religion) than I was when I was a materialist.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also suspect that reincarnation is a big part of how the world works. I don't have any past-life memories or anything, but thinkers and writers I respect say they do, and spiritual traditions that include reincarnation have proven worthwhile to me, and there are a <i>lot</i> of traditions that feature reincarnation. I was <i>shocked</i> when I finally got around to reading Plato's <i>Republic</i> last year to find near the end a detailed description of reincarnation. Somehow, the fact that literally the <i>most famous work in all of western philosophy</i> talked in depth about reincarnation was unknown to me - not only an educated person, not only a liberal arts major, but a <i>Classics</i> major - I studied Greek and Latin history, culture, and literature! Obviously I did a crap job if I got through college without reading <i>Republic</i>, but still, I hadn't even <i>heard</i> of the <a href="https://www.philosophybro.com/archive/platos-the-myth-of-er-a-summary">"Myth of Er"</a>. Once I did read it, though, I was like "holy shit, how did I have no idea that the West's most famous work of philosophy talks about reincarnation? It must just be me." And so I went online to see what scholars thought. And you know what I found? A bunch of folks trying to work out what Plato/Socrates meant allegorically, metaphorically, and so forth (that link above continues in this vein). Basically <i>no one</i> took seriously the idea that Plato/Socrates was trying to relate something about how the world actually works. So anyway, I don't have strong evidence for reincarnation or anything, but once you start poking around, the belief in it is <i>way</i> more widespread than you might think if you've grown up with an American protestant worldview.
    </p>

    <p>
    So, what falls out of all of the above? I believe that there is more to me and to you than our bodies. We have an everlasting soul that was around before we were born and will be around after we die. Other non-bodily Beings are trying to either help or hurt these souls on our way. Those souls come down in the material world to learn its lessons life after life, and all of us will eventually learn every lesson we need, moving on to some new way of being. There are some practices, like religion, magic, and so forth, that can help you learn some of those lessons faster and less painfully. Pretty much all religious folks are onto at least a portion of this, but none of us have the whole picture - as such it pays to be open-minded and welcoming to religious folks, but also not to be too shaken by meeting folks who practices are very different from your own.
    </p>

    <p>
    Part of why I've gone into all of this is because these days, most folks either have no religious belief at all or very superficial beliefs. There are very clearly a lot of problems that stem from that, and some folks look at those problems and conclude that the way forward can only be a return to traditional (meaning Christian, at least in America) beliefs. Since those traditional beliefs don't especially resonate with me, I've wanted to share that there are at least a handful of weirdos with strong, sincere religious beliefs that might have more in common with traditional beliefs than most old school Christians would initially grant. I like having the freedom to practice my own <i>very</i> idiosyncratic religious pursuits rather than having that baby tossed out with the bathwater of materialist agnosticism and atheism. In other words, theists of all stripes: I am your friend! There's a bunch of weird stuff out there, and while some of it is very bad, not all of it is.
    </p>

    <li><a id="org5850c72"></a>Don't Stop Believin'<br />
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5850c72">
    <p>
    Since then I've kept up the prayer, ritual, and meditation, and it has continued to be hugely beneficial to me. I don't feel like I have all the answers, far from it, but I do feel like there's <i>something</i> meaningful and worthwhile beyond myself and my day-to-day concerns. So I consider myself a believing polytheist these days, which would have been pretty shocking to me even a couple of years ago. The experience of things so flatly denied by the worldview I held then has been rather a shake-up: I have to rethink my views on rather a wide range of topics, since my nuts-and-bolts ideas about what's "really real" have taken a substantial adjustment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course, I'm also left with the lingering doubts you might expect. Hell, that you might be feeling as more forcefully than "doubts" right at the moment: isn't it more plausible this is some kind of wish fulfillment? Just because it's common throughout history and across cultures doesn't mean it's accurate - it could just mean our brains are all fundamentally flawed the same way. Even if you're convinced of something religious, isn't polytheism primitive or unsophisticated? If you start taking unverifiable thoughts too seriously, isn't that called being crazy?
    </p>

    <p>
    To all of which I can only respond that some part of me acknowledges the possibility of any of those being true. The <i>whole reason</i> scientific materialism grounds out in the five senses and is suspicious of what can't be verified by them is because you can arrive at much more definite, easier-to-agree-upon conclusions. And the stuff that you can figure out with those more definite conclusions is pretty damn impressive. See: twentieth century physics. It's a useful way of thinking that has done a lot of good for the world, and I'm by no means saying that anyone should abandon the methods or hard-won insights of such careful thinking. What I am saying is that since I have allowed myself to take more seriously those parts of my experience that are not fully describable/verifiable by such thinking, I have been happier and more fulfilled, with a greater sense of meaning than I've ever experienced before. So, if it is a delusion, it's an awfully useful one.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll leave you with the ancient wisdom of otherworldly gurus, wise sages, and elder hackers alike: YMMV.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2023-June-25
  </p>

  <p>
  Ever since I read this <a href="https://terminalvelocity-rpg.blogspot.com/2021/11/freight-rates-and-what-they-mean-for.html">post</a> about what the cost of freight says about your
  sci-fi setting, I've been thinking about what it means for the real world. If
  you don't care about sci-fi world building, don't worry, that's not where I'm
  going with this, but here's what the post does: it spells out what the world
  would be like with cheaper or costlier shipping . If you have very cheap
  freight, you move all kinds of things between worlds. If freight is dear,
  though, you only ship the fanciest things - if you're gonna bring food, it might
  as well be steak and lobster. Interesting enough if you're a writer or building
  an RPG setting, but what does that have to do with the this world right here?
  Well, it seems to me that when folks talk about the industrial revolution, they
  always talk about <i>production</i> and almost not at all about <i>distribution</i>. This
  might be a mistake - I'm starting to think that cheaper shipping has had at
  least as much to do with making the industrial world as mass production. Maybe
  somebody else has already done this to death, so if you happen to know of any
  books that talk about this, kindly let me know, as I'd love to read them.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is a big, hairy topic, and one I'm likely to come back to, but I wanted to
  think out loud a bit and see if that gets me anywhere. First off, let me lay out
  an important premise underlying what follows: whatever else the industrial
  revolution has been, it is <i>mostly</i> the story of energy becoming <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">insanely cheap</a>
  (Tim Urban is rather more sanguine on future energy than I am, but he does a
  good breakdown on the history). For most of human history, the most energy we
  could harness was putting a mill near a waterfall, but over the course of the
  19th and 20th century, we found fossil fuels and worked out how to burn them to
  make stuff happen, and we're still burning them like crazy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so I bring up energy and the industrial revolution - what's the first
  thing that comes to mind? Factories, right? True, steam power, and later
  electricity, allowed for cranking out a lot of stuff with a lot less human
  input. Undoubtedly, this is a big part of the story, but I think we all know it
  pretty well. What we think about less is how did all of this factory-made stuff
  get to where it was going?
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's do a little thought experiment. Imagine you live in a town ringed by
  impassable mountains. Everything the folks of the town need gets made here, all
  business stays within these mountains. If you were to build a factory that can
  make 100 widgets for every one the storied widget master craftsman can turn out,
  who is going to buy them? Now imagine a pass gets blasted and there are dozens
  of towns now within a day's ride. All of a sudden, the factory seems like a
  better deal, right? This is basic supply and demand stuff, but the heart of the
  idea is that productive capacity is only as useful as the size of the market
  that can/will buy what it makes.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can likely see where I'm going with this. With steam ships, rail, and later
  trucking, the whole world became the market for things made anywhere. Economies
  of scale do more for you when you can sell to such a large market. It used to be
  that most folks could afford to have all of their furniture hand made out of
  real wood - since every village had a woodworker. Nowadays, mass production plus
  long-distance shipping means one factory in China can spit out furniture for
  millions of people. Thanks to fossil fuels, that's way cheaper than having some
  dude down the street do it, so the only handmade furniture is super high-end
  Amish stuff that you have to take out a second mortgage to buy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Take pretty much any craft that used to be done in the neighborhood and cheap
  shipping has wrecked it.
  </p>

  <p>
  But it's not only about shipping <i>stuff</i>. As the writer of the sci-fi post points
  out, above a given shipping price, you don't get space truckers, you get
  astronauts: if mass is expensive, you want the chunks of mass you have to have
  (read: the crew) to be as useful and worthwhile as can be. It turns out that
  shipping workers, or at least their work, has all kinds of knock-on outcomes. I
  first came across the bearing of transportation and communication on work in
  <a href="https://www.drorpoleg.com/rise-of-the-10x-class/">this post</a> by Dror Poleg. As with Tim Urban, let's set aside where Poleg thinks
  things are going and zoom in on some of the history he shares instead. Late in
  the 1800s, some economists began to mark some changes to some jobs, but not
  others. For one thing, most musicians and other performers began making less
  money, but a handful started making <i>way</i> more - for the first time, there were
  "stars". What had happened was that performers could now cheaply and quickly get
  around the country. Those who were very good started drawing crowds wherever
  they went. So, if you were the best singer in New York, now you could also be
  the best singer in Philadelphia and Washington and so forth. Great news for the
  star! But what about the best singer in Washington? Maybe she's not as good as
  the New York one, so whenever New York comes down to sing, that lady is no
  longer the best singer in Washington. Before trains, every town needed singers,
  and all of them could do okay. But with trains, fewer singers could give a
  bigger market what it wanted, and that heated up the competition between all
  singers, with a few winners and lots of losers. And that was just from <i>trains</i>.
  Once we got recordings and broadcast, that competition got taken to 11 - since
  it became <i>even cheaper</i> to "ship" the "product."
  </p>

  <p>
  For me, that story unlocked the thought that making it cheaper to reach a wider
  market can lead to a lot of unforeseen outcomes. Once I found that lens, I have
  found it helpful to look at all kinds of things with it.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, take suburbia. You can talk about all kinds of things that added to
  the trend for a bunch of folks to start living in a way no one else has for all
  of human history, but you can say one thing for sure: you can't have suburbs
  without a cheap way to get into the city. Sure, some early suburbs came about
  once trains became common, but it was the widespread adoption of cars that made
  suburbia mushroom through such a wide swath of the US. As the performer example
  above showed, though, it's not only moving the person doing the work, it's
  moving the product as well - and these days, most knowledge work can be done
  remotely, which is even cheaper than commuting. We know what knowledge work
  looks like when the worker can't zoom into the city from miles away in a car or
  Zoom into the meeting from his laptop - you get a bunch of scribes and clerks.
  Read some Dickens to get the idea.
  </p>

  <p>
  It's not just work, either.
  </p>

  <p>
  It used to be that if you wanted to talk to folks, you had to go to the bar or
  the Loyal Order of Water Buffalo lodge or wherever. These days, you can just get
  out your laptop and hop on Discord or Slack. Not only do you have more folks you
  can talk to, you can talk about <i>whatever</i> you want - you can get down into some
  very weird, very tiny little niches and find folks that care about your weird
  thing as much as you do instead of struggling through listening to your neighbor
  talk about whatever dumb thing he cares about. As I hinted when I <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#cows_don_t_know_what_s_best_for_them">talked about
  cows</a>, it might be that all of this unfettered choice has some downsides. Maybe
  the <a href="https://www.alibris.com/Bowling-Alone-The-Collapse-and-Revival-of-American-Community-Robert-D-Putnam/book/783607?matches=146">dwindling of our sundry clubs, lodges, and groups</a> is not as much about the
  weakening worth of our folk as it is that doing something else is just <i>too easy</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I don't really know what could or should be done about some of the downsides of
  cheap freight, most of all since it seems like the more I look at it, the more
  things it touches. As I said above, this might all be well-trodden ground, so
  maybe others have already come up with thoughts on how to handle all of this
  (again, if so, kindly let me know). For now, this is more of a thread I'm
  picking up on when I come across it than something I'm going to buckle down and
  dig deep on - so, look for more thoughts on this, but I don't know when.

  <title>The Trouble with Authenticity</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-June-18
  </p>

  <p>
  I've been letting my thoughts about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9ZPa4vleiU">authenticity</a> and how we should think about
  it when it comes to belief simmer for a while now. I've gone from giving
  authenticity nearly the top spot for working out what to believe and how to
  worship to now giving it a much narrower job. I think a lot of us grapple with
  authenticity in belief, but I've yet to see anyone go over it as thoroughly as I
  might wish. Luckily, I read something the other day that helped untangle what
  had been holding me back. To get there, though, let's lay some groundwork.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org03f6901"></a>Authentic Things Come From Where They Say They Do<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org03f6901">
  <p>
  First off, what are we even talking about when I say "authenticity?" A lot of
  folks have meant a lot of things by this word, so I'm going to borrow a way of
  pinning it down from one of the works that has shaped my thinking, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/a-few-words-about-authenticity/">this post
  from John Michael Greer</a>:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Authenticity is a matter of whether something has the source it claims to have;
  validity is a matter of whether it works.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  See that word "validity?" Keep it in mind for later, as it's the supporting
  actor to our star. For now, though, you can see this meaning of "authenticity"
  rests on <i>where</i> did something come from, and a bit less so on whether the
  wellspring from which it comes has the right to bestow the name it calls itself.
  Here's a couple of somewhat silly examples: Greg Graffin starts a new band, and
  it doesn't sound much like Bad Religion, but he says "this is punk rock." Most
  folks would go "okay, yeah, I can hear that." On the other hand, some unknown 15
  year old gets together four of his best friends, they learn to sing in lovely
  harmony, and they put together some stunning dance moves that dazzle all the
  girls in their high school, but since their oh-so-harmonized and
  carefully-choreographed lyrics are about anarchy, they say that what they're
  doing is "punk" - we might not be as likely to go along with that.
  </p>

  <p>
  Or take something near and dear to my Texan heart: chili. If your Texan
  grandmother learned how to make chili from her range cook daddy, even if she
  does something most folks don't with chili, we're not gonna fight her when she
  says "this is real chili." If a hip Paris chef dreams up a brand new spicy vegan
  soup and calls it chili, we might feel a little otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
  What I'm getting at here is to build on Greer's meaning a bit: our high school
  friends could say "we're punk because our friend Bill said we are," which might
  be wholly true. Their punk brand comes from Bill, so they have the source they
  say they do, but for us to work out whether we <i>buy</i> it, we have to know who Bill
  is and what makes him a rightful giver of the much-sought mark of "punk."
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so are we on the same leaf about what we mean by "authenticity" for
  today's talk? Good. Now that we know what we're talking about, we get to an even
  weightier asking: why do we care? Isn't it kinda open-and-shut that it's a good
  thing for something to come from where it says it does, and for that somewhere
  to be somehow rightful? As you may have gathered from the name of this post, I
  <i>don't</i> think it's open-and-shut, but authenticity <i>can</i> be very helpful, so let's
  take a moment to talk about what authenticity can do for us.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org6a86797"></a>Folks Use Authenticity as a Shortcut for Validity<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6a86797">
  <p>
  At its heart, authenticity is a rule of thumb for working out whether we can
  <i>trust</i> someone or something - is he who he says he is? Did folks truly believe
  this stuff back in the day? If a work tells you what to do or how to be, by what
  right does it do so? Put bluntly, things that are not authentic are often <i>lying</i>
  somehow. If a set of teachings doesn't truly come from where it says it does,
  how do you know whether anything else in those teachings is true? If the
  wellspring of a belief is somehow not rightful (legitimate), then maybe that
  belief isn't either. And if a belief is new, how do we know what effects it will
  have on those who adopt it in the long run? I've stated all these as problems
  with the inauthentic, but lets put them positively for the authentic: ideally, a
  tradition or set of beliefs that is authentic should come from where it says it
  does, that source should have some claim to validity with regard to its
  teachings, and ideally, the tradition holding these teachings going back to this
  source should have been around for a good, long time to see how it responds to
  the world as it actually is, rather than as its imagined.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is all rather airy, so let's come down to ground a bit. Take Catholicism.
  Catholicism says that it is the body of beliefs, practices, and teachings that
  began with Jesus Christ, as built on by the Church for the last 2,000 years.
  Now, as for the wellspring, of course some folks don't think there was a living,
  breathing man named Jesus, much less that he was the son of God and God Himself
  in the flesh. But we do know that at least that in the first hundred years CE, a
  new set of beliefs and worship got started in Judea and began to spread around
  the Roman Empire, and that all of today's Christians, including the Catholic
  Church, can follow an a unbroken path back to that set of beliefs and worship.
  How about rightfulness? Well, clearly not everyone acknowledges the rightfulness
  of the Catholic Church to settle things about Godlore (exhibit A: Martin
  Luther), but the Church <i>does</i> have a long-running and fairly readily grasped way
  of working out who gets to say authoritative things about the Church,
  understanding of holy writing, and changes to ways of doing things. And again,
  there's a clear throughline for this way of doing things going back 2,000 years.
  Therefore, most folks would have very little trouble acknowledging mainstream
  Catholicism as an "authentic" set of beliefs. Even if you don't think they are
  <i>right</i>, you also likely don't think they are <i>fake</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the other hand, let's take Scientology. The wellspring was a fairly, but by
  no means wildly, well-known and well-liked mid-twentieth century science fiction
  author who said that he gained insight into the make-up of Being while working
  with folks through a kind of therapy he had worked up. Said author was heard by
  friends and family talking about how religion was the way to make money.
  Sometime later, after a bankruptcy, he shifted from calling his therapy a
  scientific way to a spiritual one, and was hit with a handful of criminal
  charges as his new church grew. Said church was officially incorporated as a
  religious organization in 1953. The way the church works out who gets to make
  settle what is religiously true, how those settlements get made, and even what
  those settlements are is well-known for its murkiness and kept to a narrow group
  of folks high up in the church. From all this, many folks (myself included) do
  not see Scientology as all that authentic, whatever else it may or may not be.
  I'll leave it up to you whether the rule of thumb "don't trust Scientology since
  they seem not to be authentic" is worth following here, but I know where I land.
  </p>

  <p>
  I want to talk more about <i>why</i> we are so keen to look at authenticity as if it
  were validity, but first I want to talk a bit about some of the turns my own
  spiritual path has taken thus far and what it has taught me about authenticity
  and validity.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgc87648d"></a>But Authenticity Doesn't Wholly Get At Validity<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc87648d">
  <p>
  Okay, so we've laid out how authenticity can be a helpful shortcut for thinking
  about some of the things we care about in weighing a religious or spiritual
  belief. To get at why I think authenticity is not <i>enough</i> by itself, and
  sometimes needs to give way to some other ways of judging a set of teachings,
  though, I think it will be helpful to talk a bit about what I've done and where
  authenticity has fit in with that.
  </p>

  <p>
  As you may <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">remember</a>, not so long ago, I was a pretty won over by atheistic
  materialist. If you pushed me, I'd say that I didn't know for sure, and there
  wasn't really any way to do so, but it was smarter to start out needing to be
  talked out of the thought that there was nothing but the material world, rather
  than the other way around. Even though (because of?) this, I still found myself
  drawn to myth, magic, and other spiritual things, most of all the weirder stuff.
  Then, an <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/dancing.html">essay</a> by a thinker I had long looked up to, Eric S. Raymond, helped
  bring together some fuzzy hunches I had into a way of looking at the world that
  hung together. Namely, that religious or magical practices <i>might</i> do <i>something</i>,
  whether or not the metaphysics behind the ritual were what they said they were.
  For one materialist take on how magic might "work," even if not in the way or
  for the reasons thought by those doing the magic, check out this <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/06/19/the-use-and-abuse-of-witchdoctors-for-life/">tale of
  invulnerability potions against bullets in Africa</a>. Anyhow, I reckoned that if
  magic was good enough for arch-materialist Raymond, it was good enough for me,
  and so I had "permission" to check out magic and weirdo religion while keeping
  my rational materialist way of seeing myself and the world.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, the frame through which I looked at this stuff was something like this: 1.
  almost all humans in all steads for all time have had some kind of
  magical/religious ritual, 2. ritual seems to do <i>some</i> good things that you can't
  get without it, and 3. ritual seems to reach the nethermind (subconscious) in
  ways that don't always make sense to the speaking, wakeful (conscious) mind. In
  this frame, it seemed straightforward that I needed a set of practices that 1.
  spoke to me aesthetically, as that would shape how strongly my nethermind would
  answer to it, 2. that fit with Jungian psychology, which seemed to have the best
  grasp on the very deep, dark places of the mind, and 3. came from a time and
  stead in the past that took it seriously, since that ought to mean it works.
  Well, listing these benchmarks make it sound like I went through some
  thoroughgoing search, poking and testing myth and magic from around the world,
  but no. Instead, it was always clearly Germanish myth. Even when I was Christian
  back in college, I would "joke" that if Christianity weren't true, I'd want to
  go to Valhalla. Luckily, all elder polytheistic sets of beliefs fit with Jungian
  psychology and had been held by large groups of folks, any of them would have
  met those benchmarks. That being said, as you might have gathered from what I
  said about Raymond's work above, I had landed on what some folks mean when they
  say "soft polytheism" - I thought that the sundry Gods, Goddesses, and other
  beings were sub-processes of my nethermind shared with the rest of mankind.
  Powerful? Yes. Maybe scary sometimes? Yes. "Real" in any way other than "all of
  mankind evolved these same personified shapes of thought?" Not so much.
  </p>

  <p>
  On that footing, I started doing a lot of reading - learning the myths, reading
  about what today's worshippers did, and a <i>lot</i> about the Runes. Whenever a writer
  grounded what he was talking with the Gods as "really real," I'd say to myself
  "yeah, sure thing, buddy," but even though I didn't think their way of
  understanding the world was right, I worked to keep a fairly open mind to the
  thought that they might know a thing or two about how to get the outcomes I
  wanted. So, I started saying prayers. I started giving beer to the Gods and
  wights (spirits). At some point, I read <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/how-not-to-learn-magic-an-introductory-note/">this</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-ritual/">set</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-meditation/">of</a> <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/foundations-of-magical-practice-divination/">essays</a> by John Michael Greer
  about what's needed for a well-rounded daily magical practice. Once again, I
  thought his thoughts on <i>what</i> to do would be helpful, but I didn't buy <i>why</i> he
  thought it worked. One bit of rede (advice) he gave was to "pick a course of
  magical study and do it 'by the book' start to end," rather than making changes
  or cobbling together your own thing. This seemed fair to me, so I started in on
  the <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-nine-doors-of-midgard-a-curriculum-of-rune-work-revised-and-expanded-5th-with-new-preface-edred-thorsson/8994649?ean=9780971204485">The Nine Doors of Midgard</a> from the Rune Gild. I bethought (meditated). I
  prayed. I cast the Runes. I did daily Hammer Rituals. I followed everything the
  book said to do.
  </p>

  <p>
  All along the way, when it came to weighing what to bring into my understanding
  of the myths or into my practice, authenticity seemed like the only way to work
  out what was worthwhile or not that made sense. What do the writings from the
  middle ages say? What does archaeology tell us about the practices of Iron Age
  Germanish folks? Was this practice a later borrowing from Christianity, or a
  heathen practice that kept going into Christianity? Anything that smacked of
  being lately made up, borrowing from other folkways or sets of teachings, or
  lacking tokens that it was thought or done in the Iron Age or early middle ages
  was <i>at best</i> a patch to fill in the unlucky gaps of a wondrous, fully authentic
  reconstruction of the beliefs of elder times.
  </p>

  <p>
  There was just one problem.
  </p>

  <p>
  It felt <i>wholly</i> like talking to myself. I'd say prayers and get no answer, not
  even a feeling or hunch I could put down to my nethermind. I'd do rituals that
  didn't seem to do anything and I didn't feel anything while doing them. The one
  bit that did seem to be working was Runecasting. I would get some insights on
  the things I asked, but it felt more like seeing something more clearly that I
  already knew than like tapping into a spring of timeless wisdom. I kept on with
  the practices for a while, hoping I'd get to where they did <i>something</i>, but
  between my mom dying and my first daughter being born, it got harder and harder
  to spend 30-45 minutes of my day talking to myself, until I just stopped.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the meantime, I had kept on reading Greer's blog, <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net">Ecosophia</a>. Here was this
  guy following a rather <i>inauthentic</i> religion*, Revival Druidry, seemingly in full
  earnest, calmly and unruffably putting forth the literal, non-metaphorical
  reality of non-bodily thinking beings like Gods, and <i>yet</i> on everything else, he
  kept on making sense. His takes on what happened in the past and why it came
  about were insightful and even-handed. On politics, he was good at spotting what
  was wrong with every side of a given issue. On spiritual matters, his rede was
  always down-to-earth, principled, and clearly wise. So, I thought "why not read
  his book on many-godded (polytheistic) godlore, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-world-full-of-gods-an-inquiry-into-polytheism-john-michael-greer/18731823?ean=9781801520805">World Full of Gods</a>." As I've
  talked about <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#org385e1cb">elsewhere</a>, this book shook my atheistic materialist worldview and
  made me wonder if maybe the trouble with all the practices I had tried was that
  I <i>knew I was faking it</i> the whole time.
  </p>

  <p>
  *(Speaking on behalf of Greer, he has never said that his religion goes back to
  pre-Christian druids of Celtic lands, and as the leader of the Ancient Order of
  Druids in America, he made that straightforwardness the official policy of the
  organization. So <i>he</i> has always spoken of his religion authentically, but for
  many years, Revival Druids <i>did</i> say that they were the holders of a set of
  teachings from elder times.)
  </p>

  <p>
  So, I told myself I'd do an experiment. I'd spend a few weeks, maybe a few
  months, being at least <i>open</i> to the thought that the Gods were really real, not
  just archetypes, not just tides of the nethermind, but Beings outside of me with
  Their own goals, ends, and so forth. I once again took up JMG's "magical
  tripod," this time with his <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/26433.html">Heathen Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram</a>
  plus <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/31086.html">Heathen Middle Pillar</a> for my ritual, some guided threads on the Runes from
  <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-teutonic-way-magic-kveldulf-gundarsson/14479256?ean=9781989033265">The Teutonic Way: Magic</a> for bethinking, and a daily Runecasting for divination.
  The practices weren't that unlike what I had tried to do with the <i>Nine Doors of
  Midgard</i>, but the mindset very much was.
  </p>

  <p>
  Think on my shock when, after two weeks of this, I have a very strong religious
  experience, with shaking and tingling all over my body and leaving me with an
  unshakable ecstatic feeling. I won't share the details, as it was very personal,
  but it's enough to say that I had set myself an experiment to see if "openness
  to the existence of the Gods" shaped the outcomes I got from religious and
  magical practice, and this was a screaming, blinding "YES!" that I couldn't
  overlook.
  </p>

  <p>
  I said the practices weren't that unalike, but did you heed something I slipped
  in there? These practices were much less <i>authentic</i> - The Lesser Banishing Ritual
  of the Pentagram is a Golden Dawn ritual, which drew heavily fromn Eliphas
  Levi's rituals in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-doctrine-and-ritual-of-high-magic-a-new-translation-eliphas-levi/11711532?ean=9780143111030">The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic</a>, which was itself a
  re-working of Renaissance magical practices, which mostly derived from Late
  Hellenistic practices, which said they came from Egypt, who got them from the
  God Thoth-Hermes. The Middle Pillar exercise is built on the Tree of Life of the
  Cabala, which again, the Golden Dawn made heavy use of thanks to Levi bringing
  it back, after it had been used widely by Renaissance Christian occultists, who
  got it from High Medieval/Renaissance Jewish occultists, who re-worked it from
  earlier Hellenistic Neoplatonic models, who got it from who knows where/came up
  with it.
  </p>

  <p>
  Notice what's missing? <i>Anything at all to do with Iron Age or early middle ages
  Germanish practices</i>. The only link was that in these rituals, I called upon the
  names of Germanish Gods, brought to mind things from Germanish myths, and
  visualized the Runes at some steps. And yet these practices led to a
  life-changing happening and a seemingly-abiding shift in metaphysical outlook.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, clearly, authenticity wasn't the end-all, be-all I had thought it to be.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org894320a"></a>We Put a Lot of Worth on Authenticity as a Terminal Value Since It Feels Grounded<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org894320a">
  <p>
  So how did I, along with many others, end up seeing authenticity as <i>the</i> way to
  weigh the worth of spiritual teachings and practices? Well, one thing is that if
  you aren't following the religion that you grew up with (and at some point,
  maybe even if you are), you have to work out "why do I believe this and not one
  of the zillions of other religions out there?" This is a struggle that most
  folks in most times have not had to deal with - you believed whatever your folk
  believed, the end. Today's world gives us the freedom to do otherwise, but with
  the high cost of working out what to believe, why to believe it, and what to do
  with it. Authenticity is one way to go through the beliefs out there and clump
  them together or pull them apart. As such, authenticity can work as a benchmark
  for <i>categorization</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Now, categorization is very helpful - it's one of mankind's key thinking skills,
  and a lot of what we have done is built on it. So I'm not crapping on
  categorization. The trouble is that there is not, and never can be, a way of
  categorizing that is not grounded in some sense of what is more (and what is
  less) <i>worthwhile</i> - in other words, in <i>values</i>. Scott Alexander has a classic post
  on this called <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">The Categories Were Made for Man, Not Man for the Categories</a>. You
  should read it, but one of the long-running examples in the post is the made-up
  struggle of a Biblical-times Judean working out what category to put a whale in.
  Folks today see a whale called a "fish" in the Bible and think "hahah, how
  stupid, a whale is so clearly a mammal! Those backwards dopes!" Alexander,
  though, talks us through <i>why</i> that seems so clear to us and wouldn't even have
  occurred to some of the folks in Judea. Bring to mind, if you will, a Judean
  functionary given the task of gathering taxes and tariffs on seafood brought in
  by fishermen. When one of these fishermen brings in the biggest damned flippered
  thing ever dragged out of the ocean and is ready to make his riches by carving
  nearly endless filets off of its bulk, do you think our tax collector friend is
  going to find it very funny when the fisherman says "that's no fish, it's a
  mammal!"? Likely not, right? If you mainly care about understanding a whale by
  what other animals does it share the closest forebearers with, then a cladistic
  understanding that Whales are mammals that went in the water and turned all
  funny is helpful. On the other hand, if you want to make sure that the king gets
  taxes on every swimming thing that folks haul out of the water to eat, and the
  law says to tax "fish," you better believe it's more helpful to think of the
  whale as a fish (to you, in that stead, in that time).
  </p>

  <p>
  What makes this still tougher, though, is that authenticity works <i>both</i> as a
  benchmark for "does belief A belong in this category or not?" <i>as well</i> as a
  grounding for worth (authentic is better than inauthentic). If it's only <i>one</i>
  such weight of worth, then okay, no trouble. But what about when you give it the
  <i>last</i> say on what is worthwhile and what is not? What if it becomes your <i>terminal
  value</i>? Working out how to think about terminal values is <i>hard</i> - you can't see if
  it brings about some other good, you can't weigh it like something with a body -
  everything else you deem worthwhile grounds out in your terminal value. If you
  want more of a feeling for how hard this is, see <i>all of Western philosophy</i>.
  Really. It's that hard. But authenticity makes for a welcoming terminal value,
  most of all to Americans of this day and age, and so many of us find ourselves
  building our other values off of it, without knowing that's what we're up to.
  How come?
  </p>

  <p>
  I think there are three main things that lead us to turn to authenticity as a
  terminal value, most of all for spiritual things. Going roughly from what we are
  most aware of to what we're least aware of. First, authenticity feels like a
  terminal value you can get behind pretty strongly, even with a wholly
  materialist outlook. Did this set of teachings come from where it said it did?
  If yes, huzzah! It's worthwhile. If not, great! Into the bin with you! Either
  way, no need for metaphysical hoo-hah. Now, of course, if you have two teachings
  that both come from where they say they do, how do you pick between them? What
  makes one better than the other? Are the teachings from Tibet in 1400 CE better
  than the ones I came up with last week? How come? Both come from where they said
  they do, so how do we tell them apart? Whoops, looks like you have to use some
  values besides authenticity. Oh well.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, authenticity is <i>deeply</i> interwoven with how the West has always dealt with
  spiritual validity. I hope I'm not shocking anyone when I let slip that for a
  little more than a thousand years, if you were in the West, and you wanted to
  know "is this spiritually valid?" the answer was mostly "well, what does the
  Bible say about it?" Yeah, yeah, I know, there was a lot more to it than that,
  most of all before the Reformation, and most Christians did not take the Bible
  as literally as some fundamentalists do today, but even still, all valid
  spiritual truth was seen as coming from God, and the Bible was seen as the word
  of God, so almost all askings about spiritual validity came down to whether they
  were backed up in the one authentic wellspring of truth, the Bible. I think that
  this habit of thought and belief has become very deeply impressed in our psyches
  and ways of thinking about things. If I can bring up another Greer work, we
  greatly prefer <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/blogs-and-essays/the-well-of-galabes/gnosis-doxa-and-episteme-or-what-kind-of-knowledge-do-you-mean/">episteme over gnosis</a>. Many "free thinking" pagans, New Agers, and
  whatever else have traded one "only well-spring of all truth" for another.
  </p>

  <p>
  And the last that I'd bring up, the one of which we're least aware, is that I
  think authenticity soothes our roaring insecurity. Thanks to modernity, and
  globalization and what not, everyone has somewhat had to deal with feeling cut
  off from deep, true beliefs and folkways. As I said above, most of mankind to
  ever live just believed what their folk believed, their folk had believed it
  since before anyone could remember, and what they believed was linked with the
  lands where they lived. There was a weight and a depth there, such that a lot of
  practices kept on well past when anyone knew what they meant or why they did
  them, but that was just how it had always been, and so they held onto some
  strength. But modernity has messed with all that, and in America, it's hard to
  say that the non-American Indians <i>ever</i> had that. We're a new country full of
  folks who just got here, if you take a wide enough outlook, and deep down, we
  all know this. So I think we seek what feels grounded, and authenticity does, at
  least sometimes.
  </p>

  <p>
  In hindsight, what has dawned on me is that the harder someone leans on
  authenticity to prop up his religion, the more likely he is <i>LARPing</i>. Now, I've
  been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151123053702/http://brunching.com/images/geekchart.pdf">looking down my nose at LARPers</a> for a good, long time, so I'm not using
  this because it's become a more common phrase lately, I'm putting forth a true
  likeness. Both LARPers and hardcore reconstructionists might like what they're
  doing, they might get great gladness from it, it might be a big and weighty bit
  of their life that furthers some of their closest bonds - but deep down, both
  know they're <i>pretending to be something they're not</i>. Kidding aside, playing
  pretend is a deeply human thing to do, and I'm not crapping on it, but it is not
  what everyone is looking for from a religion, and I bet that many folks either
  hope that it will work notwithstanding misgivings, or else tell themselves
  that's not what's happening and act like everything's okay.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org5b4b5fc"></a>Instead Authenticity Should Shape and Hold Up Validity - But Not Stand In For It<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5b4b5fc">
  <p>
  And yet&#x2026; Didn't folks in elder times have understanding about things we don't?
  Didn't they grow up Heathen (or Pagan, or truly Orthodox, or whatever), take it
  as given, live and breath it? Didn't they live before modernity choked the life
  and <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/the-nature-of-enchantment/">enchantment</a> out of everything? Didn't I say that authenticity helped us
  avoid fake, bad stuff? So, why should we strive for authenticity as a way to
  learn from them and do what works? Maybe LARPing something authentic is better
  than earnestly believing something fake?
  </p>

  <p>
  Now we have at last gotten to the insight that let me write this work. I was
  reading a book review by Charles Haywood of <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2017/10/25/book-review-augustus-first-emperor-of-rome-adrian-goldsworthy/">Augustus: First Emperor of Rome</a>,
  which went some ways I wasn't exactly looking for in a classical history book
  review. Towards the end, he works out his own meaning for "reaction" as its own
  thing that isn't "conservatism." Don't worry, I'm not getting political here,
  just bear with me a tick! He sees conservatism as trying to hold onto what we
  already have that's good - straightforward enough. "Reaction," on the other
  hand, he sees as seeking some kind of big change, grounded not in theory or
  ideology, but rather in what has worked in the past to get the kind of outcomes
  wanted. Something new built out of bits of the past, you might say. This struck
  me as rather like how I have come to look at cobbling together a meaningful
  religious practice outside of an settled set of ways, teachings, and beliefs. I
  had started with "stick with what worked in the past!" (That is, always go for
  authenticity.) A time came when I saw that wasn't working and I needed something
  new. I could tell, though, that making something up from whole cloth was very
  unlikely to work that great, and might instead go terribly wrong (think
  "Heaven's Gate" or "Jonestown"). So, rather than go with something wholly old,
  or wholly new, I found a way to look to what had worked in the past, pick the
  bits that fit in with my overall aesthetic, ethical, and religious outlook, and
  give them a try. Maybe the weightiest change, though, was I now had seen and
  felt what it means for a religious practice to have <i>validity</i> with or without
  authenticity - I knew what it felt like when it <i>worked</i>. This has been a game
  changer, when put next to the stumbling around pretending I was doing as a
  materialist.
  </p>

  <p>
  (By the way, I found Haywood and his book reviews when I was looking for
  podcasts with/about JMG and found the audio version of his review of <a href="https://theworthyhouse.com/2021/01/01/retrotopia-john-michael-greer/">Retrotopia</a>,
  so synchronicity, mayhaps?)
  </p>

  <p>
  If I might say so, I think my work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> fits this way of doing
  things pretty well. I have looked to the past for templates, like the Rosary
  itself, the Germanish poetic meters, the imagery and symbolism from the myths,
  and so forth. But I'm tweaking and putting together and cutting based on prayer,
  intuition, and seeing what works and what doesn't. I have no illusions that
  anyone in 5th century England prayed anything like this, nor do I think it will
  look much like the Catholic Rosary when I'm through, either.
  </p>

  <p>
  The thing is, though, I don't <i>care</i> that it's not what was done in the past. I
  care whether I find the <i>heart</i> of what has made these myths echo through the ages
  and this way of praying have such deep spiritual outcomes for so many. Gods
  willing, and with help from you reading this, I'll find a way to make something
  that partakes of the deep worth of these models and brings them to some folks
  who wouldn't have found it otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
  That's the goal anyway: not to be authentic, but to be <i>true</i>.

  </p>

  <p>
  If I had to put how this book made me feel into one word, that word would be
  <i>maddening</i>. Not since it has nothing of worth - oh no, that would be far less
  wrathsome. Instead, the book is <i>very</i> uneven, some ways shallow, but some fairly
  deep. I now have deeply mixed feelings about buying in one go all of the "Odhinn
  Trilogy" of which this is the first volume. Even still, I think if I come at
  these books like an archaeologist, brushing aside the midden and the sherds to
  find the riches buried within, I might find them worthwhile nonetheless. So!
  This rundown of the book is my first step in shaking out the wheat from the
  chaff, but also I just <i>had</i> to get some of this off my chest, so I am sorry if I
  get a bit heated at times.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org51cc170">
  <p>
  Here's how Shani Oates <a href="https://www.anathemapublishing.com/shani-oates">tells you who she is</a>:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Occultist, Mystic, Luciferian Pilgrim of the Forbidden Arts, Traditional Craft
  Practitioner, researcher, lecturer, historian, and writer of the Craft, Magic,
  Ancestral Tradition, particularly the Robert Cochrane Tradition, and the
  cultural Folk-lore and Folk-magicks of the Uk and its Northern Heritage.
  Spae-wife and Matriarch of The People of Goda, The Clan of Tubal Cain. Student
  of Anthropology, Tantra, Philosophy, and the arcane ‘Other.’
  </p>

  <p>
  Author of several books that write informatively on the myths, gods, and
  archetypes that imbue and inform the Cults and Crafts of Witchcraft and
  Folk-Traditions, shifting through the arcane to modern times.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  The word that really jumped out at me, and gave me some pause in ordering this
  book at all, is "Luciferian." Now, in case you don't know, we're not dealing
  with "literal Devil worship" here, necessarily. "Luciferian" is one of many
  titles that folks in the Western Esoteric Tradition use to describe themselves
  if they are on the "Left Hand Path" (not to be confused with the "Left Hand
  Path" of Tantric Yoga/Buddhism, but there are <i>some</i> similarities). I'm not that
  knowledgable on this stuff, but I've gathered a bit. The most sympathetic way to
  put what the "LHP" is about is seeking knowledge and enlightenment <i>whatever the
  cost</i> - schools of thought within the LHP argue that social norms, taboos, rules,
  strictures, and so forth, are all obstacles to true, cosmic knowledge, and that
  such things must be set aside to learn the deepest secrets. This tends to come
  bundled with radical individualism and an ethos of seizing things through might
  and daring. The better sort of LHP folks carefully wall-off all of this
  taboo-breaking, seizing-by-might stuff in ritual contexts and acknowledge that
  rules, restrictions, and norms are <i>mostly</i> very helpful, even if the path to
  enlightenment sometimes involves breaking them. This better end of things often
  looks rather like "shadow work" in a Jungian framework - acknowledging the
  darker bits of yourself and working to make them a bit of the whole self. One
  author I still draw on a lot who has been an avowed member of LHP organizations
  is Edred Thorsson (Dr. Stephen Flowers) - many Heathens found out about these
  associations and grew suspicious that his work was "tainted," but for myself,
  I've learned to recognize when he starts veering into more LHP stuff and to
  quietly set that aside, then get back to the good stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
  Anyhow, that's the <i>ideal</i>, but I have picked up from <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/">John Michael Greer</a> a general
  policy of not associating with LHP folks and to cast a suspicious eye on their
  thinking and works. All that stuff about radical individualism and breaking
  norms to attain the highest kinds of enlightenment? That sounds pretty good for
  <i>the person doing it</i> (or at least it might, to some kinds of folks, and I'll
  admit, I have some of those tastes). But what about everyone around that person?
  What tends to happen almost every time is that folks who enthusiastically
  embrace an LHP ethos end up as world class jerks. At a minimum, they want to be
  seen as the rebels they long to be, so they will push and push until the folks
  around them get sick of it and push back, at which point they get to say
  something like "I knew you guys were just part of the Man!" and storm out in a
  rebellious huff. I don't personally have any experience with magical groups, but
  I've met folks like this, and it's a pattern I recognize, so I'm happy to borrow
  JMG's experience here and assume his rule is a sensible one.
  </p>

  <p>
  Now, all that being said, I get the impression that Ms. Oates is at the better
  end of things, and that her LHP lens doesn't change <i>everything</i> in the book. But
  there are some times where it jumps out, and it's a bit tiresome. Here's some
  chapter titles that give you a taste: "Gold Mead: Elixir of Forbidden
  Enchantments," or "Yggdrassill: Dread Steed of the Damned." Now, as we'll cover
  below, she does have <i>some</i> reason to refer to what Odhinn is doing as "forbidden"
  and him as "damned," at least in her interpretive framework. But still, don't
  these strike you as just a bit "Hot Topic"? Throughout the book, there are hints
  of this wallowing in the grisly and shocking, which is <i>maybe</i> sometimes helpful
  for such a challenging God as Odhinn, but mostly strikes me as childish.
  </p>

  <p>
  Another bit of her background that seemed relevant to me is her Wiccan grounding
  (that's what "Traditional Craft Practitioner" means). Wiccans believe that all
  Gods are one God, and that all Goddesses are one Goddess, and the God and the
  Goddess coming together in a sacred marriage is one of their core symbolic
  images. This means that 1. Wiccans can be a bit quick to equate one God with
  another, if they happen to both be men (or women), and 2. They can tend to see
  any contact between a God and a Goddess as "truly" being a <i>hieros gamos</i>, a
  sacred wedding - yes, this is truly a widespread and weighty mythic element, but
  it's not literally <i>everywhere</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Lastly, I hate to say this, as this work (and the others) show a great deal of
  time and sweat put into them, and clearly Ms. Oates is more widely-read in the
  lore than I am, but some of her writing style and way of doing/sharing research
  had me literally yelling foul words at the book, and I'm not proud to say, at
  her. First off, she <i>way</i> over-uses the passive voice. This would be annoying to
  me, as I teach Business Writing, and pretty much the main commandment there is
  "Thou shalt not write in passive voice." What makes it <i>far</i> worse here, though,
  is sometimes it actually makes things substantively harder to understand - "it
  is regarded" - by whom? By you? By most scholars in the field today? By
  worshiping heathens? By the sock puppets you talk to? Also, footnotes are
  sometimes sloppy - like putting a foot note at the end of a quote that <i>doesn't
  give the source of the quote, but rather a thought about it</i>. Or, putting the
  abbreviated citation in a footnote, and then leaving that work out of the
  bibliography (such as "See Kiessey (2005)," and then there's no "Kiessey" in the
  bibliography!). Or, gesturing at an <i>entire book</i> after giving a <i>direct quote</i>,
  rather than giving a page number. What made this especially maddening is that
  often I <i>wanted</i> to follow up more, because it was an interesting point that
  seemed to come from an interesting work. Also, though I talk about this below in
  the bit about editing, there were many times where Ms. Oates used words in ways
  that are just wrong, like "exorcise his authority." She also uses academicese
  less than perfectly. The overall impression I got was of someone trying too hard
  to impress the reader, which is a shame, since there's plenty of worthwhile
  stuff in this book that would be impressive enough if written straightforwardly.
  Here's a bit from the conclusion that shows many of the above points:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  All conclusions grow out [of] a subjective experience. It is our contention,
  therefore, that this body of work can only be drawn together by the threads
  woven in life as it is known, and therefore bound within the parameters of
  understanding.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  What does that even mean? Is she trying to say you can only make sense of this
  work by relating it to your own life and experience? I guess.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgeaaec46"></a>The Main Thrust<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeaaec46">
  <p>
  Okay, with all that out of the way, let's talk about what Oates has to share.
  This is the first book of three that Oates has written about Odhinn, and she
  plans on writing even more about the "Northern Otherworld." The focus of this
  one is on Odhinn's links with death and what seemingly unalike bits of myth have
  to do with one another. She puts forth that Odhinn's "hanging" is best
  understood not as hanging from the neck until dead, but rather a kind of ordeal
  by suspension with sacrifices of men and animals (that <i>are</i> hanging from the neck
  until dead) in the trees/on poles all around him. Hanged men <i>are</i> somewhat
  identified with Odhinn, as they become "his," but she does not believe his
  "hanging form a windy tree" was <i>literally</i> a sacrificial hanging - instead,
  Odhinn's true self-sacrifice is at Ragnarok, when he is eaten by Fenris. One of
  the more interesting claims in the book, and one that I don't know that I buy,
  is that Odhinn's <i>Einherjar</i> (chosen slain warriors) were understood as the bodily
  undead <i>draugr</i>, and that <i>Vallholl</i> is best understood as inside grave mounds,
  filled by these <i>draugr</i>. The myths of Odhinn gaining various kinds of knowledge
  (which she insists on identifying as "taboo" and "forbidden") are given their
  meaning by Odhinn's sacrifice at Ragnarok - getting eaten by Fenris is the
  payment for his forbidden magics and knowledge, and it's a price he pays
  willingly to make sure that Gods and Men make it through to the other side.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgfe8d032"></a>Some Other Things I Found Interesting<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe8d032">
  <p>
  Now I'd like to share some of the things I found interesting or maybe worth
  looking more into, but these are not all that organized. In the long run, I
  think these bits are more likely to be what sticks with me from the book and for
  me to build on with later reading.
  </p>

  <p>
  For one, her discussion of grave mounds and <i>draugar</i> brought in <i>a lot</i> of
  references to widely-spread sources, so I'm thankful for that road to go down
  for further research. What was <i>also</i> interesting to me about these bits was how
  they called to mind John Michael Greer's book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/monsters-an-investigator-s-guide-to-magical-beings-third-edition-revised-and-expanded-john-michael-greer/17445432?ean=9781913504588">Monsters</a>, which gives a thumbnail
  history of a practice spread across all of Eurasia of building mounds so that
  the spirit of a dead ruler could stick around to help out, and how this practice
  devolved into vampirism. Digging in there might be worthwhile whether or not the
  conclusions she draws about the <i>draugar</i>'s links with Odhinn pan out. I think she
  is slightly off in emphasizing the corporeality of the <i>draugar</i>, as Greer's work
  offers what I find a more satisfying explanation: the beings that once haunted
  grave mounds are <i>etheric</i> mainly. This is one of many steads where old school
  occult philosophy helps make sense of things that are otherwise puzzling. Very
  briefly, the etheric plane is the plane of "life energy," and it is the
  "closest" to the material plane. Etheric material is usually unseen and freely
  interpenetrates physical matter, but certain practices and conditions can render
  it able to interact with matter. This is why ghosts can sometime affect physical
  objects but also can go through walls. The various things <i>draugar</i> are said to do
  all make sense if they're etheric, rather than material, and grave mounds were
  one way elder folks kept the etheric body alive after material death. One more
  fun thing: in the same book, Greer argues that dragons are likely best
  understood as ethereal beings, and links modern lake monsters like Nessie with
  the dragon tradition. Oates talks about how some mound-dwellers became dragons
  in Norse stories - so, that'd be a cool link, if right.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, the next thing I found interesting actually <i>does</i> come out of her
  overly-left-hand-path framing that I mostly don't buy, but I think it can still
  make sense outside of that frame. As I said above, she says that some of the
  magic and knowledge Odhinn gains truly are <i>forbidden</i>, even to the king of the
  Gods, and that nobody gets to use them without paying a price, and Odhinn's
  death at Ragnarok is that price. What she links this with, though, is the
  thought that Baldr's death was his way of getting around that - since Baldr
  would ride out Ragnarok in Hel, he would be around to lead the Gods in the new
  world to come after. I'd seen the idea that Baldr's death was somehow needed, so
  that he'd be around after Ragnarok, but not that Odhinn made it happen to ensure
  the preservation of the Godly order of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
  Of especial interest to me given my ongoing work on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> was
  Oates's discussion of the three times Odhinn gained knowledge, and what links
  them thematically. I've been looking into these three myths a lot lately as I'm
  getting started working on a new version of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">All Father</a>. The three myths I
  mean are when Odhinn gets the Mead of Poetry from Gunnlodh, when he drinks from
  Mimir's Well of Memory, and when he gains the Runes by hanging upon "the tree."
  Oates puts these into a progression of sorts - the Mead of Poetry is the raw
  inspiration, Mimir's Well gives the memory and skills needed to best use that
  inspiration, and the Runes allow it to be shaped to magical ends. I was groping
  toward a similar understanding, but this gave me some good stuff to work with.
  </p>

  <p>
  Speaking of Mimir, there was a lot of interesting stuff about him in this book.
  For one, remember how I said that Oates links Odhinn with the mound-dwelling
  <i>draugar</i>? Well, something that happens in more than one saga is that someone,
  usually a descendant of the lord buried in the mound, goes in there, fights the
  <i>draugr</i>, cuts his head off, and then takes his sword. She argues that this was a
  way of "claiming an ancestral birthright," but it had to be earned through the
  combat. Building on this, she makes the case that Odhinn beheaded Mimir (rather
  than the Vanir after they learned Hoenir was dependent on his counsel), and that
  this was a way of taking ownership of Mimir's gifts, knowledge, and power. She
  also clearly laid out something I have run into before, but didn't know it's
  grounding: why folks say that Mimir might have been Odhinn's mother's brother.
  It's <i>Havamal</i> stanza 140:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Nine mighty songs<br />
  I learned from the great son of<br />
  Bale-thorn, Bestla's sire;<br />
  I drank a measure of the wondrous Mead,<br />
  With the Soul-stirrer's drops I was showered.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  I'm a bit embarrassed I hadn't caught that one myself before, but thank goodness
  I know now.
  </p>

  <p>
  She gives the meaning of <i>Idhunna</i> as "Oldest/First of all mothers," which is very
  interesting for my own thoughts about Her, but this is one of those maddening
  times that she <i>doesn't explain herself or cite anyone at all</i>. Maria Kvilhaug
  gives a very different meaning to her name, as "Goddess of the Field of Water
  Sources," and she is kind enough to spell out why and how she got to that
  meaning. Altogether, I felt like her handling of Idhunna was fairly
  disappointing. As my work on the Heathen Rosary makes clear, I have found a bond
  between Idun and Woden that rings true to me, so I'm always interested when
  other folks talk about that. Here, though, I think that Oates maybe goes too
  far, as she states that Idhunna is all of: The Well of Wyrd, the World Tree, the
  Sun, Mother Earth, and Fate. I think she has important links with all of these
  concepts (and I'll admit, I may not have been giving her turning into a wolf in
  <i>Hrafnagaldur Oðins</i> enough weight), but to say that she <i>is</i> all of these things at
  once seems like too much conflation to me.
  </p>

  <p>
  Speaking of Fenris, one bit that I still don't know how to feel about, but I
  find interesting, is that Oates argues that Odhinn's steed is not a horse, but a
  <i>wolf</i>, and that that wolf is, wait for it, Fenris. Now, there is definitely
  something interesting going on with Odhinn and wolves, but this one seems to
  flat out go against what it says in our best sources, where we have the tale of
  Fenris's binding and the siring of Sleipnir by a <i>horse</i> explicitly.
  </p>

  <p>
  She also has a nice take on poetry and why it is so centrally important to
  Odhinn and his followers: as a tool of memory, it preserves stories, it carries
  forward the deeds of the past and stops them from being forgotten. As such, it
  is a tool of Order in the never-ending fight against Chaos. I don't think she
  explicitly made the same claim for Runes, but it seems like they would have a
  similar weight, as a way of writing down what has happened. We tend to take
  records of the past for granted these days, but the fact that folks could know
  what had happened before the memory of anyone alive, or even their grandparents,
  must have been more clearly seen as the deep magic it truly is by those who had
  not been numbed by familiarity.
  </p>

  <p>
  Oh, and on the Runes, one of the few mentions the Futhark gets (as opposed to
  the Rune songs spoken of in <i>Havamal</i>) is to link each of the three Aetts with one
  of the three drinks Odhinn took (she assumes, as do I, that some kind of drink
  must have been involved in the winning of the Runes, though it's not spelled out
  as clearly as with Gunnlodh and Mimir). I haven't put much thought into this one
  yet, but I bet it will be good fodder for bethinking (meditation).
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org41d82af"></a>The Book Itself<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org41d82af">
  <p>
  This is not usually something I would talk about when going over a book, but
  here I think it's warranted, both good and bad. First off, the good stuff:
  Anathema Publishing specializes in limited runs of <i>very</i> nice hardcovers, but
  they have branched out a bit to also offer merely "nice" hardcovers and even
  paperbacks of some titles, though a recent news post has me thinking they might
  be pulling back from that strategy. At any rate, I got the "Standard Edition"
  hard cover of this book, and you can tell that they take the craft of book
  binding seriously. It is a lovely book - nice, thick paper, exquisitely printed
  text, quality binding, understated but classy cloth covering with an embossed
  bindrune. I'm a bit of a typograpy and printing nerd, and so I appreciate this
  stuff, even if I'm not much of a book "collector." So that's all great!
  </p>

  <p>
  Unluckily, that's not all there is to say about how the book was made. It seems
  that in their focus on book bindery, Anathema is <i>not</i> quite as obsessive about
  some of the other services publishers offer their authors and readers. Like copy
  editing. There are a lot of typos, and some of them <i>render the meaning
  ambiguous</i> - like no "not" where you're pretty sure it should be there, but the
  sentence <i>kinda</i> makes sense without it. Also, Ms. Oates has several instances
  where she uses a homophone or nearly soundalike word where something else is
  clearly meant - such as "exorcise his authority." (Lit nerd time: these are
  known as "malapropisms" after a character, Mrs. Malaprop, in Richard Brinsley
  Sheridan's 1775 play <i>The Rivals</i>). A good editor would have caught at least most
  of these. I was all ready to decry Oates's use of "self-immolation" for Odhinn's
  hanging himself as "a gift of myself, to myself," since I always thought
  immolation implied the burning up part of Classical sacrifices, but it seems I
  was wrong on that count - immolation is just a synonym for "sacrifice," and in
  fact etymologically derives from the Roman custom of giving <i>flour</i>, not the burnt
  meat offerings I always assumed. But the <i>really</i> jarring thing, one that I don't
  know whether to lay at the feet of Ms. Oates or of Anathema Publishing is the
  <i>constant</i> misuse of the letter Eth (Ð,ð). This letter is used in modern
  Scandinavian tongues, and in the transcription of Old Norse and Old English, to
  represent the "voiced dental fricative" (the "th" sound in "that" rather than in
  "thing"). It appears that somewhere in the production of this book, whether in
  the original manuscript, the typesetting process, or something, Eth got used as
  a "fancy d." Now, this is not a <i>crazy</i> thing to do, as historically, Old Norse
  words with an Eth have been rendered in modern English with a "d" (most famous,
  and relevant example: Old Norse <i>Oðinn</i> to Modern English "Odin"). What sucks is
  that someone <i>over</i>-zealously flipped this rule around, such that words which
  really did have a "d" in Old Norse are instead printed with an "ð". Like <i>ðvergr</i>
  ("dwarf") or <i>ðraugr</i> ("restless dead"), or even <i>skalð</i> ("skald" - a Viking-age
  poet, like a bard). <i>All</i> of these should have "d" instead of "ð" - and it turns
  up in lots of other, less-familiar words, which makes it harder to know what
  it's supposed to be for someone like me who is passingly familiar with a lot of
  Old Norse words, but lacks the thorough grounding to just "know" where there
  should be a "d" and where an "ð". When I worked out this was happening, I almost
  threw the book across the room, because I had spent a good deal of it
  "relearning" how to pronounce some less familiar words. Oh, and one last
  complaint - there is no index! <i>Every</i> non-fiction book ought to have an index,
  but most of all works of a scholarly bent. Harumph. It was a real downer for
  such a <i>lovely</i> book to have screw ups like this.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orge97c6b6"></a>Is It Worth Reading?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge97c6b6">
  <p>
  As you may have gathered, I found this book a very mixed bag. It had some
  worthwhile insights and linked some dots I hadn't thought to put together and
  brought to my heed some works I'm looking forward to digging into more (like
  Zinner's translation and commentary on <i>Hrafnagaldr Odhins</i>). On the other hand,
  it had an overall viewpoint that I think got in the way of it being as helpful
  as it could be, the writing and editing were actively distracting, and I think
  some of the core assumptions and conclusions are mistaken. So, should <i>you</i> read
  it? I think if you are <i>deeply</i> interested in Odhinn, there's some worthwhile
  perspective and thoughts in here. If He is <i>not</i> an especial focus of yours, you
  might just give this one a pass.
  </p>

  <p>
  (To not do what I condemned Oates for doing, here's the full reference to
  Zinner's work: Zinner, Samuel. (2016). Oðinn's Ravens' Song - Translation and
  Commentary of Hrafnagaldur Oðins: An Old Norse Eddic Poem.

  </ul>

  <p>
  As I said before, <i>The Decline of the West</i> packs a <i>lot</i> into its two hefty volumes, much of it worth thinking about, reacting to, and linking to other works, but not all of which is as directly linked to the main ideas as what we've talked about so far in the series. So, I thought I'd go through the thoughts I wrote down while reading the book, the sayings I marked as well-said or thought-sparking, and any stray remarks from the earlier posts and start pulling out anything I wanted to share. So let's get to it!
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>Volume 1, Leaf 106 - Spengler makes the common claim that a fear of death is universal, and builds from there, but in <i>God is Read</i>, Vine Deloria, Jr. argues that Westerners may be projecting that onto other folks more than they know.</li>
  <li>V1, L. 107 - I found Spengler's contrast of "Space" versus "Time" as the foundations of perception and world-feeling especially interesting after having just read Tyson Yunkaporta's <i>Sand Talk</i> and Vine Deloria Jr.'s <i>God Is Red</i>. Both writers point out how strong a contrast there is between the folkways of their forebearers and those of Westerners, and both stress the importance of "place" to their forebearers, in a way that today's Westerners truly don't get</li>
  <li>V1, L. 160 - I've talked about Spengler's snobbery in past posts, and it's in full view here as he draws lines between "primitive man" and "great Cultures" in ways that I suspect are not wholly justified. That being said, I wonder what might come of rigorously applying his "Culture as organism" metaphor here - are the societies of "Primitive Men" a "different species" or merely an early phase of the same organism as "Great Cultures"? What might we learn by assuming each?</li>
  <li>V1, L. 216 - Shared symbols define cultures - fair enough. This becomes far more interesting when you apply the kind of understanding of symbols that occultists and Jungians have to the term - representations <i>fraught</i> with meaning, some of which is inherent, some of which is put on the thing by the observer, and some of which only comes out in their interaction. In other words, how much of a Culture is seeing some bit of the world for how it "truly is," how much is an accident of how that Culture looks at some things, and how much is from the folk of that Culture talking with each other, making art, and otherwise bouncing these symbols and their meanings off of each other?</li>
  <li>V1, L. 397 - Spengler thinks that "the Will" as its own distinct "thing," a bit of the soul you can point to unlike the rest of it, is a firmly Faustian thought, and that other Cultures plain don't see it as a standalone faculty</li>
  <li>V1, L. 448 - Spengler talks about "Ethical Socialism" as what he sees as the best-possible expression of Faustian Civilization (remember, a Civilization is the more materially-advanced, but spiritually frozen successor to the live Culture). Personally, I think this is one stead where he falls for the myth of Progress (mark the capital 'P') that he is mostly so good about calling out</li>
  <li>V1, L. 451 - I need to get around to reading <i>The Germanization of Christianity</i> by James C Russell (no relation, that I know of!), as Spengler talks about how Faustian Europe greatly changed the shape of the religion that the Romans brought north and west from the Levant.</li>
  <li>V1, L. 475 - A "near-religious" obsession with bodily health (diet, tee-totaling, exercise, and so forth) is evidence of turning religious instincts and sensibilities toward the material world, which is clearly a turning away from the spiritual world.</li>
  <li>V1, L. 478 - Spengler spells out in painful detail how the very Faustian thought of the "right to work," which started as a way of seeing everyone as worthy of dignity, but needing to prove they can earn it, turned into the Western equivalent of "Bread and Circuses" - the thing the powerful can distribute as patronage to get voters/foot soldiers on their side. And so, the very thing fought for so hard by generations of labor representatives, seamlessly mutates into the "duty to work," the engine that drives the rat race, consumerism, and so much more</li>
  <li>V1, L. 497 - The West seeks "conquest by measurement," which already struck me as weighty when I read it over a year ago, but jives rather well with John Michael Greer's post from a couple months back <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/the-reign-of-quantity/">The Reign of Quantity</a>.</li>
  <li>V1, L. 528 - He goes into how the religious "world-feeling" of dawning Cultures happened during their "epic" phase - the Homeric Age (~1100 - 800 BCE) for the Classical and the "Teutonic" Age for Faustian (~900 - 1200 CE). I think he is <i>too</i> dismissive of the earlier tales that were the raw inputs for the great works of myth written down in these times, but he makes a good point that the versions that have come down to us were worked up at particular times, conveying the worldview of particular folks, and it is likely foolish to see them as "pure" expressions of the older tales from which they draw the heroes, plots, and other bits.</li>
  <li>V1, L. 537 - The Classical culture saw divinity as local, embodied, and specific, whereas the Magian saw it as universal, immanent, and transcendental. If we allow that every Culture sees some bit of Being clearly that others miss, this gives us some good food for bethinking (meditation).</li>
  <li>V1, L. 542 - Classical "toleration" was merely the stretching out of what they already believed - unalike steads and unalike folks have unalike Gods, and it's right to worship the right God at the right stead, at the right time, with the right folk, and not to do so elsewhere/elsewhen. Spengler claims that the Western flavor of "toleration" is only a lack of religious sensibility, due to shifting into the worldlier Civilization phase of its lifecycle. He goes so far as to say that "Megalopolitan Man" (the typical resident of the major city/cities of Culture-turned-Civilization - think someone who lives in today's New York, London, or Berlin) <i>must</i> be lying to himself if he thinks he's religious. I think this is overly harsh, but in broad terms, there's some truth there.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 13 - Folks who like "thought" - abstract, mostly verbal, logical conceptions of things - tend to put far more weight on "thought" than it deserves. Taleb and others call out folks like this as "Intellectuals Yet Idiots" or, more commonly, "nerds".</li>
  <li>V2, L. 20 - Another bit that made me think about Yunkaporta and Deloria - here, Spengler contrasts the "thought-about life" with plain old "life".</li>
  <li>V2, L. 37 - Spengler is hella critical of Darwinism, which can't help but strike today's reader as hopelessly old-fashioned and ridiculous, but I found it a helpful reminder to take a hard look at those thoughts we take as given, and ask whether we believe them since they best fit or own experience of what the world is like and how it works, or since someone once told us that's how it is.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 68 - I've said before that I think Spengler is too harsh on the thought that one Culture can "influence" another, but her he gives a worked-out example of what he means, and it makes pretty good sense. He says that "Buddhism" did not cross over into China from India. Instead, when Indians started coming to China and talking about this "Buddhism" thing and what you had to do everyday if you took it seriously, some Chinese folks, of certain religious sensibilities, saw things that spoke to them in Buddhism and enthusiastically took up (a subset of) Buddhist practices and beliefs, and did with them what their religious sensibilities told them was best, resulting in a <i>very</i> different religion than original Indian "Buddhism." Spengler uses this as an example of how "influence" can be hard to pin down and maybe meaningless to claim, while there still might be lots of "influenced" folks.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 72 - Spengler claims that "Law" seems to have a lot of continuity from, say, the Romans through the civil codes of early modern continental reformers, and so on, but truly, the ideas of how to handle disputes, what deeds are okay and what not, and so forth, are wildly unalike, but using similar language and "justifications" to claim legitimacy.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 98 - Maybe Faustian culture invented archaeology, anthropology, archaeogenetics, and so forth <i>precisely</i> because the past is <i>far away</i>, which makes it exciting to the Faustian mind in a way it's not to folks from other cultures.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 123 - Spengler talks about the "rational planning" of megalopolitan cities, and it reminds me of the thought of "legibility" as originally talked about in <i>Seeing Like a State</i> by James C. Scott (still need to read this), and as slightly tweaked by Lou Keep in his posts on  <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk Machines</a>. The short version is that states and other centralizing tendencies want everything to be rationally understandable, but in rendering them so, sometimes (almost always) things that used to work get broken</li>
  <li>V2, L. 127 - A lot of takes have been put out about why "advanced societies" stop making babies, and most of them are economic or sociological, or what have you. Spengler puts forward a spiritual reason: once the question "why is life worth living, what's it all about?" is taken seriously enough by enough folks, then the thought that <i>Life</i> is a self-evident, bedrock principle is eroded. As Spengler says, the peasant whose family has farmed the same land for a thousand years doesn't have to ask "why should I go harvest the grain and teach my kids to do it?" That's just how it <i>is</i>. The man of the big city, though, has grown used to asking "what am I even doing here? does it mean anything?" and so the thought "how would a child cope with this?" is the natural next question, and the natural next answer is "he wouldn't!" and so, no kids.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 128 - Summing up the above: "When reasons have to be put forward at all in a question of life, life itself has become questionable."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 194 - Linguistics nerdery: day-to-day talk is for peasants and lords (holders of temporal power), philosophical, literary language is for priests (holders of spiritual power), and "koines" - simplified common tongues spoken with foreigners, is for merchants and the bourgeoisie</li>
  <li>V2, L. 203 - Here, Spengler maybe most confounds those who would consign him to some boring flavor of biological or linguistic determinist - he believes that a <i>people</i> (I assume this a translation of the German <i>folk</i>) is shaped by the deeds it does, and <i>not</i> the other way around. The Ostrogoths are known for what they were like <i>because</i> they conquered Spain, not the other way around. Americans are American because they sailed across a sea and came to a new continent. Sure, geographical, accidental, and other factors may shape what deeds a folk gets up to, but Spengler came down strongly on the side that what a folk <i>did</i> is what defined them.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 224 - Spengler links the Faustian interest in genealogy with Darwinism - rather dismissively, as you might have guessed</li>
  <li>V2, L. 232 - "<i>Lever doodt als Sklav</i> ('better dead than slave') is an old Frisian peasant-saying. The reverse has been the choice of every late Civilization, and every late Civilization has had to experience how much that choice cost it."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 242 - "A religion that has got as far as taking social problems in hand has ceased to be a religion."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 249 - Spengler thinks very local cults of religious practice were <i>only</i> a trait of the Classical Culture/Civilization, but I think this is nuts. <i>Every</i> culture used to worship in a highly local fashion, and many religions have ongoing practices that are super localized. Check out Shinto Shrines in Japan for one example.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 251 - "Carefully as Syncretism has been examined in recent years, the clue to its development - the transformation fo Eastern Churches into Western cults, and then the reverse process of transformation fo Western cults into Eastern Churches - has been missed."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 294 - An uncharacteristically pithy way of putting how Faustian, Classical, and Magian religious feelings are unalike: "Whereas the Faustian man is an 'I' that in the last resort draws its own conclusions about the Infinite; whereas the Apollonian man, as one <i>soma</i> among many, represents only himself; the Magian man, with his spiritual kind of being, is only a /part of a pneumatic 'We' that, descending from above, is one and the same in all believers."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 320 - "The Neoplatonist monk Sarapion went into the desert in order to devote himself entirely to studying the hymns of Orpheus." - Sounds like someone who might have some good insights into polytheistic devotional work. Poking around online, it looks like he might only be briefly mentioned in the works of Porphyry, and that his name is more commonly rendered in English these days as Serapion (with an 'e').</li>
  <li>V2, L. 351 - "This youthful inwardness proceeds always out of a townless countryside, out of villages, hovels, sanctuaries, solitary cloisters, and hermitages. Here is formed the community of high awareness, of the spiritual elect, which inwardly is separated by a whole world from the great being-currents of the heroic and the knightly." John Michael Greer, from whom I first learned about Spengler, speculates that today's American culture is not <i>truly</i> Faustian, but rather its own thing with a Faustian pseudomorphosis. He doesn't think a North American great Culture will arise for another few hundred years, but he thinks that there are hints of the world-feeling that will enliven it to be found if you look closely enough, as he talks about <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/america-and-russia-tamanous-and-sobornost/">here</a>. I wrote down this saying, as it might give a hint of where to look for more of these stirrings</li>
  <li>V2, L. 356 - "Out of these last surviving traces, however, an outline of the Early Classical religion emerges bright and distinct. Just as all Gothic inwardness directed itself upon Mary, Queen of Heaven and Virgin and Mother, so in tha tmoment of the Classical World there arose a garland of myths, images, and figures around Demeter, the bearing mother, around Gaia and Persephone, and also Dionysus the begetter, chthonian and phallic cults, festivals and mysteries of birth and death. All this, too, was characteristically Classical, conceived under the aspect of present corporeality. The Apollonian religion venerated body, the Orphic rejected it, that of Demeter celebrated the moments of fertilization and birth, in which body acquired being. There was a mysticisim that reverently honoured the secret of life, in doctrine, symbol, and mime, but side by side with it there was orgiasm too, for the squandering of the body is as deeply and closely akin to asceticism as sacred prostitution is to celibacy - both, all, are negations of time. It is the reverse of the Apollonian "halt!" that checks on teh threshold of Hubris; detachment is not kept, but flung away. He who has experienced these things in his soul has 'from being a mortal become a god.' In those days there must have been great saints and seers who towered as far above the figures of Heraclitus and Empedocles as the latter above the iternerant teachers of Cynicism and Stoicism - things of this order do not happen namelessly and impersonally. As the songs of Achilles and Odysseus were dying down everywhere, a grand, strict doctrine arose at the famous old cult-places, a mysticism and scholasticism with developed educational methods and a secret oral tradition, as in India. But all that is buried, and the relics of the later times barely suffice to prove that it once existed."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 380 - One of the core bits of the Faustian worldview is the symbol of "the Machine," which led both to literal, physical machines of great complexity and sophistication, but also, of course, the mechanical, dynamic worldview of scientific materialism</li>
  <li>V2, L. 413-414 - Here, Spengler talks about how the two sexes experience and understand the world in unalike ways. It struck me as a good supplement to Jungian views of the masculine and the feminine.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 422 - "There were no castes in the Old and Middle Kingdoms of Egypt, nor in India before Buddha, nor in China before Han times." At least in India, more recent genetic evidence suggests this might not be true, as the <i>Jatis</i> are <i>very</i> <a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2018/04/22/who-we-are-8-india/">genetically distinct</a>, suggesting thousands of years of pretty strict endogamy.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 423 - "In the Carolingian pre-Culture men distinguished <i>Knechte</i> [vassals], <i>Freie</i> [free men], and <i>Edle</i> [nobles]." Spengler brings in some other Germanic early middle ages examples and argues that these are the status distinctions of an early great Culture, which may or may not be true, but which reminded me of some other sources that suggest way older roots. Georges Dumezil was a French scholar of comparative mythology and religion who put forward the highly influential theory that Proto-Indo-European society was split up into three "functions" - the priests/judges, the warriors, and productive folks (farmers, craftsmen, maybe merchants, and so forth). Likewise, the Old Norse <i>Rigsthula</i>, tells how the God "Rig" (most folks read Him as Heimdall) originated the three levels of society: thralls (slaves), free men, and jarls (nobles) when he spent the night with a mortal couple that hosted him.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 427 - Spengler utterly contrasts the nobility with the priesthood, in terms of their experiences of life and how they come at the world-feeling or Soul Image of their culture. It led me to wonder how much of his view was shaped by how things are in Christianity, since in many Cultures, landholding warrior nobles also have important religious duties</li>
  <li>V2, L. 435 - "Honour" as <i>the</i> heart of the "custom-ethic" of the nobility, which called to mind <i>Honor: A History</i> by James Bowman, which has done a lot to shape my thinking over the years.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 440, Footmark 39 - "After death the teachers of error are excluded from the eternal bliss of the textbook and cast into the purgatorial fires of footnotes, whence, purged by the intercession of the believer, they ascend into the paradise of the paragraphs." Hah! Spengler does have a sense of humor, after all.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 442 - Spengler felt like those who gave their life to some craft, even if they came together in guilds, and even if those guilds became <i>tribes</i>, thanks to strict rules of heredity, never made up a <i>class</i> the way that nobles, priests, and peasants truly did, as their defining feature is and always was some tangible <i>skill</i>, and not some feeling for "the way the world is." I think Spengler's maybe overly harsh on craftsmen, and again, overly snobbish, but it's an interesting point to consider, especially when set next to things like <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924050079718">The Guild State</a> by George Robert Taylor.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 451 - "For it was a creative enthusiasm in the man of the city that from the tenth century B.C. (and 'contemporaneously' in other Cultures) drew generation after generation under the spell of a new life, with which there emerges for the first time in human history the idea of <i>freedom</i>. This idea is not of political (Still less of abstract) origin, but is something bringing to expression the fact that within the city walls plant-like attachment to a soil has ceased, and that the threads that run through the whole life of the countryside have been snapped. And consequently the freedom-idea ever contains a negative; it looses, redeems, defends, always frees a man <i>from</i> something. Of <i>this</i> freedom the city is the expression; the city-spirit is understanding become free, and everything in the way of in the way of intellectual, social, and national movements that bursts forth in Late periods under the name of Freedom leads back to an origin <i>in this one prime fact of detachment from the land</i>."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 453 - "As components of the Third Estate, which counts by heads and not by rank, they are all, in all Late periods of all Cultures 'liberal' in one way or another - namely, free from the inward powers of non-urban life. Economy is freed to make money, science freed to criticize. And so in all the great decisions we perceive the intellect with its books and its meetings having the word ('Democracy'), and money obtaining the advantages ('Plutocracy') - and it is never ideas, but always capital, that wins. But this again is just the opposition of truths and facts, in the form in which it develops from teh city-life. Moreover, by way of protest against the ancient symbols of the soil-bound life, the city opposes to the aristocracy of birth the notion of an aristocracy of money and an aristocracy of intellect - the one not very explicit as a claim, but all the more effective as a fact; the other a truth, but nothing more than that and, as a spectacle for the eye, not very convincing."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 463 - "To 'have the right' is an expression of power. This is a historical fact that every moment confirms, but it is not acknowledged in the realm of truth, which is not of this world. In their conceptions of right, therefore, as in other things, being and waking-being, Destiny and causality, stand implacably opposed. To the priestly and idealistic moral of good and evil belongs the <i>moral distinction of right and wrong</i>, but in the race-moral of good and bad the distinction is between those who give and those who receive the law. An abstract idea of justice pervades the minds and writings of all whose spirit is noble and strong and whose blood is weak, pervades all religions and all philosophies - but the fact-world of history knows only the <i>success</i> which turns the law of the stronger into the law of all." A somewhat rough way of thinking about things that I'm still wrestling with.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 469 - "But in the historical world there are no ideals, but only facts - no truths, but only facts. There is no reason, no honesty, no equity, no final aim, but only facts, and anyone who does not realize this should write books on politics - let him not try to <i>make</i> politics. In the real world there are no states built according to ideals, but only states that have <i>grown</i>, and these are nothing but living peoples 'in form.' No doubt it is 'the form impressed that living doth itself unfold,' but the impress has been that of the blood and beat of a <i>being</i>, wholly instinctive and involuntary; and as to the unfolding, if it is guided by the master of politics, it takes the direction inherent in teh blood; if by the idealist, that dictated by his own convictions - in other words, the way to nullity." I can't settle whether I think this is a helpfully clear-eyed splash of cold water on high-flying idealism, or hopelessly cynical nihilism.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 486, FM 51 - The "Blues" and the "Greens" of Byzantium, ostensibly fans of rival chariot racing teams, are often used as examples of utterly arbitrary, ridiculous tribalism/partisanship, but Spengler says that claiming they were "only" about the Circus teams is flat out wrong, instead, these were thinly-veiled parties of class interest, more like the Ghibellines and the Guelphs or the Optimates and Populares.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 487 - "And thus, at the close of the early periods of both these Cultures, we see two principles parallel and contrasted, the Faustian-genealogical and the Apollonian-oligarchic; two kinds of constitutional la, of Dike. The one is supported by an unmeasured sense of expanse, reaches back deep into the past with form-tradition, thinks forward with the same intense will-to-endure into the remotest future; but in the present, too, works for political effectiveness over broad expanses by well-considered dynastic marriages and by the truly Faustian, dynamic, and contrapuntal politics that we call <i>diplomacy</i>. The other, wholly corporeal and statuesque, is self-limited by its policy of <i>autarkeia</i> to the nearest and the most immediate present, and at every point stoutly denies that which Western being affirms." Conceptually, like Taleb, I'm a fan of City States as a model of government that seems to strike the right balance between collective will and power with limited scope and lots of variation, but Spengler thinks that the West is constitutionally unsuited to City States.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 491, FM 64 - Spengler points out that today's Western law is defined by <i>territory</i>, whereas Classical law was defined by <i>citizenship</i>. To put it another way, in Italy today, Italian law applies to everyone in the country, but 2,000 years ago, Roman law applied to every Roman, wherever he was in the world, and <i>not to anyone else in Italy</i> (at least the rights of the law, you could still be sued, of course)</li>
  <li>V2, L. 531 - Spengler believes that the West is uniquely suited to mass-printing, and therefore mass literacy, which sounds great, but also makes it uniquely suited to ideologies and other abstraction-based movements</li>
  <li>V2, L. 563 - Spengler dismisses philosophizing about politics as useless and hiding from us what we might learn by observing the actual facts of politics, and as usual, I think he has a point, but also as with many of his thoughts, I think he's a bit <i>too</i> sweeping in claiming there's <i>no</i> value in applying abstract thinking to politics.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 564 - Speaking of politics, here's a maybe useful way to think about it: "The being-streams of humanity are called History when we regard them as movement, and family, estate, people, nation, when we regard them as the object moved. Politics is the way in which this fluent Being maintains itself, <i>grows</i>, triumphs over other life-streams."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 567 - "The born statesman is above all a valuer - a valuer of men, situations, and things. He has the 'eye' which unhesitatingly and inflexibly embraces the round of possibilities. The judge of horses takes in an animal with one glance ad knows what prospects it will have in a race. To do the correct thing without 'knowing' it, to have the hands that imperceptibly tighten or ease the bit - his talent is the very opposite to that of the man of theory." For me, this calls to mind Clausewitz's discussion of the "commander's eye," which is the ability for a military commander to look at and instantly comprehend a situation and what needs to be done about it.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 570-571 - Spengler talks about how it's hard enough to do something great on your own, but it's <i>way</i> harder to build a tradition that consistently delivers men capable of great things - <i>that</i> is what a Culture is in its prime. The thing is, tradition, by its nature, eliminates the unique. So instead of a handful of truly great men, you get a large body or pretty good men. As Spengler put it "not a Caesar, but the Senate." This might be why you start seeing great men appear on the scene when these traditions <i>stop</i> so consistently producing fairly-high-excellence and become crappy. The wiggle room opened up is what naturally talented and ambitious men can use to do more than the tradition would have let them.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 577 - "But always it is the Non-Estate, the unit of protest against the essence of Estate, whose leading minority - 'educated' and 'well-to-do' - comes forward as a party with a program, consisting of aims that are not felt but defined, and of the rejection of everything that cannot be rationally grasped. <i>At bottom, therefore, there is only one party</i>, that of the bourgeoisie, the liberal, and it is perfectly conscious of its position as such. It looks on itself as coextensive with 'the people.' Its opponents (above all, the genuine Estates - namely, 'squire and parson') are enemies and traitors to 'the people,' and its opinions are the 'voice of the people' - which is inoculated by all the expedients of party-political nursing, oratory in the Forum, press in teh West, until these opinions do fairly represent it."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 580 - "An Estate has instincts, a party has a program, but a following has a master."</li>
  <li>V2, L. 593 - "Today we live so cowed under the bombardment of this intellectual artillery that hardly anyone can attain to the inward detachment that is required for a clear view of the monstrous drama. The will-to-power operating under a pure democratic disguise has finished off its masterpiece so well that the object's sense of freedom is actually flatered by the most thorough-going enslavement that has ever existed. The liberal bourgeois mind is <i>proud</i> of the abolition of censorship, the last restraint, while the dictator of the press - Northcliffe! - keeps the slave-gang of his readers under the whip of his leading articles, telegrams, and pictures. <i>Democracy has by its newspaper completely expelled the book from the mental life of the people</i>. The book-world, with its profusion of standpoints that compelled thought to select and criticize, is now a real possession only for a few. The people reads the <i>one</i> paper, 'its' paper, which forces itself through the front doors by millions daily, spellbinds the intellect from morning to night, drives the book into oblivion by its more engaging layout, and if one or another specimen of a book does emerge into visibility, forestalls and eliminates its possible effects by 'reviewing' it." Am I a part of this process by writing these posts? Hmmm. Also, just imagine how he'd feel about social media!</li>
  <li>V2, L. 594-595 - Just as widespread literacy makes folks more susceptible to abstraction-based ideologies and politics, once folks get used to getting their political thoughts from media, it's not a big jump for a single person to start sharing what he wants folks to do through that media, meaning that widespread literacy/access to information actually makes it <i>easier</i> for a caesar to arise. Ouch.</li>
  <li>V2, L. 599 - Spengler sees the industrial economy for the historical aberration it is, which is hard enough to do today, but must have been nearly impossible in his time, when it was still on the ascendant</li>
  <li>V2, L. 605 - Once again, Spengler contrasts the fields of Fact (like economics and politics) and the fields of Truth (like religion and philosophy) and how they are ultimately irreconcilable. Once again, I think he has good insight, but is overly strong. It also came to me that polytheism might help with some of these contradictions - not every "higher truth" has to be a <i>universal</i> higher truth - maybe some things really are transcendent realities of one kind or another, but their applicability is only to a given place, time, or folk?</li>
  <li>V2, L. 607 - Spengler points out how in early Cultures, trade and war are intrinsically linked - they're both about getting stuff to bring back home, it's only the tactics that differ. This meshes with what we know about how Vikings worked - if it seemed easier/less risky/more profitable to trade, they'd trade, but if it seemed like they could just take what they wanted, they'd do that. This gave me a bit of insight into why the Romans might have identified Woden as "Mercury" - for the Germanish folks wandering into the Empire, trade and war were likely still obviously linked, and so when the Romans talked about a God of trade and exchange, they must have been like "oh yeah, we've got a God for that too"</li>
  <li>V2, L. 622 - Spengler talks about how different Cultures have different flavors of "money thinking" - they literally see money in different ways and therefore seek and use it differently. I wonder if anyone else has picked up on this, as it might be rather interesting. At least to me, since I have a bit of a thing for the history and nature of money. So far, my favorite work on its history is <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out</a> by Nick Szabo, but that is pretty much the opposite to what Spengler is talking about, since he argues for the universal qualities of what makes money "money."</li>

  <p>
  Looking over my notes for these two fat tomes, I think we are coming close to
  the end of my posts on <i>Decline of the West</i>. I'm thinking after this post, I'll
  do one more with a "grab bag" of thoughts, sayings, and other bits that jumped
  out at me and seem worth sharing, but that aren't drawn together by a lone
  thread the way posts up until this one have been. Of course, if you're hopping
  up and down yelling about something weighty I missed, by all means let me know,
  and who's to say we won't come back to Spengler sometime down the road? As I
  said, there's <i>a lot</i> in those books.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org9461f9b"></a>Ages of Reason - "We Will Understand Everything!"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9461f9b">
  <p>
  As every Culture goes about its development, it finds that its own world-feeling
  brings it insights into how the world works that no other Culture has had. Drawn
  on by the intoxicating aroma of intellectual breakthroughs, it starts to see the
  patterns in the insights of its thinkers and as a group, they work out an
  overall framework for understanding the world based on these patterns. Early on,
  such work has great drive and high hopes - "we'll understand the world and how
  it works down to the deepest groundings!" Here in those Cultures shaped by the
  Faustian, we are most familiar with one flavor of this: "the Enlightenment."
  When the Royal Society and friends got going, they had very high hopes that
  hidden underpinnings of the world would be made clear, and that we would come to
  <i>finally</i> understand the world the way it "really" is. Many folks still hold out
  hope that the scientific method will bring this about, but the, erm,
  embarrassing fact that major physics breakthroughs stopped happening nearly a
  hundred years ago is making itself harder and harder to ignore.
  </p>

  <p>
  The thing is, looking backward and farther afield, we can see that ours is not
  the first Culture to find an intellectual tool of great might, wield it against
  every conceivable problem, and become convinced that it is the end-all, be-all
  of intellectual investigation. The Apollonian Culture worked out formal reason
  and thought that everything worth knowing could be worked out with it. The
  Magian Culture came up with Algebra and linked ways of turning hard problems
  into numbers, as well as the thought of "variables" - numbers whose value you
  didn't know, but about which you could make reasonable statements. The Chinese
  Culture, focused as it always has been on how folks get along in the world,
  turned its Age of Reason on human interactions and politics, coming up with some
  of the most systematic understandings of human behavior ever written down. As I
  said above, the crowning achievement of Faustian Reason is, of course, the
  Scientific Method, and its bleeding edge is those fields of science that require
  analytical mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>
  Now, this is one of the stronger arguments I have for why Spengler is wrong in
  his contention that <i>nothing</i> truly gets carried over from one culture to
  another - modern computing would never have happened without an attempt to put
  together formal logic with algebraic variables in an effort to more readily
  solve analytic math problems (check out Babbage's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a> sometime).
  If you've learned that "if p, then q does not necessarily imply if not p, then
  not q," then you are an heir to the height of the Classical age of reason. Hell,
  if you've learned that a triangle's angles must add up to 180 degrees, then you
  are too. Likewise with algebra and Magian civilization. I think it very likely
  that the great Cultures of the years to come will make use of the scientific
  method and calculus, without the Faustian assumption that these ways and these
  alone will throw open the veils of nature's mysteries.
  </p>

  <p>
  As I said above, all of these systems are <i>very good</i> at unriddling the hidden
  truths of the world. Unluckily, none of them can unriddle <i>every</i> hidden truth of
  the world. Each Culture has its own unique way of seeing the world, and uses
  that to see things that no other Culture has yet. But just as that point of view
  brings insight, it also brings blind spots. Systems of Reason are systems of
  <i>abstraction</i>, and no abstraction can handle every nuance. In fact, as these
  systems of abstraction build, they tend to turn inward upon themselves -
  abstractions about abstractions and so on, ad nauseam. It turns out the world is
  a big, weird place, and the little lumps of wet electric meat we use to make
  sense of it can only go so far. Which means that after a long enough time of
  using this shiny new hammer to treat every mystery as a nail, Cultures start to
  work out that their given way of understanding the world rationally doesn't
  deliver on its promise to replace the certainty once given by religious thought
  and feeling. Systems of reason tear apart the old sources of meaning with the
  promise that they will find greater meaning on the other side of the carnage,
  but then never deliver on that promise. And so, as Cultures transition into
  Civilizations, they find themselves needing to get back in touch with meaning.
  Which brings us to the "Second Religiousness."
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org54d8b0f"></a>The Second Religiousness - "Actually, We Need Meaning Again"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org54d8b0f">
  <p>
  Spengler argues that as a Culture turns into a Civilization, one of the many
  threads of exhaustion and ennui that adds to the loss of Cultural vigor is that
  the Age of Reason fails to live up to its early high hopes. It turns out that
  you <i>can't</i> work everything out logically if you're just careful enough about
  premises. Nor can variables capture <i>all</i> of the complexity of our messy world.
  And, these days, it seems that not even the scientific method can unravel every
  last mystery - physics has stalled out since at least the 70s, and attempts at
  grand, unifying theories have been found&#x2026; wanting. Unluckily, along the way,
  systems of Reason tend to wholly dismantle the faith that gave meaning before
  their rise. And so, when the methods of Reason start to falter, the folk of that
  Civilization find themselves face-to-face with the big, scary world, and every
  way of making it have meaning has been found wanting in one way or another. And
  so, the folks of the Civilization turn their hearts and minds back toward what
  once brought meaning - the spiritual yearnings of the original "World-Feeling"
  that underlies their Culture's "Soul Image" that we already <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_3_the_soul_image">talked about</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Coming back to this sense of "what the world is like" that was there at the dawn
  of the Culture, but now in a powerful Civilization that has interacted with, or
  even subjugated, very unalike cultures, this "Second Religiousness" tends to be
  syncretic in nature. It pieces together the images, stories, and symbolism of
  widely varied Cultures into a way of describing the Civilization's most deeply
  felt sense of the world. In other words, to use a recent pop culture reference,
  you get a "reboot" of the same original spiritual conception, but using the
  symbolic, philosophical, and literary furniture of a more cosmopolitan age. The
  mashup of Taoism, Buddhism, Animism, and Ancestor Worship that became "Chinese
  Traditional Religion," the blend of Greek philosophy, Egyptian Magic, and Middle
  Eastern rites that was late Classical paganism, and so forth. It's impossible to
  predict <i>exactly</i> what shape the Second Religiousness will take ahead of time, but
  you can guess at some of what it will be like. The first stirrings of this trend
  come when the Civilization is still feeling its worldly strength (such as the
  Augustan age in Rome), but when hindsight will show it has passed its peak.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some say that here in the West, we're starting to see the first signs of the
  Second Religiousness with things like Tradcaths and the growing interest in
  Orthodox Christianity. It's hard to say, since these things are best identified
  with hindsight, but whatever shape it takes, it will likely be something that
  speaks to whatever Gothic Catholicism did, but in a new way, bringing in
  elements from around the world. Maybe it will be a Buddhism with communion and
  yoga, or Christianity with Orisha and Stoic Ethics. Again, we can't say ahead of
  time, but it's very likely that as science keeps on showing itself inadequate to
  answer the deepest questions of meaning, we will see more and more folks turn
  (back) to religion, whatever shape it takes. Given my own interests, I'm very
  curious to see what happens in my lifetime.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71eb6a5">
  <p>
  As I said at the top, right now, I'm thinking one more post on some of the
  grabby thoughts from the books that didn't <i>quite</i> have enough meat on the bone
  for whole posts, but there's always more to dig into here, most of all if/when I
  get to reading some other Cyclical History thinkers, like Vico or Toynbee. For
  now, though, I hope these posts have helped you understand Spengler, or at least
  to know what folks are on about when they bring him up. If not, do let me know,
  and I'll do what I can to make them better.

  </ul>

  <p>
  We've now gone over what I believe to be the weightiest things to take away from
  <i>Decline of the West</i>: looking at history and cultures <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">morphologically</a>, thinking
  about cultures as if they are <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">living thing</a>, and the thought that each culture is
  defined by its <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_3_the_soul_image">"Soul Image"</a>. I thought about wrapping up this series there, but
  these two weighty tomes have a <i>lot</i> of stuff to them, and I think there's a few
  more things worth getting from the books. I'm working these posts out as I go,
  so I'm not sure how many more we'll have, but for today, at least, we've got
  more Spengler to dive into. This time we're going to talk about two key
  distinctions he makes throughout the book and the general idea that underlies
  both of them: time versus destiny, and space versus motion. With these, Spengler
  gets darn near <i>metaphysical</i>, so let's dig in.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org408d41a"></a>Time and Destiny - What Happened against What to Do<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org408d41a">
  <p>
  Spengler talks often about the difference between "time" and "destiny." This is
  one of those steads where he speaks very emphatically and kind of assumes you
  know what he means, but he mostly just gestures at examples of the distinction
  and says "see? This what I'm talking about." The best way I can think to put it
  is that time is what you perceive when you look back over events and make sense
  of what happened when, whereas destiny is the feeling of being in the moment or
  looking ahead and being aware that things change. Time is the purview of the
  historian, the dry content of stories of what came before. Destiny is the
  purview of the man of action - it's the feeling that things will not last, that
  you can change their course, and the world might be some other way than what it
  is now. Spengler talks about how folks of different classes tend to feel more of
  one or more of the other, but also how during different phases of a Culture's
  lifecycle, one way or the other tends to be more widespread. Time is farthest
  from Destiny when it is treated as a measurable quantity, merely one more kind
  of distance.
  </p>

  <p>
  In fact, Spengler argues that the very idea of "cause and effect" is an artifact
  of a rationalizing/systematizing way of looking at Time. You can only clearly
  identify cause and effect <i>after</i> the event, as you think about what happened as a
  sequence of episodes, rather than the fluid, organic flow of one thing happening
  into another. Now, obviously, Spengler doesn't mean that you can't take an
  action because you know or suspect what outcome it will bring, but this is from
  past experience. To the degree that it's automatic (you move your hand to where
  the ball will be to catch it), you're not really thinking in terms of cause and
  effect - you have a goal and you do what you need to do to get it. You don't
  have to understand the ballistics of the ball mathematically to do that. On the
  other hand, if you <i>are</i> reasoning about cause and effect consciously, in advance,
  you're really doing two things, both of which are backward-looking. First, you
  are drawing on facts about the world that you know, whether from experience,
  book learning, or whatever, and comparing them to this situation. Secondly, you
  are imagining the end state and then asking "what would it take for me to be
  there instead of here?" So you are looking backward in your imagination.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's get <i>real</i> weird and mix our Spengler with a little pop culture. This
  example is <i>perfect</i>, but you may or may not know it. In the surprisingly-great
  cartoon show <i>Gravity Falls</i>, one of the main characters, a 12 year old boy named
  Dipper, has an enormous crush on a cool older girl, Wendy. There's a party at
  the funky tourist trap they both work at (Dipper's uncle runs the place is why
  he's working as a 12 year old). Dipper, being the nerdy reasoning type comes up
  with a plan with literal numbered steps about how he will talk to Wendy and get
  her to like him. The show being what it is, this leads to hilarious paranormal
  hijinks, and of course this ridiculous plan doesn't work, but in the midst of
  it, Dipper runs into Wendy while they're both waiting to go to the bathroom, and
  they just talk, and it goes great. When Dipper tried to plan every step, to know
  what would happen in what sequence and how long it would take, he was dealing
  with <i>Time</i>. When he just got out of his own way and acted like a normal human
  with the flesh and blood girl in front of him, he was dealing with <i>Destiny</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  So, to bring it back to Spengler, he believed that early in a Culture's
  lifecycle, it is more caught up with Destiny, and less worried about Time.
  Later, during the Civilization phases, Time comes to dominate. I should likely
  stress that Spengler doesn't say that either is <i>better</i>, though you always kind
  of get the impression he finds Destiny more appealing and mourns living in an
  age where no one can avoid thinking more about Time than Destiny. He also felt
  that men concerned with Life (the capital L is in the text), with shaping the
  world to their will, tend to feel Destiny more keenly, whereas eggheads, bean
  counters, and scribblers (thinkers, merchants, and writers) tend to see the
  world through the lens of Time.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org5495d1d"></a>Space and Motion - Where to Move Through against What Even Is "Moving"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5495d1d">
  <p>
  Okay, I've got to come clean here - this one has been tough for me to get my
  head around, and I'm not wholly sure I'm there yet. Spengler believed that a
  Culture's <i>Depth-Feeling</i>, the way it experienced the physical space around it,
  and the fact that some things are closer and some things are farther, was one of
  the main drivers of their <i>World-Feeling</i>, which is expressed by the <i>Soul-Image</i> we
  talked about last time. He says that the Faustian obsession with far-off point
  on the horizon, always visible, always receding, comes from the experience of
  both mighty, towering trees in the forests of northern and western Europe, and
  also from the plains of central Europe. The obsession with what is <i>right here</i>
  that I can <i>touch</i> held by the Apollonian culture was born of tiny islands and a
  craggy peninsula, where your entire life might be lived in a physical space that
  you can see all of from most vantage points. The Magian "great dome" is rooted
  in the experience of the roof of stars in piercing brilliance stretched over the
  clear, desert night.
  </p>

  <p>
  In other words, Spengler believed that different Cultures <i>feel</i> "space" very
  differently, and that the way folks in the modern West think of "space" is very
  much shaped by the Faustian Depth- and World-Feelings, and our understanding of
  "motion" even more so (more on that in a moment). The way that we think of
  "space" as a fixed, abstract dimension, as if we are moving around in a
  three-axis Cartesian plot with coordinates around an origin, is <i>deeply</i> rooted in
  how Faustian culture experiences the world around it. Scholars of the Apollonian
  Culture would likely have found such thoughts strange. Artistically, Western
  culture is the <i>only one ever</i> to come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">linear vanishing-point perspective</a>,
  because to Renaissance artists (firmly Faustian in Spengler's mind, fooling
  themselves about how "Classical" they were), that was just "how the world
  looked", but to artists from other cultures is just <i>did not</i> look that way, or to
  whatever degree it did, that was not what was <i>important</i> to represent
  two-dimensionally.
  </p>

  <p>
  Now, if Motion is understood as objects changing location in Space, then you can
  see that how a Culture sees Space can't help but shape its understanding of
  Motion. Newton's expression of Motion as forces acting upon mass in space
  obviously has a lot to recommend it - look at what the West has done with this
  model! But it turns out that "force" is kind of a weird, tricky idea to actually
  pin down, and a bunch of physicists since have tried to find ways of
  understanding motion that don't require it. Spengler says that Newton was
  expressing some pretty fundamental ideas about what the world is and how it
  works that were deeply rooted in the Faustian psyche. I'm not gonna lie to you,
  Marge: I don't wholly get what Spengler means here, so let's let the man speak
  for himself:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Newton, a deeply religious nature, was only bringing the Faustian world-feeling
  to expression when, to elucidate the words "force" and "motion," he said that
  masses are points of attack for force and carriers for motion. So the
  thirteenth-century Mystics had conceived of God and his relation to world.
  Newton no doubt rejected the metaphysical element in his famous saying
  "<i>hypotheses non fingo</i> [I contrive no hypotheses]," but all the same he was
  metaphysical through and through in the founding of his mechanics. <i>Force is the
  mechanical Natures-picture of Western man; what Will is to his soul-picture and
  infinite Godhead in his world-picture</i>. The primary ideas of this physics stood
  firm long before the first physicist was born, for they lay in the earliest
  religious world-consciousness of our Culture.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Spengler, O. (2020). <i>Decline of the West, Volume I: Form and Actuality</i>. Arktos.
  Page 517. Emphasis in the original.
  </p>

  <p>
  Right now, my main takeaway is that when you are living in Destiny, rather than
  time, you don't really give much heed to "motion" as a <i>thing</i> - you just notice
  what the moving things around you are doing and what it means to you (grab this,
  dodge that, dance with her, run from him, and so forth). When you stop and try
  to work out what's "really" happening there, you have to have some sense of
  Space as a thing that can be measured, and Time as a thing that can be measured,
  and those are both deeply rooted in your Culture's worldview, so the science
  your culture invents will be shaped by those, likely at a way-down-deep level
  where you don't even notice it. In the same chapter that the above quote is
  from, Spengler argues that a Culture's "Nature-knowing" (what we call science
  these days) thinks that it is an objective study of what's "out there," but that
  it might be better understood as an extremely sophisticated way for a culture to
  come to understand itself.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf92c8d9"></a>Closing - What to Do With These Thoughts?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf92c8d9">
  <p>
  As you can see, these thoughts are maybe less <i>directly</i> helpful in making sense
  of the world than the big ones we've touched on in earlier posts. That being
  said, if you <i>are</i> intrigued by Spengler's way of looking at the world and you'd
  like to apply some of his tools, these are where we start to get specific enough
  to start doing some original analysis. Say you want a "Spenglerian" take on a
  Culture he doesn't get much into, like the pre-Columbian Mesoamericans, or
  China, or India. Here's where to start - what kind of Destiny called its men of
  action to do their great deeds? How did its natural philosophers come to think
  about Time? What Depth-Feeling shaped their sense of Space? How did they
  conceive of objects moving through that Space?
  </p>

  <p>
  The other big thing that is helpful about these thoughts is that they make <i>very</i>
  clear that the things we take for granted, stuff that we assume are "objective
  facts about the universe" are, instead, models. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22">"The Map is Not the Territory."</a>
  <i>Every</i> understanding of the world involves some amount of abstraction - taking
  heed of some things about the world and leaving others out. The world is too big
  and weird for us to do otherwise. Spengler gives a wealth of examples to really
  disabuse you of the likely lingering feeling that "yeah, okay, I know, they're
  all models, but this one is <i>basically</i> how it really is, right?"
  </p>

  <p>
  As I said many times above, I'm not wholly happy with my understanding of these
  thoughts, so we may come back to them, and I'd welcome any thoughts, add-ons, or
  fixes.

  Okay, so last time I put forth that Spengler's thought that Cultures are best
  looked at as living beings that have a common lifecycle that can be found out by
  looking at many cultures morphologically was the single biggest and most helpful
  thought in these big, fat books. Today, I want to talk about what comes in a
  very close second - the "Soul Image" (though Spengler talks about the same thing
  in a few ways throughout the books, this is the term in the Table of Contents,
  and so I'm treating it as the "most official." No idea what words he uses in
  German for the same thought). If the thought behind <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">Culture as Organism</a> is to
  look at the ways in which Cultures across time and space are <i>alike</i>, the Soul
  Image is meant to tell us the ways that they are <i>unalike</i>. This might be
  Spengler's <i>most</i> touchy-feely, qualitative, hard-to-prove, easy-to-argue concept
  in his whole mighty tome, but it is also the beating heart of said tome. You
  either run into this idea and go "oh wow, yeah, that is so right!" or else you
  recoil from it as unprovable, judgmental hogwash. Sounds fun, right? Let's jump
  in.
  </p>

  <p>
  Spengler believed that what made a Great Culture a Great Culture was that the
  folks who made it up had some deeply felt sense about what the world is like and
  what someone alive in it ought to do about that. He further believed that this
  sense was shaped by the lands that gave rise to these Cultures - an Egyptian
  tending his fields after the yearly flood of the Nile has enriched them is going
  to understand the world and its workings rather unlike the way that a German
  peasant who had to cut his field out of a deep, dark, and gnarly wood is going
  to, and neither of them will much see the world like a Mongolian herder rounding
  up his sheep on the vast steppe. The land, the turnings of the year, the
  weather, the plants and beasts that make up the background to life will all lead
  to folks thinking about the world and what it's like in ways that don't look
  much like each other. How do we know? Well, take a look at the art they make,
  the buildings they build, the music they make, and so forth. In other words,
  look at their <i>culture</i>, in the sense that the word meant before the
  anthropologists got a hold of it and gave it a broader and more universal
  meaning. Spengler had no truck with that - to him, "primitive" people didn't
  have "culture" - that was reserved for the folks who went out and did <i>great</i>
  things and made <i>art</i>. I never said the guy wasn't a snob, but he was at least a
  very well-trained snob.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, this is all rather abstract, so let's try to look at some of the Soul
  Images Spengler talks about. For the Classical or Apollonian Culture (Greeks and
  Romans), the Soul Image was the perfect human body, right <i>here</i>, defined
  tangible, in a particular place. For the Middle Eastern or Magian (from ~200-100
  BCE or so), it is sitting within a great dome, whether a cave, the roof of a
  tent, or the night sky in the desert, placed there by an all-powerful and
  personally involved creator. For the Western or Faustian Culture (European from
  ~500 CE), the Soul Image is the idea of chasing an ever-receding point in
  infinite space - the distant goal on the horizon or the point where all the
  trees in the forest seem to come together in the sky. Spengler speaks a bit
  about the Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, and Mesoamerican Soul Images, but he knew
  these Cultures and their histories less well and they had less direct bearing on
  his Europe and where it might be going. His thought is that each of these Soul
  Images is the deeply felt sense of something deep and weighty, something that
  stirs the soul, but that is ever so hard to truly say or show someone - that's
  why it takes a Culture over a thousand years to wear out the artistic,
  architectural, and philosophical possibilities of that Soul Image and settle
  into rehashing what has come before during the Civilization bit of the
  lifecycle.
  </p>

  <p>
  Spengler believed that someone from a given Culture could not help but see the
  world through its Soul Image, and on the flip side, could not <i>truly</i> understand
  how folks from another Culture saw the world or what their Soul Image was all
  about. Oh sure, you could come to understand it intellectually, but it would
  never be deeply <i>felt</i> as "just how things are" the way it would be for a native
  of the culture. A crude analogy from my own experience: if you are a Millenial
  or a Gen Xer, chances are pretty good that you marked the coming of Anime to the
  United States. In the 80s, a handful of deeply weird and often very bloody films
  found their way into odd pockets of US popular culture, and a few more shows
  were carefully localized and cleaned up for American audiences and presented
  without their Japaneseness being highlighted (like <i>Robotech</i>). In the 90s, this
  picked up a bit, and you started finding American folks who were into "Anime" as
  a genre/subculture/fandom/whatever - my cool older friend showed me a fan sub of
  <i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i> that his college Anime Club had put together
  when he was home for the summer. By the early 2000's, the makers of mainstream
  American animation had recognized a hot fad and wanted to get in on the action.
  The result was a stream of American-made cartoons that sloppily and awkwardly
  aped not only the visual style of Anime (which was itself a Japanese
  re-interpretation of Disney animation, originally), but also attempted to bring
  in bits of Japanese culture or tropes (like the giant sweat drop in frame to
  show a character's embarrassment, or a guy getting a nosebleed because he's so
  turned on by a girl). The worst were the attempts to copy Japanese humor. The
  Americans making this stuff <i>kinda-sorta</i> understood what anime was doing, and
  they recognized something appealing, but they did not <i>grok it in fullness</i>, and
  the results were often cringeworthy. By the 2010s, most folks involved in and
  interested in animation had worked out ways to take the stuff from anime that
  was most amenable to American culture and more smoothly incorporate it, and you
  didn't get as much stuff faking being Japanese.
  </p>

  <p>
  Maybe this example doesn't resonate with you, but I'm sure that you can think of
  examples of (popular) culture where folks from one Culture have tried to imitate
  an artform, trope, style, or way of being from another Culture, and the results
  have been hilariously <i>off</i>. Spengler called such attempts to adopt the Soul Image
  of another Culture <i>pseudomorphosis</i>. The term comes from geology. Imagine a
  formation of limestone surrounded by another, harder rock. Over time, the
  limestone is eroded away by water, leaving a limestone-shaped and textured
  hollow. Then, some magma flows into this space and fills it like metal cast into
  a mold. You now have a formation that has the outward appearance of limestone,
  but the composition of an igneous rock. This is an igneous rock that has
  undergone a <i>pseudomorphosis</i>, which is Greek for "false shaping." Spengler makes
  <i>much</i> use of this metaphor in understanding history and to explain why the
  Cultures he sees, and the lifecycle he propounds for them, have not been more
  obvious to others. Spengler saw pseudomorphosis when a Culture (usually younger
  and with less worldly power) runs into another Culture and for one reason or
  another tries to adopt artistic, architectural, or intellectual styles from the
  other Culture, but in the process, can't help but apply its own Soul Image.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of Spengler's more provocative assertions is that the usual understanding of
  "Western Culture" is mistaken, and is, in fact, a series of successive Cultures
  given a false sense of continuity through pseudomorphoses. You had the
  Classical/Apollonian Culture, which hardened into a Civilization by the
  Hellenistic era, meaning that most of what we remember about Rome was also in
  the Civilization phase, then as that Civilization was crumbling, the young,
  vigorous Middle Eastern/Magian Culture took on a Classical pseudomorphosis,
  giving us "Late Antiquity," the early Christian Church, and the Byzantine
  Empire. And lastly, the Magian-wearing-Classical-Clothes church then provided a
  pseudomorphosis for the aborning Western/Faustian culture in the late Dark
  Ages/Early Medieval period, with a more conscious and direct Classical
  pseudomorphosis in the Renaissance. In other words, the great continuity of the
  "Western Canon" taught in universities until rather recently, from Homer through
  Faulkner, was seen by Spengler as glossing over real and important transitions
  and changes in worldview.
  </p>

  <p>
  As I said near the top of this post, Spengler's argument rests on a lot of
  subjective, qualitative judgment, which many folks immediately take as
  "therefore not valid." But heimjunge built those subjective, qualitative
  judgments on a <i>lot</i> of knowledge of the Culture(s) at hand, and so it's worth at
  least taking the assertion seriously as a point to consider. One example of what
  I mean that's relevant to some of the other interests I blog about: the
  "Neoplatonists" like Plotinus and Iamblichus were philosophers/religious figures
  of the 3rd Century CE. Most historians see these as straightforwardly
  late-Classical members of the Hellenistic world, heirs to the clearly Classical
  Plato that their name implies. Not so Señor Spengler. He says that if you
  actually read what Neoplatonists believed, it seems to have a lot more in common
  with the mostly-monotheistic beliefs of the Middle Eastern/Magian world, and
  shares their concern with spelled-out ethical systems, rather than the Classical
  focus on the individual and his excellence. In other words, Spengler argues that
  the Neoplatonists are <i>truly</i> Magian, but undergoing a Classical pseudomorphosis.
  Likewise, most folks see the Christian Church as an element of continuity
  between the late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. Spengler instead points out
  how <i>very</i> unalike the faith of the Desert Fathers with its asceticism and strict
  monotheism was from medieval Catholicism with its panoply of saints and great
  focus on Mary - again, he sees European Catholicism as a Faustian religious
  expression under a Magian pseudomorphosis.
  </p>

  <p>
  I find the idea of pseudomorphosis, along with the foundational idea that
  different cultures <i>really are</i> deeply different, a helpful one, but I don't take
  it quite as far as Spengler did. Splengler thought that folks from different
  cultures could never <i>truly</i> understand the world in the same way, and that when
  one Culture took something from another, it was only ever a shallow imitation.
  To his mind, the Hagia Sophia was <i>truly</i> Magian and the fact that it borrowed
  Classical architecture was a diminishment or misdirection of that underlying
  Soul Image. Likewise the cathedrals of Europe - to the degree that they used
  Classical or Magian models, they were obfuscating the Faustian spirit trying to
  express itself through them. To some degree, I'm sure that Spengler was
  overreacting to the default position of absolute continuity from (at least)
  Greece through to the modern West that was popular in his day. He also might
  have been overstating his case either for rhetorical effect, or from the usual
  attachment we form with our best-loved ideas. Whatever the case, I think
  Spengler took too hard of a line.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think the true picture is more complicated (and more interesting). For one
  thing, there are some elements of <i>deep</i> cultural continuity that we know about -
  for example, did you know that some fairy tales go back to at least the ice age?
  Or how about the fact that until very recently, anywhere from Ireland to India,
  it was assumed that a woman would take her husband's name when they got
  married - that has its roots in proto-Indo-European cultural practice. So, for
  Spengler to argue that <i>everything</i> the West got from the Apollonian or Magian
  cultures was "false" in some sense strikes me as far fetched. The Neoplatonism
  mentioned above comes to mind - though surely we understand it differently today
  than did Plotinus, and he was likely farther from Plato than he might have
  thought, there's a common thread of understanding the world uniting nearly 2500
  years of thinkers, and that's pretty cool.

  <li><a id="org2d057db"></a>Lead-In: The Grounding for Spengler's Whole Work is "Culture as Living Thing with a Lifecycle"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2d057db">
  <p>
  <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">Last time</a>, we talked about Spengler's use of <i>morphology</i> to understand history and identify parallels between different Cultures at different times. Today, I'd like to talk about why he chose a biological metaphor and what he got from it. Maybe <i>the</i> key takeaway from <i>The Decline of the West</i> is the thought that Great Cultures/Civilizations are best thought of as <i>living things</i> that are born, grow up, show certain hallmarks, and after some time, grow old and die - just like you, me, and every other man, beast, and plant on earth. I don't know whether Spengler had the insight that Cultures are like living things and so pulled out the morphology, or if his use of the morphological way of understanding things led him to the thought that Cultures are best seen as living things. Either way, the two thoughts are very closely linked, and so I had some trouble working out which to speak to first, or even whether they ought to be two posts of their own, or put together into one. As you can clearly see, I went with two posts of their own, with "morphology" coming first, and now onto the lifecycle of Cultures. I thought that the lifecycle would be easier to talk about if we had the shared understanding of morphology that the last post hopefully brought about, and so now here we are.

  <li><a id="orgea3c35e"></a>"Culture" against "Civilization" - Phases in the Lifecycle<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgea3c35e">
  <p>
  First off, a bit of terminology that might be confusing if you have bumped into Spengler's thoughts, but not read his book. He talks about Cultures and Civilizations (the capital letters are used to make it clear we're talking about a specific concept here). I have heard that the German words <i>Kultur</i> and <i>Zivilisation</i> might have connotations closer to what Spengler meant in his work, but I don't speak German, and so I can't quite say. Instead, let me explain what I understand from the translation. When Spengler speaks of a "Culture," he does not mean just some group of folks with a shared way of being in the world, the way your Cultural Anthropology professor might. Instead, he means a group of folks with a <i>very particular</i> insight into the world (a "World Image," which we'll talk about more next time), that are in the midst of doing great things to explore that insight and try to make it manifest through art, writing, politics, and ways of living - everything that a modern English speaker would call (note the little 'c') "culture." A "Civilization," on the other hand, is what a Culture <i>turns into</i> when it has exhausted itself in exploring its particular way of looking at the world and instead just uses that way of looking at the world to get material things done, like conquering other folks who don't have their stuff quite as together. In Spengler's way of looking at things, Cultures are young, vibrant, alive, messy, and creative. Civilizations, on the other hand, are old, stodgy, dead, orderly, and derivative. We're going to talk more about this lifecycle as we go, but the most helpful bit to take away is the thought that Cultures are alive and fresh and still working things out, whereas Civilizations are (spiritually) old and tired, even if they are materially on top of the world. The example that most helps me is that Spengler placed the Classical Culture from roughly the Doric period (~1100 BCE) until Alexander (~323 BCE), and pretty much <i>all</i> of non-mythical Roman history was in its Civilization phase. One of the most interesting, most studied periods of human history, at least in the West, nearly 600 years, was all in the "dead" phase of Civilization.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3fd7a34">
  <p>
  As you can see, Spengler had a few different ways of comparing Cultures/Civilizations. The toughest to fit together is the Spiritual Epochs with the other two, but roughly speaking, "Spring" is the Early Period of the Culture and "Summer" is the Late Period, and then the Civilization is split between "Autumn" and "Winter." The tables in the book list examples for each segment from different Cultures/Civilizations (Indian, Egyptian, Chinese, Classical, Arabian, and Western), to give a feeling of what he means by the labels I've copied above. There's a lot of terms that might be a bit head-scratching without Spengler's spelling them out in the work, like what he means by "Form" and so forth, but the general idea comes out pretty clearly: early on in a Culture, the folk have a way of seeing/understanding things that they just <i>have</i> to find a way to make real. This drives them to make all kinds of art and architecture and to come together into a political unit. Eventually, this unit solidifies and has command over great material resources, but has lost its ability to tap into deeper spiritual truths.

  <p>
  So, according to Spengler, the West was moving into the "Early Autumn" or first phases of "Civilization" in the early 20th century, and so we're just a bit further along that curve here about 100 years later. So, we're maybe in the "Caesarism" phase politically (charismatic leaders use the love of the people to seize absolute power), we are somewhere in between rebelling against the artistic forms our Culture developed and emptily aping them, and our philosophical thinking is in the highly abstract phase. I don't know that I'd say this is <i>obviously</i> true, but it's hard to say it's impossible. Whether you agree with this placement or not, the thought that different Cultures/Civilizations follow different arcs, and that we might place our own by careful attention to the past is a useful one, and I hope you find the above tables fruitful in the exercise.

  <p>
  Last year, as part of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">"read only books by dead authors"</a> challenge, I read
  both Volumes of Oswald Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>. I found it very
  interesting and helpful, but it was not what you would call an easy read. So, I
  thought I'd spend a few posts doing my best to put forth the most helpful
  thoughts from the book in a way that might be a little more handy. Also, it will
  help me get those ways of looking at the world settled into my own head, so even
  if I don't succeed at the first, I'll at least have the other one going for me.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, in case you don't know, let's go over who Oswald Spengler is and what was
  his magnum opus. Spengler was a German thinker and writer with rather broad
  knowledge who lived and wrote around the turn of the 20th century. <i>The Decline
  of the West</i> was published in 1918 (first volume) and 1922 (the second). When
  first published, it made a huge stir, everyone educated was talking about it,
  responding to it, and arguing about it, but these days, you mostly only hear
  about him from folks with tastes in less mainstream takes on history. The core
  thesis of the book is that groups of humans (Cultures) have a distinctive
  lifecycle, like a living thing, this cycle includes growing old and dying, and
  that Western civilization is starting into that old age. You might assume from
  the publication date that this was just a reaction to WWI, but he actually
  completed volume I on the eve of the Great War, and for obvious reasons couldn't
  get it published until it was over.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before we talk about Spengler's view of history and the world, let's take a tick
  to think about why he's forgotten by most folks these days. The first reason you
  might have already guessed: he was a right wing German in the early 20th
  century, and that's not exactly a popular description these days. Spengler
  didn't much care for Hitler or the Nazis, but he <i>was</i> a German nationalist in the
  days before that got stamped out of the country hard. The second reason is that
  his theories deal with the differences between "races," another view of the
  world not so much in fashion these days. Interestingly, he thought that "race"
  had more to do with the land and culture and less to do with biology, but that's
  a nuance that most folks don't get to with him. The last reason I'd point out,
  though, might be the most interesting: massive cultural cognitive dissonance.
  What do I mean? Well, already in Spengler's day, but even more so today,
  "Progress" is the core tenet of faith in Western Culture. Everything has been
  getting better since as far back as we can look and will just keep getting
  better forever. "From the caves to the stars." Well, Spengler took a big ol'
  dump all over this way of looking at the world. So, his thinking was rejected by
  the culture as a whole, for being incompatible with its core beliefs. That's
  just what makes him so interesting and potentially useful, of course.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before we can dig into why he thought the West was/would be in decline, we have
  to understand Spengler's whole way of looking at the world. Spengler's
  intellectual hero was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He looked to Goethe as a model
  of how to understand the world - through science, history, literature, and best
  of all, through a well-rounded, holistic view that took all of these into
  account. This is a fundamentally <i>qualitative</i> way of understanding, and the West
  spent most of the years between Goethe's time and Spengler's working out how to
  understand as much of the world as possible <i>quantitatively</i>. Spengler respected
  what these approaches could do, and acknowledged a lot of discoveries that came
  out of them, but he felt that the mania for quantification had crowded out the
  qualitative approach that allows for truly <i>understanding</i> large, messy topics. It
  is due to this qualitative approach that <i>Decline of the West</i> is sometimes called
  "unscientific," but I would argue that it is instead scientific in an older
  way - eighteenth century philosophers would have recognized this work as plenty
  scientific, as it is based on a lot of careful empirical observation and drawing
  generalizations from those.
  </p>

  <p>
  One method of qualitative science that Spengler relies on extensively, in fact
  that provides the framework for the whole work, is <i>morphology</i>, and this is the
  bit of Spengler's thinking I'd like to focus on in this post. His approach in
  the book is to look at the various cultures of the world and throughout history
  as if each is a living being and to look at the structural elements of those
  beings. Let's take a tick to ground this in the field Spengler borrowed the
  approach from: biology. Let's say that you want to look at both domestic cows
  and wild buffalo and find out what's alike and what's not between them. You
  could go out in the field and watch some of both kinds of animals and take
  careful note of how they behave. You'd see some likenesses, like that both
  animals spend a lot of time grazing, gather in herds, and so forth, but you'd
  also see some differences - like the cows going into a barn when it got cold, or
  being herded around by a dog. This would be an ethological approach. On the
  other hand, you might bring one of each animal into the lab and start taking
  measurements. You might even cut them apart and start looking at their organs
  and bones, seeing how they're shaped, how they fit together, and how they're
  linked. This would be a morphological approach. Both ways give you an
  understanding of the animals, and you'd learn a lot of the same stuff from both,
  since you are still looking at the same animals, but you'd also learn some
  things from one approach and not the other.
  </p>

  <p>
  Most history might be thought of as "human ethology" - it focuses on the
  behavior of individuals and groups, what they did, when they did it, what kind
  of motivations they had, what consequences did they have to live with, and so
  forth. Spengler instead wanted to look at history morphologically - what are the
  "parts" of the history of different cultures, how are they structured, how do
  they fit together, and so forth. The idea is that if you see a period of history
  in both the ancient Mediterranean and in China where charismatic leaders ride a
  wave of approval from the masses into supreme leadership, well, the history of
  both cultures has the same "part," despite some differences, the same way you
  could morphologically recognize a wing in a bat and a bird and work out that
  they're functionally similar despite the differences.
  </p>

  <p>
  So Spengler surveyed the vast expanse of history that he was familiar with and
  looked for what was happening <i>structurally</i>. What he found was that each Great
  Culture he had knowledge of had similar "parts," those parts happened in the
  same order, and they had similar durations. Put all this together, and you have
  a "lifecycle" for the "organisms" that are human cultures. You can look at when
  a culture came together and started doing things its own distinct way, and then
  match up certain parallel developments with how long after the start they
  happen, and you start to see a common arc - early vigorous frothing as groups
  within the culture jockey with each other, coming together into the full
  flowering of its cultural viewpoint, then things start hardening and become more
  focused on material gain, and then you get a Civilization with a lot of nice
  things, still going through the motions of its more vigorous younger self, but
  not truly doing anything new, and eventually that falls apart, and at best, you
  have folks who claim the old identity, but they are a shadow of what they once
  were, likely under the influence of some other Culture/Civilization with more
  power.
  </p>

  <p>
  We're going to talk more about Spengler's cultural life cycle in some upcoming
  posts, but for now I want to focus on the method of morphology specifically. It
  takes some judgment - bat wings and bird wings both allow flight through the
  adaptation of super long "finger" bones, and so are pretty easy to rule as
  "morphologically similar." But what about insect wings? These are still
  structures that allow flight, but they are made of wholly different materials
  and function in a wholly different way. Whether you decide to rule them
  "morphologically similar" will have something to do with why you're examining
  these structures. If you're trying to understand how flight works at all, then
  identifying very different ways different living things have been able to make
  it happen might be useful, and counting all "wings" as "similar" might be
  worthwhile. On the other hand, if you're trying to identify how flight evolved
  in different groups, you might not even count bats and birds as "morphologically
  similar," because they are from such far apart branches of the tree of life and
  obviously evolved at different times in different ways. This brings us back to
  Spengler's qualitativeness - much of why he is called "unscientific" is because
  he makes a lot of judgments about what counts as "similar" - if you look at his
  theory and don't find it plausible, you might see it as him fitting facts to
  theory. In his defense, he was a <i>fantastically</i> well-educated polymath who really
  did know a hell of a lot about a lot of different things, and all of that was
  grounded in aesthetic/qualitative engagement with art, literature, philosophy,
  and the like, so his judgments are not <i>naive</i>, but they <i>are</i> still judgments that
  others might disagree with.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, why did I want to spend a whole post just on "morphology"? Well, it's a
  helpful way of looking at things that has largely fallen out of favor in
  scientific circles, and with so many fields striving to be as "scientific" as
  they can, even those that morphology comes more naturally to have emphasized it
  less. Here's one classic example: from Aristotle onward, it's been a standard
  part of the study of politics to look at the structure of a government or a
  piece thereof - monarchy, oligarchy, or democracy. The United States
  Constitution was built on such morphological grounds - make the Executive branch
  like a monarchy, the Legislative like a democracy, and the Judicial like an
  oligarchy. If you held yourself to only looking at the behavior of specific
  politicians, you'd miss some important things about how the US government works.
  A less orthodox example is for creativity - for example, I took a look at one
  take on what defines Cyberpunk structurally and then applied those
  characteristics in a novel way to my D&amp;D setting, Fellhold.
  </p>

  <p>
  Obviously, history is another field where a morphological approach can be
  helpful, and we'll see more implications of this as we talk through more of
  Spengler's points.

  <title>Woden's Three Deals</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-April-23
  </p>

  <p>
  Lately, I've been giving some thought to a thread that seems to run through
  three of the best-known tales about Woden. The three tales I have in mind are
  when Woden gives up his eye for a drink of Meomer's (Mimir's) Well, when he
  hangs himself upon the World Tree to find the Runes, and when he brings back the
  Mead of Poetry to Esegeard (Asgard). These tales will already be well known to
  anyone familiar with Germanish lore, most of all those folks who call upon
  Woden. I was looking back over them as I started work on a new <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of
  Fallhall's prayer</a>. As I read back through them and thought about how I might
  build them into my new prayer, I found a thread of liknesses between these
  tales, but what grabbed me even more was that there was one spot where the
  thread was <i>not</i> clear, but instead murky. So, after bethinking (meditating) on
  this murky bit, I'm writing this post to try to work out what's going on there.
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, first off, let's do a quick run through of what happens in these tales.
  The most straightforward one, and the one that sets the stage for the thread I'm
  drawing between them, is Woden giving his eye for a drink from the Well of
  Memory. It is told in <i>Voluspa</i> 28 and in <i>Gylfaggining</i> 14. To gain a drink from
  this Well, which brings great Wisdom, Woden gives one of his eyes to its keeper,
  Meomer. While there are some other takes, such as that by putting his eye in the
  Well, Woden has ongoing insight into the memories of all beings in all the
  worlds, and thus ever-deepening wisdom, this tale is most often seen as Woden
  paying a very high price for a drink of great worth linked with the wisdom that
  is Woden's key attribute.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, we have Woden giving himself to himself as a sacrifice upon the World Tree
  in order to win the Runes, as told in <i>Havamal</i> 138-141. He hangs (likely
  literally hanged, as this was the most often found kind of sacrifice to Woden -
  hanging), wounded by a spear, for nine nights upon the World Tree. He looks
  "down" and comes back "up" with the Runes. So, once again, we have Woden paying
  a high price for something of great worth linked with wisdom, but here the Runes
  rather than a drink. What's interesting, though, is that the <i>root</i> of the World
  Tree is called out by name here, and we know that at least one of the roots goes
  to Wyrd's Well. We also know that the Wyrds are the ones who carved the Runes
  into the tree in the first place, and the Runes are deeply linked with the Wyrds
  and their Well. So I do not think it is crazy to consider that at least one part
  of winning the Runes was a drink from the Well of Wyrd.
  </p>

  <p>
  By now, you can likely see where I'm going with this, most of all since the last
  of these three tales is so <i>very</i> clearly about getting a drink of great worth
  linked with wisdom. I'll tell this tale in bit more depth, in part since we <i>have</i>
  more depth, but also since it might help with working out the murky bit we're
  closing in on. The Mead of Poetry has a somewhat winding backstory, which is
  given most thoroughly in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> 1 and is referenced in <i>Havamal</i> 104-110.
  When the Ese (Aesir) and Wen (Vanir) came together in frith (peace) after their
  war, they all spat into a vat (maybe after chewing some berries, more in a tick)
  and from the spit shaped a man called Kvasir. There is some thinking that the
  roots of the word Kvasir are linked with a kind of berry that was used to make a
  ritual heady drink in elder times. At any rate, Kvasir is the wisest of all
  men/Gods, and he wanders the world helping folks out and answering whatever they
  ask. A couple of dwarves, though, by the names of Fjalar ("Hider" or "Deceiver"
  most likely, but meaning is unsettled) and Galar ("Screamer") kill Kvasir and
  brew his blood into mead (the tellings we have don't say why). This is the Mead
  of Poetry, and drinking it brings great wisdom. These dwarves aren't through
  killing folks yet, though, and they also kill the ettin ("giant") Gilling ("The
  Noisy One", or again, "The Screamer") by taking him out rowing in a boat and
  sinking it, letting him drown, and then his mourning wife by dropping a
  millstone on her. Nasty bit of work, these two. Well, Gilling's son Suttung
  ("Heavy With Drink," but here again, meaning unsettled) does what is looked for
  from kinsfolk in those days and comes to get some kind of wergeld from the
  dwarves. He puts them on a rock that floods at the high tide and told them to
  give him the Mead of Poetry if they want to get off before they drown, and so he
  gets it. Suttung then takes the mead in three holders, <i>Son</i> (either
  "Reconcilliation" or "Blood," both of which seem linked with what happened to
  Kvasir), <i>Bodhn</i> ("Vessel"), and <i>Odhroerir</i> ("The One That Stimulates to Ecstasy",
  likely first the name of the Mead of Poetry itself, but Snorri interpreted a bit
  of <i>Havamal</i> as meaning it was the cauldron that held it), and puts it under the
  mountain <i>Hnitbjorg</i> ("Colliding Rocks") warded by his daughter, Gunnlodh
  ("Invitation to Battle").
  </p>

  <p>
  All that backstory before Woden even comes into the tale! Woden sets out to get
  the Mead, and along the way, he comes upon nine thralls (slaves) mowing grass
  for hay with scythes. He pulls out a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">whetstone</a> and sharpens all of their
  scythes. They give the newly sharpened tools a try and are very happy with how
  much better they work, so they all want to buy it, each putting forth what
  outlay he thinks will get him the stone. Woden, though, instead throws the stone
  up into the air, and the thralls clumsily get after it, and in the ruckus slit
  each other's throats. Woden goes on his way and finds their owner, who "just so
  happens" to be Suttung's brother Baugi ("Ring Shaped"). Baugi is grousing about
  losing all his thralls and wondering how he's going to get all the work on his
  holding done. Woden says he'll do the work of nine men all summer long, if Baugi
  can get him a drink of the Mead of Poetry. Baugi tells him that his brother
  Suttung keeps it all to himself, and so he doesn't know if he'll be able to get
  a drink for Woden, but he'll at least try. So, Woden spends the summer doing the
  work of nine thralls, and sure enough, gets it all done, so Baugi takes him to
  see Suttung. Surprising no one, Suttung tells them "hell no" when they ask for a
  taste of the mead. Thanks to the work Woden did, though, he gets Baugi to help
  him get into the mountain to get at the mead. Baugi pulls out the drill Rati
  ("Drill," cleverly enough) and begins drilling into the mountain. He stops and
  says the hole is good to go, but Woden blows into it and sees that the dust and
  rock chips fly back out toward him, which shows that the hole doesn't go all the
  way through, so he tells Baugi to keep going. Again, Baugi says it's good, this
  time the dust flies through, so Woden turns into a snake to go through the hole,
  and for some reason, Baugi tries to stab him with the drill, but he dodges and
  gets through the hole and into the mountain.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once inside, Woden turns back into a man and finds Suttung's daughter Gunnlodh
  guarding the Mead. To give him a drink, she asks him to spend three nights with
  her, and he agrees. After the three nights, she seats him on a golden stool and
  offers him each of the three holders of the Mead. Woden, though, takes huge
  drinks and drains all three in one sip each. He then flees the mountain, holding
  the Mead inside himself, and turns into an eagle to fly back to Esegeard.
  Suttung also turns into an eagle and gives chase. Woden gets back to Esegeard
  and spits out the Mead into waiting holders, and so now the Ese have the Mead of
  Poetry. Snorri tells us that Woden made it just in time, but not what Suttung
  did after (was he killed like Thjazi chasing after Idun? Did he fly away in
  shame?). He <i>does</i> tell us that it was such a close call that Woden pissed out
  some of the Mead, and this is where <i>bad</i> poetry comes from.
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, so why have I gone into so much depth with this tale, after dealing
  with the others so shortly? Well, first off, we <i>have</i> a longer telling of this
  tale than the others. Through some putting together of having poems to hand we
  no longer have, known kennings, and his own creativity, Snorri spun this one in
  far more depth than the others. Anyhow, I've given all this so thoroughly since
  I do not know what might be weighty and what not, with the business at hand.
  What is that business? Well, I have the inkling that this tale follows the same
  framework as the other two, but maybe less markedly. There is not at first blush
  a <i>Well</i>, and it is not altogether clear what <i>price</i> Woden paid, but we again deal
  with Woden going on a quest to get a drink linked with Wisdom that becomes one
  of his hallmarks. For the link, I'm indebted to Maria Kvilhaug in her <i>Maiden
  with the Mead</i> and <i>Yggdrasil's Seed</i>. She shows many of the parallels between the
  many tales of a Male Seeker going through hardships to reach a Maiden, who gives
  Him a drink of Mead which gives some wonderful quality. Well, there's not a
  clear maiden in the tale of Meomer's Well, not a clear drink in the winning of
  the Runes, and not a clear Well in the winning of the Mead of Poetry, but there
  are some hinting links.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, I think it is the "drink" that is likely the common bond between these
  tales. This one is fairly readily dealt with: as I said above, the Runes are
  <i>very</i> closely linked with the Well of Wyrd, maybe <i>the</i> foremost of "cosmological
  wellsprings of drink" in Germanish lore. As such, the thought that at least one
  bit of how Woden won the Runes was to drink from this Well is not so
  far-fetched. So that gets us a "drink" in all three tales. Next, we have the
  lack of a Maiden at the Well of Memory. This one is a bit trickier. Gunnlodh is
  very prominently shown in the tale of the Mead of Poetry, Wyrd (Old Norse <i>Urdhr</i>)
  is the eldest of the Three Wyrds (Wyrd, Werdhende, and Sculd), and so is implied
  in the Winning of the Runes, if we accept the link to the Well of Wyrd, but what
  of Meomer's Well? I don't have a straightforward answer here. Meomer is (maybe)
  an ettin, is (maybe) Woden's maternal uncle, and is (definitely) an initiatory
  figure. In many of these "Maiden with the Mead" tales, the Maiden has a male
  warder figure. The best I can do is that Meomer's Well has the warder, but not
  the Maiden, at least as told to us. That leaves us with the Well. This might be
  even more of a stretch than the bit about the Maiden, but bear with me. One of
  the things that struck me about the first two tales is that they have two of the
  three Wells given as watering the three roots of the World Tree. Meomer's Well
  and Wyrd's Well are both straightforward enough, but where is <i>Hvergelmir</i>? Well,
  Kvilhaug puts forward that these Mead-giving Maidens are often in the
  Underworld, and may or may not be figures of Death themselves. Hvergelmir is in
  the Underworld. One of the Maidens linked with this mythic complex in
  complicated ways is Idun, and one of her kennings is "The Keeper of the Sun of
  Hvergelmir." I'm not arguing anything as simple as "Gunnlodh is Idun," but I do
  think there's enough thematic overlap to make this case: Gunnlodh lives under a
  mountain and plays a role similar to other "Underworld Maidens," making it not
  crazy that she is a death/Underworld figure. If so, a link with the Well of the
  Underworld (Hvergelmir) would not be crazy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so, however flimsily, we now have a link between drinks from the three
  Wells that feed the World Tree that Woden took. At two of them, he paid a clear
  price (his eye and his life), but at the third, the price is not as clear. Is it
  the three nights with Gunnlodh? Given that she isn't said to be ugly or
  terrible, and none of the latter day drawings of her felt that she should be
  either, this doesn't seem like much of a "cost." One thought is that the <i>Havamal</i>
  telling might hint that Woden <i>married</i> Gunnlodh and then skipped out on her once
  he got the Mead as a dowry. If this reading is right, then might the cost be
  giving up his word/good name/wedded life with Gunnlodh? Maybe the cost is the
  summer Woden spent working for Baugi. If so, was the price paid the work itself,
  or the giving up of status in allowing himself to be a thrall? Does the
  whetstone have anything to do with it? How about Kvasir's backstory? And what of
  all this drilling and double crossing stuff?
  </p>

  <p>
  Right now, I'm leaning toward some combination of lowering Himself to thralldom
  and actually doing the work of nine men as the initiatory "price" paid by Woden
  for the Mead of Poetry, but I haven't wholly settled on that. I have the
  niggling feeling that I'm missing something in the symbolism of the tale. If you

  <p>
  So, I was reading thinking about the three wells from which the roots of
  Yggdrasil, the World Tree, draw their sustenance, as one does. It struck me that
  Woden paid a high price and gained something from at least two of the three,
  giving up his eye for a drink from Meomer's Well and giving up his life to wrest
  the Runes from Wyrd's Well, but what, then, of Hvergelmir? I wondered if maybe
  Woden's <i>other</i> famous drink, the Mead of Poetry, might somehow be linked here.
  Sure enough, poking around Maria Kvilhaug's <a href="https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/23958/18497.pdf">Maiden and the Mead</a> and <a href="https://the3littlesisters.com/catalog_explorer/the-seed-of-yggradsill/">The
  Seed of Yggdrasil</a>, she proposes just such a link. Now, that led me to wonder
  "what did he pay for that drink?" The ready answer is the three nights he spent
  with Gunnlodh, but that hardly seems to go in the same category as
  self-mutilation and sacrifice. Wondering this led me to look again at the rest
  of the myth, as told in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, and it once again
  struck me that there's a bunch of little details that seem. . . odd. One of
  which is a scene featuring a whetstone, which reminded me that there's another
  myth prominently featuring a whetstone (Thor's duel with the giant Hrungnir),
  which led me to ask myself, Jerry Seinfeld style, "what's the deal with
  whetstones?"
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgf1a08ad"></a>Odin's One Weird Trick to Get a Summer Job<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1a08ad">
  <p>
  First off, the bit of the tale that got me started down this road: on his way to
  get some of the mead, Odin meets nine thralls mowing grass with scythes. (Aside:
  I'm switching to all Norse names for telling the tale, since that's the version
  we have. Maybe sometime I'll get into how I treat Old Norse vs Old English vs
  modern Englished names of the Gods). Odin pulls out a whetstone and offers to
  sharpen up their scythes. They agree, and once he does, they do a few test
  swings and are thrilled - the scythes work <i>way</i> better now. All nine of them want
  to buy the whetstone, each putting forth what he's willing to pay. Instead of
  taking any of these deals, Woden throws the whetstone up in the air, and in
  their clumsy haste to snatch it up, they all kill each other with their newly
  razor-sharp scythes. As "luck" would have it, these nine thralls belonged to the
  brother of the giant who has the mead, and Odin offers to do the work of nine
  men over the summer if Baugi can get him a taste of that mead. Baugi says
  "sorry, man, my brother has it and he won't even share it with me, but I'll see
  if I can get him to let you have some."
  </p>

  <li><a id="org93d8b07"></a>Stephen Mitchell to the Rescue - Whetstones Stand for Authority<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org93d8b07">
  <p>
  So, what the heck is going on here besides a weird fairy-tale kind of excuse for
  Odin to get an "in" with sons of Gilling? I've long wondered this, but never
  strongly enough to run it down, until now. I took a look at a bunch of my
  <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#list_of_books_on_germanish_belief_with_thoughts">books</a>, and found some intriguing hints, but nothing really satisfying. Then
  through a shot-in-the-dark web search ("whetstones in Norse myth"), I found "The
  Whetstone as Symbol of Authority in Old English and Old Norse" by Stephen A.
  Mitchell, which pretty much answered the very thing I was asking myself.
  Mitchell argues that whetstones were a symbol for kingly might across Germanish
  lands and for a very long time, drawing on archaeological, linguistic, and
  written evidence. He believes this claim for a few linked reasons: 1. widespread
  metaphorical linkage between "sharpness" and wits, 2. kings were often symbolic,
  or even literal, "weapon givers", 3. whetstones were used by smiths, who were
  magic and holy, and 4. there's seems to be a Proto-Indo-European link between
  some kind of "stone" and the sky/it's chief God.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, all of the Germanish tongues use words for sharp/sharpen/hone to mean
  both that someone is clever or witful, but also as verbs meaning to "egg on" or
  "incite" (the "egg" there, by the way, is a borrowing from Old Norse from a word
  that means <i>to sharpen</i>, but the English phrase comes straight from Old Norse
  usage). You can see how these would be key king skills, and sure enough, in the
  sagas, we see Kings who are good at their job doing these very things, and kings
  who are bad at their job either not doing them, or doing them poorly. King
  Canute's worthless older brother was called "Harald Hein," <i>Hein</i> being a cognate
  for "hone," in the same way that he might have been called "tiny" if he was very
  fat. So, we know that the way folks talked and thought in lands where Germanish
  tongues were spoken saw "sharpness" and "sharpening" as things that go with
  kingship.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, among such warlike folk, Kings often put swords in their followers hands,
  whether literally ("here's a sword - go kill that guy") or symbolically ("and
  where did the wealth to get such fine gear come from? Oh, that's right, the rich
  farmland I gave you"). Since swords were so closely linked with kings, anything
  to do with swords would likely be fair game for becoming a symbol of kingship.
  And whetstones did just that! In the well-known Sutton Hoo burial, they found a
  scepter with a piece of whetstone as the ball on the top of it (likely linked
  side thought: the scepter itself comes from hammers/clubs wielded by kings,
  which are themselves linked with the blunt weapon of the fighter of the Gods -
  Thor's Hammer, Hercules's club, and so forth). Besides the two myths I brought
  up, there are also two sagas where a whetstone stands for kingly might/right. In
  the Mead story, it might mean something that Odin uses a symbol of kingship to
  take out some thralls, but I haven't worked out wholly what that might be yet.
  </p>

  <p>
  Third, and now we're getting more mythological, from a very early time, smiths
  were seen as having awesome and uncanny powers, very likely with religious
  overtones. The whetstone is one of the tools of the metalworking trade, and so
  it likely took on some of this religious awe and mystery. Also, whetstones often
  throw off sparks, which look rather like lightning - bright, fast-moving light
  from nowhere that can start a fire. That might help to explain why Hrungnir
  brings a whetstone to a magic weapon fight. This link with the holy would likely
  strengthen the associations we talked about above, even if in later times it was
  not part of day-to-day life to see smiths as magic and/or holy, symbols can
  linger on for a very long time after the association that led to it being a
  symbol is forgotten - like scepters as signs of kingly might/right and the clubs
  they were based on.
  </p>

  <p>
  Lastly, Mitchell points out the comparative evidence from far-flung
  Indo-European tongues that some words for "stone" and "sky" have the same root.
  There are also some mythological parallels. What's striking about the four
  Germanish tales we have about whetstones, though, is that <i>three</i> of them show the
  stone somehow moving through the air - Odin throwing it up high, Hrungnir
  throwing his at Thor, and in <i>Gautrek's Saga</i>, the king throws a whetstone at his
  hawk to get it back to work. So, if we buy that the sparks from whetstones were
  linked with lightning and that the "stone" linked etymologically with "sky"
  could be a whetstone, then these stories of hurled whetstones likely come from a
  story about some kind of holy whetstone moving through the air (clouds? the sun?
  I dunno).

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org52a0959">
  <p>
  I haven't had time to really let this sink in yet - for one thing, I want to
  bethink (meditate) at least a few times on all of these tales, what they share,
  how they are unalike, and so forth. I still haven't worked out what the link is
  to Odin's payment for the mead, but I did <i>at last</i> unknot something that had been
  bugging me for years, so I call that a win.

  <li><a id="orgc573746"></a>Lead-In: What is Narcissism?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc573746">
  <p>
  (The post's name is a joke, by the way. Lest I die of maximum irony, I don't
  plan on talking about myself much here.)
  </p>

  <p>
  For the past few weeks, I spent most of my spare time going through the archives
  of <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/archives.html">The Last Psychiatrist</a>, a "post-rationalist" blog written by, you guessed it,
  a psychiatrist. It's wide-ranging, covering everything from in-depth breakdowns
  of studies on psychiatric medication to write ups of pop culture. One thread,
  though, became maybe his main theme, and it pulled me in and wouldn't let go:
  Narcissism. The likeness he paints of this way of seeing the world and how rife
  it is in today's America seemed worryingly spot-on. Ready to become deeply
  worried about yourself, your friends and family, and your culture? Then climb
  aboard.
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, let's lay out what he means by "narcissism," as what he's talking
  about is neither what most folks mean when they say the word, nor what the DSM
  calls "Narcissistic Personality Disorder." For The Last Psychiatrist (hereafter
  "TLP"), narcissism does <i>not</i> mean "grandiosity" or "having a wildly overblown
  opinion of yourself." Instead, it means having an identity that you have
  more-or-less made up, rather than one that has grown out of what you <i>do</i>, and
  guarding that identity keenly. Folks who do this lean toward seeing themselves
  as the main character in their own story and anyone else as only backup
  characters. So far, so irksome, but so what? Well, when a narcissist's identity
  is threatened, the wonted answer is <i>rage</i> - anger wildly out of keeping with what
  set it off. When we're lucky, this is only a laughable shouting fit.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we're not, narcissists kill their whole family and then themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you'd like to get TLP's take in a (fairly) short shape, I'd steer you to <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2006/12/if_this_is_one_of_the_sexiest.html">this
  post</a> as the clearest "summary" (it's still pretty long). If you <i>truly</i> want to
  get his full take, with lots of examples of what he means, check out every post
  under "<a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/">Narcissism</a>". Even there, many of his other posts not under that header
  still touch on it. If you're willing to settle for my take, read on for a
  (fairly) short rundown.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgfb689cc"></a>Identity<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfb689cc">
  <p>
  So, the root of narcissism seems to be a "constructed" identity. "I am a rebel"
  or "I am a sensitive artist" or "I am a no-nonsense businessman" or whatever.
  These tend to be at least somewhat conscious - it's how you think of yourself,
  whether or not you explicitly put a label on it (but you likely do). What's so
  bad about that, though? Well, the problem is what's behind these self-assigned
  identities: vast, yawning insecurity. You desperately <i>tell yourself</i> "I'm a
  sensitive artist" because deep down, you are worried that you are <i>nothing</i>. You
  feel adrift and meaningless, and you hope that if you convince everyone (but
  most of all yourself) that you <i>really are</i> a sensitive artist, that insecurity
  will go away. There's a catch 22 in all this, though: you know you're faking it.
  So, if other people <i>really do</i> start treating you like a sensitive artist: you
  get gallery showings, you're written up in snooty magazines, models and rich
  folks want to be seen hanging out with you, and so forth, you end up subject to
  Groucho Marx's famous quip: "I don’t want to belong to any club that would
  accept me as one of its members."
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's take a far more common example. You have a young man who wants to be the
  kind of guy that women like. After first longing for girls that he's afraid to
  talk to, he eventually works up the nerve to ask a few out, and he gets
  rejected. Rather than turning bitter and assuming it's them that don't see his
  greatness (another unfortunately common narcissistic type), he decides he'll
  work out what he's doing wrong. So he works out, starts dressing nicer, learns
  how to look and act confident, and then he asks out a beautiful girl, she says
  yes, it goes well, and they start dating. You might think he'd be like "hooray,
  I have successfully become the kind of man that women want! My identity is
  secure!" but you would very likely be wrong. Instead, for as long as things go
  well, part of him is thinking "did I just fool her into liking me?" and if the
  answer is "yes", then she's not a good source of validation, because she's too
  easily tricked. If the answer is "no", then she's not a good source of
  validation, because she's a bad judge of character - she likes this person that
  is so unlikable? What's wrong with her? It gets worse, though - even if all of
  that remains in the background or shut down, if/when things go badly and they
  break up, well, now he has "proof" that women don't really like him at all, or
  that all his work phony, or what have you.
  </p>

  <p>
  This will all likely either sound completely nuts or horrifyingly familiar. The
  problem was that our hypothetical dude was too focused on his "felt sense of
  identity" and not enough on "what are the things I've done and how do they
  compare to an external set of standards that I have internalized as truly
  important." Instead of asking "am I a guy girls want to be with?" it would have
  been better if he had learned to value <i>for itself</i>, being fit, being comfortable
  taking calculated risks, showing respect to himself and those around him by
  dressing well, treating romantic partners with love and respect, and so forth.
  That way, his sense of "who am I?" is not based on a <i>label</i> and is not based on
  "what does she think of me," but is instead based in "well, it's important to me
  to do certain things. Did I do them? Well, at least kinda, the best I could.
  Yeah, I fell down here and here, but I did a pretty good job there."
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf82a7cb"></a>Main Character<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf82a7cb">
  <p>
  One way that this guarding of identity shows up is that the narcissist sees
  himself as the lead character in his own movie or book, everyone else is only a
  background character. Of course, this is somewhat metaphorical, a way to talk
  about how a narcissist can't put himself in someone else's shoes. But <i>also,</i>
  thanks to the pop culture that raised us all, a lot of times this is very nearly
  literally true: a narcissist sees his life as a story, that it "must" have some
  deeper meaning right around the corner, and one day he'll be seen as the special
  hero he badly wants to be.
  </p>

  <p>
  This shows up as everything getting linked back to the narcissist. It's not
  about doing what's good for the children, it's about <i>am I be a good father</i>? It's
  not about acknowledging the grief of someone at the funeral, it's about <i>am I a
  supportive friend</i>? It's not about working with someone worthy that you love to
  build a life together, it's <i>am I the kind of man who would have a wife like
  this</i>?
  </p>

  <p>
  The more narcissistic someone is, the less it even crosses his mind to think of
  things any other way - what other ways of thinking even are there? Different
  ways of looking at me?
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to spot a narcissist in the wild, one good rule of thumb is to look
  for how many times he uses "I, me, my, mine." If you ask him about someone else,
  mark how quickly it gets linked back to what he knows or has done, or if you get
  a beat with puzzlement as he wraps his brain around this weird way of thinking -
  <i>other people's perspectives? Who knew</i>?
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf678eef"></a>Narcissistic Injury<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf678eef">
  <p>
  The worst thing that can happen to a narcissist is to be confronted with a
  threat to his identity. The "successful businessman" that is about to be exposed
  as faking it through massive debt. The "family values" politician about to be
  found out for having gay sex in airport bathrooms. The "promising young man"
  confronted with the fact that he is no longer young and he has squandered
  whatever promise he once had. The very worst threat to a narcissist's identity,
  though, is "who are you, again?" Things may be going <i>terribly</i> for a narcissist,
  but as long as he can tell himself the suffering is <i>about him</i>, then he's still
  the main character, his identity is intact as "persecuted hero" or
  "long-suffering stoic" or whatever. Telling your narcissistic husband than
  you're leaving him, getting into a screaming match about it, dragging it out
  through awful family court drama - all of that is, at least, still somewhat
  about him. If you just leave in the night and never speak to him again, just
  send the paperwork to be signed, no emotion, no reaction - <i>that</i> is a
  narcissistic injury.
  </p>

  <p>
  The frightening thing about narcissistic injury is, as I mentioned in the
  lead-in, it leads to <i>rage</i>. The unbearable tension between "who I <i>need</i> to think
  of myself as" with "here's evidence you're definitely not that guy" is resolved
  by lashing out at whomever is felt to most strongly be causing this tension. If
  a man thinks he's a good husband, but his wife points out to him he's never
  around, he doesn't help with the chores or the kids, and he doesn't even have a
  good job as an excuse for any of that, he's going to be <i>pissed</i> and it's going to
  be <i>at her</i>, because on some level he knows she's right. Again, the vast majority
  of the time, narcissistic injury leads to the equivalent of a temper tantrum -
  screaming, insults, accusations, and so forth. Sometimes, though, it can be much
  worse. If you go and look at what we know about folks who have done mass
  killings or killed their girlfriends/spouses/families (and often themselves
  after), it pretty much always becomes clear that it's about some identity and a
  threat to it. So, if you have someone in your life that this post seems to apply
  to more than you'd like, think very hard and be <i>very careful</i>. Maybe there's a
  gentle way to nudge them toward a less narcissistic outlook, or maybe you need
  to go. Whatever the case, think twice before you threaten them with public
  shame, anything that would make either the folks they care about most, or lots
  of folks (or both), see them as not what they want to think they are.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org06af0ac"></a>Help! I Think this Might Be Me<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org06af0ac">
  <p>
  First off, by this meaning, <i>everybody</i> is at least a little narcissistic, and you
  have to be. Secondly, if you're young (teens or twenties), more of this is
  developmentally normal. So don't give up on yourself yet.
  </p>

  <p>
  That being said, if some of this post left you feeling unsettled (as TLP's posts
  did for me), the way forward is both straightforward and very hard. As much as
  you can, you need to think of other folks as their own beings, with their own
  will, <i>not</i> as what they are to you, and you need to take more heed of what you <i>do</i>
  than "who I am". So, don't ask yourself "how can I be a better father?", instead
  ask "what can I do to help my daughters?" Don't say "I want to be more secure in
  myself", instead say "here's how my deeds stack up to an outside, measurable
  standard." As I said, straightforward, but hard.
  </p>

  <p>
  Journaling, therapy, meditation, and other ways of finding insights about
  yourself can help you come to know that this is something you might need need to
  work on, but it seems they don't do much to help you change since the <i>point</i> of
  narcissism is to ward off change. What's the way around this? Use your
  narcissistic leanings on behalf of something better and "fake it till you make
  it."
  </p>

  <p>
  Worried you have trouble seeing your kin as anything other than outgrowths of
  yourself? Then make the identity that you work so hard to guard that of
  "steadfast husband and father." Maybe it doesn't "feel true," you know you're
  faking it? So what? It's not for you! It's for them. If you want to be "a
  writer", well, start cranking words out, <i>most of all if it feels fake</i>. Just keep
  going. One day, you'll have a body of work, and instead of saying "I'm a
  writer", you can say "I wrote that." Lastly, adopting a more-or-less explicit
  code of ethics/behavior that is grounded in what you <i>do</i> rather than "who you
  are" seems like it ought to help - religion or other spiritual practice is
  likely helpful here, as long as it pushes you. If you find yourself using your
  religion to give yourself a pass - "I know I spent a week and thousands of
  dollars on hookers and blow, but Jesus still loves me, so my wife will too" -
  then you have yoked it to the narcissism.
  </p>

  <p>
  All of this is hard work, not least because our whole pop culture and the way we
  were raised pushes us toward narcissism, and if you're an adult, you've likely
  settled into it somewhat.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, if you want to do better, you have to ask: "who might I be hurting, and what
  can I do to stop?"

  <title>Last(?) "Hail Idun"</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-April-02
  </p>

  <p>
  Whew, I think I have <i>at last</i> gotten to the shape of the "Hail Idun" that I want to use for my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>. Those of you that have been following along have seen that it's taken rather a lot of tinkering to get here (and I didn't show all my work!), but I'm pretty happy with what I've gotten to, and my Rune casting says this ought to go well.
  </p>

  <p>
  A very big thanks to everyone who has shared feedback on my earlier tries at getting this right - all of your thoughts were very welcome, even if I didn't end up going with the words or thoughts you put forward, you still helped steer me toward what we have here. Of course, if you don't like it, that's all on me!
  </p>

  <p>
  As I believe I've said before, this prayer is rather idiosyncratic and builds on what has come out of my bethinking (meditation), divination, and worship. What might strike you as odd, though, is that I didn't put in anything about apples and did put in "ale." Mostly this comes from some of the kennings for Idun given by Snorri, such as "ale giver" and "drink willow." I've come to think (shaped somewhat by Maria Kvilhaug's thinking) that Idun is linked with the myths of Goddesses/Giantesses that ward/give drinks with magical/religious weight. The lack of apples is only since I wanted to keep in a link to Yggdrasil and to the "drink," and I ran out of room!
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Hail Idun,<br>
  Yggdrasil's Seed,<br>
  well-spoken wife of wordcraft,<br>
  wreathed in blessed blossoms.<br>
  <br>
  Holy Idun,<br>
  open our hearts<br>
  with ale's dearest drink<br>
  to awakening of everlasting life.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  I hope that you find this prayer helpful, whether to use as-is, or as a spur to coming up with your own. Either way, I'd love to hear how it goes.
  </p>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-March-26
  </p>

  <p>
  Back when I was about to get out of the Army, for a while I thought I was going to become a farmer. One of my good buddies turned me on to Joel Salatin, the founder of <a href="https://polyfacefarms.com/">Polyface Farm</a>, who has worked out a way to raise animals ethically, in a way that helps the environment, and make good money doing it. I was inspired and bought all his books (at the time). Looking back, there was more than a little wishful thinking involved, of course - I grew up in suburbia and have never raised/cared for animals that weren't pets. I ought to have found a way to "test drive" farming - go volunteer somewhere, keep some backyard chickens, that kind of thing. For better or worse, my wife was not so thrilled with the idea, so I found another way. Salatin's whole approach is pretty cool, but I want to share one piece of it here.
  </p>

  <p>
  Salatin manages to keep more cattle per acre than any of the neighboring farms. There's a few things that let him do this - like a commitment to building soil through composting and using the farm for more than just cattle - he raises sheep and pigs in a way that mimics a natural ecosystem, similar to Takao Furuno's approach described in <i>The Power of Duck</i>. The main way, though, is both counter-intuitive and simple: smaller paddocks. In case agricultural vocabulary is not one of your hobbies, a "paddock" is a fenced-in area for the keeping of livestock. When raising cattle, often folks will not just let them loose on their whole land, but will instead rotate them through a few paddocks. Salatin's paddocks at Polyface Farm are much smaller than those on most ranches. The result? More cows per acre.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sounds bad, right? "Cramming cows into smaller paddocks, forcing them to survive on less land! Open pastures!" That's not actually what's happening here, though. Do you know what cows do when given wide-open pastures? They spread way the hell out. Remember above when I mentioned ecosystems? Well, when you look at ruminants in the wild, what do they do? They huddle together while grazing. Why? Protection from predators. For many reasons, Salatin doesn't fill his farm with wolves, but he <i>does</i> want his cows to huddle together. See, it turns out that when cows spread out, they get very picky - they only eat the <i>tastiest</i> grass, and then they wander over, skip over all the iceberg-equivalent grass and go to the next clump of baby spinach. Cows need variety in their diets, though. If you let them eat anything they want from the full buffet, they skip a lot of what's available. On the other hand, when they're squished together with a bunch of other cows, they eat whatever's in reach before their neighbors can get to it. You've likely already guessed where this is going: smaller paddocks force cows to clump together, which makes them eat more of the available grass, so you get better efficiency while the cows eat just as well (actually better: the variety means more vitamins and the like). Not only do the cows eat more of the grass on the same acreage, you know what grass does over the spring and summer? It <i>grows</i>. Which means that you can rotate back to the same paddock after a few weeks. The smaller paddocks then also mean that you can rotate back sooner, which is even <i>more</i> efficiency. You have more cows, that are better fed, and therefore tastier, on the same amount of land, <b>and</b> the cows are even happier about it, than if you'd let them "roam free(ish)" on the entirety of your land.
  </p>

  <p>
  As an exercise for the reader, I encourage you to think about any other mammals that come to mind who are regularly allowed to spread out nearly as much as they like and do as they damn well please, but maybe were better off when circumstances constrained them to huddling together, finding every bit of value in the immediate space they could.

  A bit late tonight, as my kids were home for Spring Break and after they got to bed, my wife and I finished watching <i>The Sopranos</i> for the first time (very short thoughts: great show, stupid ending, though not inconsistent thematically). At any rate, I've been meditating on the words for my take on a "Hail Idun" all week, taking into account a lot of thoughts from the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/223141.html?thread=39594405#cmt39594405">feedback I got</a>. I think I'm getting closer, but I'm still not there, so here's three more takes:

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-March-12
  </p>

  <p>
  The first thing I have to say is that I'm not wholly happy with my thoughts below. I've read the book and I'm thinking about it, but I might need to do more to truly soak it in. I started writing this post to get those thoughts in order, and now that I've done so, some of it has come together, but other bits have stayed murky. That's all to say, I may come back to this book, and I don't know how long I'll stand behind what I have to say below - we'll see how things go!
  </p>

  <p>
  This book comes highly recommended in several "How to Heathen" books, like Galina Krasskova's <i>Modern Guide to Heathenry</i>. Written in 1982 by Paul C. Bauschatz, who seems to have been an English professor at the University of Maine and published by the University of Massachusetts press, it's <i>very</i> hard to find a copy to buy these days, but seems to be pretty readily available in large libraries (I checked out a copy from the university where I work). My guess is that it didn't get that big a print run, since it's a fairly niche topic, but then Heathens took to it and bought up all the copies and there's never been a reprint. I'm thinking about writing to the publisher to ask them to consider a reprint, given that if you can find a copy at all (checks <a href="https://www.alibris.com">alibris.com</a> - nope), it goes for (checks Amazon) at least $980. Seems like a market opportunity to me.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org5d6c1b8"></a>The Main Idea - Pre-Christian Germanish Folk Saw Time Very Unlike Us<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d6c1b8">
  <p>
  At any rate, why is this book so sought after by today's heathens? It sets out to explore the pre-Christian Germanish worldview, to try to understand what it was like "from the inside." Specifically, Bauschatz argues that the pre-Christian Germans had a <i>very</i> different conception of how time worked and that this is reflected in their myth, cultural practices and artifacts, and language. Since it turns out you can't really talk about fundamental conceptions of time without getting into cosmology, causality, and other pretty big topics, this turns out to have a lot of interesting things to say for folks interested in understanding Germanish beliefs and lore.
  </p>

  <p>
  So what is this very different way of thinking of time? In short, the Western Christian/post-Christian view of time is the familiar linear "past, present, future," and from a theological perspective, that line exists within an enclosing timeless eternity. Bauschatz didn't make this comparison, but I can't help but see the enclosing timelessness as Magian and the linear perception of time nested within it as Faustian, and the attempt to wed them together the outcome of the pseudomorphosis that produced European Christianity. The elder Germans, though, seem to have seen time as being made of "past and not-past," and of these, the past had far more weight. I'm still working my way through all of this, which is part of why I'm writing these thoughts down, but if I understand right, the main idea is that the importance of things can only be seen in hindsight. A lot of stuff happens, but most of it ends up being trivial - nothing that matters comes of it. Some things, though, become the causes for the events that matter.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org09bbaa6"></a>The Well and the Tree - Past Happenings and What Grows from Them<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09bbaa6">
  <p>
  So, what are the "Well" and the "Tree" in the name of the book? To my readers who know their way around Germanish Lore, this will be clear enough - the Well of Wyrd and the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. In the lore, the Yggdrasil is said to hold all of the world, and to have its roots in one or more wells, but the best known is the Well of Wyrd, or if you would rather have the Old Norse, <i>Urdhrbrunnr</i>. Now, that word <i>brunnr</i> doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean a "well" in the sense of a shaft dug deep into the ground, lined with stone, and with a bucket to draw water from it, as you likely think of when you hear "well." It seems to have been used to mean all of: wells, springs, streams, and catch basins. The heart of the meaning seems to have been "something from which drinking water is drawn." In today's Germanish tongues, it has mostly specialized to one of those meanings, and in English has almost wholly vanished, other than in a few steadnames that end in "-burn" or "-bourne." The three Norns who tend this "well" - <i>Urdhr</i>, <i>Verdhandi</i>, and <i>Skuld</i> in Old Norse (which is attested), or <i>Wyrd</i>, <i>Werthende</i>, and <i>Sculd</i> in Old English (which is a modern reconstruction) - may or may not have been a conscious borrowing of the Greek <i>Moirae</i> or "Fates," but the thought that the world is a Tree that grows out of a nourishing water source tended by (a) wise woman/women might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">very old indeed</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Bauschatz argues that these are mythological representations of the way that the elder Germanish folk thought of the world and time. He pulls together archaeological findings, artwork, story motifs, and the use of language to make his case. He does his best to reconstruct what that sense of world and time might have been like, since it seems like it might have been rather unlike how the folks of today see the world, and even more so unlike how we see time. The heart of what these represent to Bauschatz is the <i>containment</i> of the Well and the <i>branching</i> of the Tree. They are linked by a sense of life and growth. The Tree is kept healthy and growing by the water and mud of the Well, and the doings of the Worlds held in/made up by the Tree "fall down" into the Well and renew it. The "now" is the accumulation/fulfillment of everything that has come before, and so the past is at its "fullest" <i>right now</i>. The idea that things started out perfect and have been getting worse, that the world has been deteriorating in a way that will be washed away/renewed by some future event, seems to be wholly outside of how elder Germanish folks saw things.
  </p>

  <p>
  This leads to a few implications: first, the future is not set, but it's not wholly unguessable either. One way to put it might be that the elder Germanish folk would look at a batter hitting the ball and hear the bat hit the ball and see the form of the batter and think "wow, that might be a home run" rather than focusing on the outfielder running to catch the ball and wondering if he'll be at the right place at the right time. Secondly, learning what happened in the past is of great worth, because it's the best way you have of learning about how cause and effect work. Thirdly, doing great deeds lays the needed groundwork for great things to come - you renew the well and feed the tree when you leave great things behind you. These three things seem like a lot of why this book has so strongly struck today's heathens, and I can see why. 
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org81233b8"></a>The Linguistic Evidence - What Future Tense?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81233b8">
  <p>
  Very likely the source of Bauschatz's theory, and I suspect the bit that he was most interested in, is a grammatical observation about the German language family. Namely, grammatically-speaking, <i>no</i> Germanish tongue expresses the future morphologically. In fact, <i>every</i> Germanish tongue only conjugates its verbs into past and non-past. This part gets pretty technical, enough so that even as someone who took linguistics classes in College, majored in Latin and Greek, and has read a lot about the linguistic evidence for the origin and dispersal of Indo-European languages, I found it hard to follow.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's take a quick side trip into linguistic concepts and terminology in case the above paragraph read like gobbledygook to you. What do I mean about expressing grammatical concepts "morphologically"? First off, "morphological" is a fancy word for "in the shape of," and when used in linguistics is used to refer to the sounds made in a word, and is most of all used when the sounds of a word <i>change</i> to reflect some change in meaning. For example, "write" is in the present tense, but when I change the vowel to "o", we get "wrote", which is now in the past tense. That's a morphological change. So is making something plural by putting and "-s" on the end - like "kid" and "kids," or weirder changes like "child" and "children." So far, so good?
  </p>

  <p>
  Most Indo-European languages made/make morphological changes to words to convey what they are doing in a sentence grammatically. If you only speak English, this can be tough to get your head around, because we don't do much of that and instead express grammatical function by putting words next to each other - for example, to show who is writing, we put a pronoun next to the word "I write," "you write," and so forth. To show future tense, we add in "will" - "I will write." There's a variety of historical reasons for this that we can get into another time, but one of the contributing factors is what Bauschatz is getting into here, and we'll talk about that in a second.
  </p>

  <p>
  To make the idea of morphological changes to show grammatical function a little clearer, let's take a look at another language that does more than English - Latin. Here, <i>videbo</i> means "I will see" - the <i>vide-</i> bit is the root, meaning "see" and the <i>-bo</i> bit says "I will." If I wanted to say "I will be seen" (passive voice) or "if [something happened], I would see" (subjunctive), you'd make more changes to the verb (<i>videbor</i> and <i>videam</i> respectively). Morphological changes like this seem to have been a big part of how proto-Indo-European worked, which is why all Indo-European languages today make at least some morphological changes to words to convey grammatical meaning. What those changes were in proto-Indo-European is a matter of some debate, and harder to describe than the examples above, but Bauschatz goes into it in the book.
  </p>

  <p>
  The short version is that it seems like proto-Indo-European was doing <i>something</i> similar to tense with morphological changes, but that the various daughter languages evolved in slightly different ways. The Germanish kindred of tongues seems to have evolved to where you had a morphological past and a morphological "not past." Weird as it is to think about, they didn't seem to feel the need to express that something "will happen" in the future until they started being Christian. Take a closer look at how we put something in the future now: "I <i>will</i> write." We don't think about it much, but that "will" is <i>exactly</i> the same word as the will in "willpower." The sense is "I will it to happen," meaning "it is my intention right now to do that thing in the future." Every Germanish tongue has a similar "workaround" for expressing futurity - we slap some kind of helping verb onto a "not past" form of the main verb, and those helping verbs usually mean something like "have in mind" or "intend" or "am obliged to." Fun fact: "shall" as in "I shall do the thing," is etymologically linked with "should," which is the English cognate to the Norn "Skuld."
  </p>

  <p>
  Anyhow, Bauschatz argues that Germanish tongues lack a morphological "future tense" because the idea that you can talk about things in the future as if they're certain, established, "real," just in a different conceptual "place" was outlandish to the folks who spoke Proto-Germanic. The best they could do was to say "well, this is what I intend to happen" or "given what's happened, the most likely outcome seems to be this." As the speakers of these tongues Christianized, they had to grapple with a worldview that saw the future as a more definite thing, something that held the dearest hope of the new religion.

  <li><a id="orgb7dbe03"></a>Some Downsides - Academicese, Lack of Grounding in Ways of Belief<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb7dbe03">
  <p>
  Overall, I rather liked the book and it sparked a lot of thoughts, but it has some downsides. For starters, at times you can tell that this book was written in the 80s by an English professor, because it often (usually?) indulges in post-modern academic jargon when it could just state something plainly. Often enough that it's actually hard to follow at times. I can sympathize that Bauschatz's task is a tough one, trying to understand and describe a different way of understanding time and the world than you and your audience take for granted, but it often feels like he leans too hard into abstract terms and the way of talking about things that his field expected at the time to demonstrate you were a member in good standing. Secondly, Bauschatz is very clearly coming at this stuff from a way of looking at things that takes as given that these stories, these ways of thinking, and so forth are nothing more than stories made up to cope with the world, nor more or less true than anyone else's. When he dives deep, it is into the language used. He doesn't seem to give much weight to the stories as stories, as units of meaning with their own worth. There are pros and cons when a writer is a believer in the field being written about (and when not!), but here, I think Bauschatz's valiant attempts to understand what it was like to see the world as an elder German are undercut by his unwillingness to take seriously "what if some bits of how they saw the world were right? what if those things really are handled by Goddesses?

  <li><a id="orgf9d40af"></a>Closing - Deep and Thought-Sparking, but Clumsy<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf9d40af">
  <p>
  Overall, I think this book is well worth reading and sheds a lot of light on how time, causality, and "fate" are shown in the Germanish lore. That being said, it doesn't seem to do so in the clearest, most straightforward way it might. There are a lot of times where I found myself going "why don't you just say what you mean?" I had hoped this post might be a start toward re-stating the worthwhile insights in a more straightforward way, but I think there's more work to come on that front.

  <title>Jordan Peterson's Framework for Myth</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-March-02
  </p>

  <p>
  Well, after the comments on my <a href="https://jprussell.dreamwidth.org/2951.html">List of Germanish Books with Thoughts</a> went rather long and ended up taking a lengthy detour into discussing Jordan Peterson's way of understanding myths, as laid out in his book <i>Maps of Meaning</i> and in loads of lectures since, I reckoned it might be helpful to spell out that framework as clearly and straightforwardly as I might, because this is one area where I think Peterson is not at his strongest. So many of his lines of thinking and research are linked in his head and have implications for each other, he often fares far afield in a way that can be hard to follow, especially if you're new to his thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
  That being said, I once told a friend that if you listen to enough of Peterson's lectures, in at least one of them, he will spell out his way of thinking about a key topic from the very most bedrock concepts up to the widest implications, and he'll make every step as firmly supported as he knows how. Unfortunately, in every <i>other</i> lecture, he will just refer back to the higher-level implications and how they relate to the topic at hand. His more recent books <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, and presumably (I've yet to read it) <i>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</i>, do a decent job of laying things out in an order that makes sense and builds on each other, but with a lot less of the depth than <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, which I found a bit disappointing. At any rate, if I might flatter myself a moment, I've long felt like my (rather boring) super power is to be able to listen to questions folks have about a topic and understand what it is they're actually confused by, and therefore what answer would help resolve their confusion. I wouldn't have thought this was much of a super power, but after years being on both sides of a classroom, sitting through corporate meetings, attending military trainings and debriefs, and so forth, I've found that it's <i>really</i> common for folks trying to explain things to get a question, and then answer something way different, often while missing the fairly easy distinction the questioner was actually looking for. And so I set out, modestly, to try to more clearly set out the thinking of someone who has made himself known worldwide and rather wealthy by explaining things.
  </p>

  <li><a id="org1787b41"></a>We're Not Going to Talk About the Biological Grounding<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1787b41">
  <p>
  Okay, so if you dig into <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, a decent chunk of the book will be dedicated to explaining some concepts about neurobiology and animal behavior that Peterson wants to use as the foundation for everything that follows. His goal in laying all of this out is to give as firm a material grounding as he can to all of the symbolic and narrative stuff he talks about later. This section is interesting, impressive, and with what little I know of the field, seems pretty comprehensively argued. That being said, if you are <i>not</i> coming at this from a skeptical standpoint, if you already believe stories and myths include important information about what it means to live and how to do so as well as you might, you can likely skip over this. So that's just what we're going to do here: I'll give the <i>briefest</i> of summaries so that you can decide if you're interested in digging in more, but from this point on, I'll assume that you're okay with the premise "the structures of meaning (symbols, narratives, and so forth) within stories and myths give meaningful insights into how the human mind works and how to live a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">meaningful, worthwhile life.</a>" If you don't agree with that premise, I humbly invite you to read my thoughts on finding meaning in life by following that last link.

  <li><a id="orgf2eac65"></a>The Very Short Rundown of the Biological Grounding<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf2eac65">
  <p>
  At least in vertebrates (and maybe even in invertebrates, hence Peterson's infamous thing with the Lobsters), animals seem to have two groundmost motivational systems: to move toward good things and away from bad things. Moving toward good things produces a bunch of feel-good reward chemicals, like dopamine, and moving away from bad things seems to relieve a bunch of feel-bad chemicals that cause anxiety and stress, like cortisol. This leads to a world full of known good and bad things, to which we more or less know how to react, but then an even wider world of the unknown, which holds vast amounts of both good and bad things. As such, we can react to "the unknown" with either the "moving toward good things" motivational system, or with "moving toward, not away from, bad things" anti-reward system. For beings with things like symbols and narratives (like us), we can somewhat choose how we conceptualize of the known and unknown in order to get more of what we want and less of what we don't - are we being forced out into the darkness full of monsters ready to eat us by harsh necessity? Or are we striding into a realm of possibility, ready to handle any obstacles along the way? The former will produce a lot of anxiety and little sense of reward/meaning, whereas the latter will feel full of reward/meaning with minimal anxiety.
  </p>

  <p>
  Got it? Hooray, we just covered roughly the first 13 chapters out of 68 of <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (~84 pages of 469).

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d71cdc">
  <p>
  The next big thing to get out of the way before we talk about the framework itself is that Peterson is first and foremost a synthesizer. He'll be the first to admit that most of the ideas he shares are outgrowths and remixes of the thinking of folks he admires. He has a <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/">big ol' recommended reading list</a> if you want to delve deeper into where his thinking is coming from.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most important thing to know, though, is that Peterson's method of analyzing myth is about 80-90% Jung, with a good seasoning of Nietszche, and then finished out with his other influences. In other words, I mainly think of "Peterson's" analytical framework for myths as a very helpful introduction/guide to understanding myths from a Jungian standpoint. The framework below relies on Jung's concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">"archetypes"</a>, patterns of behavior, symbolism, and association that appear to be very deeply embedded in human brains and that show up in a variety of forms across many cultures and throughout time. For example, the father in the story of the Prodigal Son, Jupiter of Roman myth, and Mufasa from the Lion King all share characteristics of the "Father" archetype - they act in ways fathers often act, they symbolize things fathers tend to symbolize, and they are associated with things fathers tend to be associated with, and in all three case, those actions, symbols, and associations have a lot in common (controlled/protective aggression, warmth and indulgence to children, enforcer of rules, and so forth). Where I think Peterson is helpful is in giving an underlying conceptual framework for how the different archetypes interact with each other in a more systematic way than Jung was willing or able to do (more on the pros and cons of this in a second).
  </p>

  <p>
  Nietzsche maybe does less to create the shape of the framework or the pieces within it, but his thinking and ethos underlie a lot of the application and interpretation of that framework. You might say that Peterson's whole project here, most of all the bit we skipped over so blithely above, with the biological grounding, is a thoroughly Nietzschean undertaking. Nietzsche rather forcibly pointed out "hey guys, if you don't really believe in God, why are you still doing the stuff he told you to? Maybe we should figure something else out instead." Peterson went "huh, but here we are, more than a century later, still doing that stuff - what's driving that? Even if we don't intellectually believe in God, is there something else going on?" So that's why it's helpful to have Nietzsche in mind, even if most of the book is far more directly influenced by Jung (who was, of course, himself influenced heavily by Nietzsche). To put it briefly, the thesis of the book might be something like "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?"

  <li><a id="orgc9d36a4"></a>A Quick Word about Abstraction<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc9d36a4">
  <p>
  Alright, so here we are for the main event. First, a word about abstraction. This model is an example of an abstraction - you might even argue an abstraction of abstractions. What do I mean by abstraction? Here, at least, I mean a general label you generate to explain what several specific instances have in common. So, you read the Prodigal Son, you hear a few myths about Jupiter, and you watch the Lion King. You notice that the father figures in these stories have some things in common. You also think about all of the actual fathers you have known in your life -  your own, your friends', your own experience with your children, and so forth. You notice that some of the things the story-fathers have in common are also shared, mostly, by these real-life fathers. At this point, you have dozens of specific data points, but if you want, you can take the things that all of them (or at least most of them) have in common and call that the "Father abstraction". No one of these individual fathers will 100% match this abstraction, but all of them will match at least a little, and all of them will match the Father abstraction more closely than, say, the Mother abstraction. So far, so good, right?
  </p>

  <p>
  Well, what if what you're interested in is the difference between widowed fathers, and fathers married to natural mothers, and fathers married to step mothers? Now, the unifying "fatherness" between these three categories is maybe helpful, but much less so, because it hides the very distinction you want to pay attention to. Or, what if you're interested in the story of your own father, the actual, individual human being? All of his nuance and idiosyncracy. Well, now what he has in common with other fathers is almost useless, because you want to know precisely about what is unique to him - even if he still exhibits almost all of the traits of the "Father Abstraction".
  </p>

  <p>
  I bring all this up to make clear something about Peterson's approach. There's a general rule with abstractions - the more widely they can be applied, the less accurately the represent any given instance of the abstraction. Let's think about maps. Imagine you have a military-style grid map that covers an area of roughly 500 square kilometers (10 x 5) with a 10 meter contour interval (there are topographical lines on the map showing changes of elevation of 10 meters). This is a fairly detailed map -  you can successfully use it to find your way through the woods pretty well if the changes in elevation are distinct enough, or with the help of a compass. Now imagine we zoom out to a map that is roughly 5,000 square kilometers and shows changes in elevation at 100 meter intervals. This map covers a wider area, which is certainly useful, but you're going to have a much harder time working out if you're in <i>this</i> tiny draw or <i>that</i> one. The zoomed-out map tells you about more places, but it tells you less about all of those places than a more zoomed-in map would tell you about any one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> tends to work down to some pretty granular "abstractions" - some of the entries may only cover a handful of specific instances, but they analyze what those have in common in a lot of detail. Peterson, on the other hand, zooms way out to try to arrive at the six(ish) archetypes that explain <i>every story ever told</i>. This insight struck me when I was thinking about why I was so irritated by this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve">condescending review of Peterson and specifically Maps of Meaning from Current Affairs</a>. Setting aside the other unfair things this article does, what's relevant to this post is that it makes fun of the diagrams in <i>Maps of Meaning</i> for being so simplistic as to be meaningless. I would argue, instead, they are at the high end of abstraction in order to apply as widely as possible. The good news is that the framework these diagrams represent can be applied to almost any story. The bad news is that without familiarity with a broad set of instances to which that framework applies, it doesn't do much to help you. Imagine that you had never reflected much about the symbolic role of "fathers" in stories or the kinds of roles "fathers" tend to play in real life. Now, imagine someone says to you "okay, so what we're looking at here is clearly an instance of the Father archetype" - if you haven't ever connected the specific instances you've encountered to that abstraction, it's not going to do you much good at all. I think that's part of why <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (and Peterson's lectures) is so sprawling - he sees the abstraction linking many instances, but he realizes that not everyone he's speaking to does, so he's desperately trying to cram a wide survey of specifics into your mind so that the generality abstracted from them will mean something to you.

  <li><a id="org7bfb677"></a>Order, Chaos, and the Mediator<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7bfb677">
  <p>
  Based on the biological grounding that we so blithely skipped over above, Peterson argues that our perception of the world, at a very fundamental level, is sorted into stuff that we treat as pretty much settled (Order), stuff that hasn't been explored and could be anything (Chaos), and how we feel about those things, right now, and in general (the Mediator). Order is symbolically masculine (if your hackles are hackling, see the aside below), Chaos is symbolically feminine, and the Mediator is <i>almost</i> neuter, as what's most important about the Mediator is usually being the <i>child</i> of a symbolically masculine and symbolically feminine force. That being said, our history being what it is, most stories have been about dudes, so the Mediator is usually depicted as a guy, with some flavoring of symbolic masculinity. The other important thing to keep in mind is that both Order and Chaos tend to be "static" until the Mediator interacts with them. Even if there's a lot of "change" within Chaos, it's not <i>significant</i> change - it's "sound and fury, signifying nothing". Think of a pot of water boiling - lots of movement, no real change. Until you put the pasta in!

  <li><a id="orga4d4d0d"></a>A Quick Aside on Gender<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga4d4d0d">
  <p>
  Okay, I know gender is a hot topic these days, so I want to make a few things clear about the very simplified presentation here:
  </p>
  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>The symbolic "masculine" and "feminine" here described are <i>not</i> one-to-one with our biological sex, or even the gender we identify with. Everyone has both masculine and feminine elements within them, and folks like Jung and Peterson argue that to be a fully-developed, healthy person, you need to be comfortable with both, and integrate both wholly into your personality. Whether "masculine" symbolic traits have some fundamental link to male biological sex, and if so, to what degree, is not really important to the functioning of this framework, so if it helps, treat it as wholly arbitrary (see 2 below)</li>
  <li>What characteristics get considered "masculine" or "feminine" in this framework are largely derived from looking at lots and lots of myths and seeing what kind of characters are depicted as male and which as feminine. There are a few challenges here: a. the corpus of myths drawn on is almost entirely from the Mediterranean and Europe, from Ancient Egypt through early modern times, and so the myths of other cultures around the world might consistently assign <i>different</i> traits to masculine or feminine archetypes, b. even within the cultures ancestral to the modern West, what gets considered "masculine" and "feminine" has some variation - for example, the Egyptians had a Father Earth and Mother Sky, and to the Germanic folks, the Sun was a beautiful lady and the Moon a macho man. All of which is to say, we're talking in broad brushstrokes here, but ones that are the most useful for understanding the myths and stories of the Ancient Near East, Mediterranean, and Europe through the Early Modern period.</li>

  <li><a id="org7386c6e"></a>The Good Side and the Bad Side of the Three Basic Categories<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7386c6e">
  <p>
  Each of the three basic categories (Order, Chaos, and Mediator) has a good side and a bad side. These bring us back to our basic motivational systems that we briefly summarized in the Biological Grounding above (you see why he went to the trouble to make sure you believed him on that stuff?) The good side of each symbol represents what about it draws us toward it and rewards us if we do indeed go there - Good Order provides helpful predictability, Good Chaos provides new possibilities, and the Good Mediator allows for these things to be balanced dynamically, adjusted as needed. The bad side, then, reflects what about these categories causes anxiety if you can't get away with it - Bad Order is controlling and stifling, Bad Chaos is wild and unpredictable, the Bad Mediator is too absorbed in him/herself to balance the others and makes things worse. Putting this Good/Bad valence together with the three basic categories gives us six main archetypes, which Peterson argues represent a fairly complete, coherent view of how the world works and how to find meaning within it.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org5240f29"></a>The Good King and the Tyrant - Order, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5240f29">
  <p>
  If you've grown up playing D&amp;D like me, and even more so if you've delved into the Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock fiction that inspired its alignment system, you're likely used to thinking of Order as "basically good". Peterson argues this is only half-right. Civilization and society are heavily associated with Order, especially it's good side. The good side of Order is represented by the Good or Just King. Laws basically uphold what is right, good, competent people usually do better than wicked ones, if you need help, there are folks to turn to who can give it, if you have something you need to do, someone can tell you how to do it.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the other hand, too much Order, or the wrong sort, or even Order that used to be helpful, but now no longer applies, can all become the bad side of Order, the Tyrant. Laws catch you in a tangled web that makes it impossible to do anything without breaking one of them, folks advance more for knowing which boxes to check and what forms to fill out than from competence, if you need help, only properly licensed, authorized, and monitored officials can help you, and if you have something you need to do, you damn well better do it the way everyone else does, or else. If you have ever navigated an automated customer service menu to try to handle a straightforward request, only to have every choice you try take you back to the same (wrong) answer (or even worse, this happened with a live human slavishly following a script), then you know what Bad Order can look like.
  </p>

  <li><a id="orgf9ec81f"></a>The Kind Mother and the Devouring Beast - Chaos, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf9ec81f">
  <p>
  Again, we're facing a bit of bias from the language we use, as we tend to default to "Chaos is bad". The good side of Chaos, the "Kind Mother" archetype, we might instead call "possibility," or "fertility," or even "creativity". The idea is that the only place new things can come from is the unknown, the not-fully-organized, thus, the Chaotic. Good Chaos is also receptive in the good sense - it welcomes you, it responds to your exploration of it, it reveals knowledge and treasures when you ask politely.
  </p>

  <p>
  The bad side of Chaos, the Devouring Beast/Mother, is everything bad about the unknown, the unorganized, the untamed. Beasts in the wilderness, dragons in caves, child-eating witches in gingerbread houses, all of these are manifestations of Bad Chaos. But then, so is the criminal, the outlaw, the raider. Bad Chaos is also receptive in the bad sense - it envelops you, it gives you somewhere to get lost in, it reveals how little you truly know and how insecure your treasures are.
  </p>

  <p>
  Interestingly, the earth (as in, the ground) plays both of these roles. The earth is where the plants we eat grow out of, where the animals we eat roam, and it holds the water we drink. On the other hand, it's also where forests full of lions, tigers, and bears grow, where outlaws and invaders lurk, and where our bones disappear into when we die. The sea can also play both roles (fish come from it, but you can drown in it).

  <li><a id="orgf8f9c26"></a>The Hero and the Villain - The Mediator, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf8f9c26">
  <p>
  Standing between Order and Chaos (whether Good, Bad, or Both) is the individual, the Mediator. This person stands for each of us as we read the story - he makes choices that we can reflect on, undergoes trials that we can sympathize with, and teaches us lessons about achieving goals (or failing to tragically). The Good Mediator is the Hero - an individual who shows wisdom, compassion, generosity, bravery, or any other noble qualities. The Hero recognizes and values the gifts of Good Order and Good Chaos, and bravely confronts the depredations of Bad Order and Bad Chaos. Maybe most importantly, the Hero <i>balances</i> Order and Chaos appropriately - if things have become too rigid, he brings in the rejuvenation of Chaos, if things have become too wild, he brings in the steadying of Order.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Bad Mediator is then, of course, the Villain, the flip side of the same coin. There's a reason for the stereotype of "we're not so different, you and I. . ." - in a good story, the Hero and the Villain <i>do</i> have much in common. Both face an uncertain world full of risks and rewards, both see the interaction of Order and Chaos in their world and try to take some action to put it more to their liking, and both serve to remind us, the reader/listener, <i>what people are like</i>. In many old stories, they are literally brothers. Where the hero displays noble qualities, though, the villain shows some or all of the ignoble: folly, cruelty, selfishness, cowardice, and more. Where the Hero finds balance, the Villain is more likely to tilt things <i>further</i> out of whack, or to swing the pendulum too far the other way. Often, the villain sees only the bad side of one, the other, or both of Order and Chaos. At his worst, the Villain believes that Being itself is wrong and should be undone, the ultimate nihilism.

  <li><a id="org7de6600"></a>A Couple of Examples, to Make this Clear<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7de6600">
  <p>
  Alright, so, like I said, the trouble with abstractions is that if you don't have specific instances to link them to, they can be so vague as to be unhelpful. So let's go through a couple of examples.
  </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgf441a7d"></a>Story/Mythic Example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf441a7d">
  <p>
  One of Peterson's favorite examples, and a film I've come to appreciate more thanks to his exegesis of it, is <i>The Lion King</i>. If you somehow haven't seen it, I suppose I should warn you that here be spoilers. Simba is obviously the Hero, the Good Mediator figure. Mufasa is obviously the Good King/Kind Father, and thus the positive side of Order. Scar kind of plays double duty as the Bad Mediator (Villain), as well as embodying the Tyrant, Bad Order. Nala somewhat takes on the role of Good Chaos by being one hell of a surprise to Simba when she finds him, and starting him on his path back to Pride Rock. And the hyenas are then Bad Chaos (though interestingly, put to work on behalf of Bad Order). The landscape also takes on some of these roles. The Elephant Graveyard, the barren desert that Simba first escapes to, the Pride Lands when they've been screwed up under Scar's rule, all of these are Bad Chaos. The Pride Lands at the beginning and end of the story and the lush paradise Timon and Pumba take Simba to are places of Good Chaos. You can also see how the different archetypes manifest in the same character at different times - young Simba is brave and loyal (Good Mediaor), but full of himself and a bit foolish (Bad Mediator). Teenage Simba is kind and protective of his friends (Good Mediator), but he's deeply afraid and avoids responsibility (Bad Mediator). Adult Simba acknowledges his responsibility and admits what he has done wrong to try to save his people (Good Mediator), but lets himself fall for Scar's manipulations (Bad Mediator). He also shows alternation between how much Chaos and how much Order he represents, and whether it's good or bad. As a rambunctious, rule-breaking child, he embodies Bad(ish) Chaos, but as the one who brings the rains back, Good Chaos. In his desire to boss people around and have his ego flattered ("I Just Can't Wait to Be King!"), he shows Bad Order, but by deposing the Tyrant and restoring just rule to the Pride Lands, he shows Good Order.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, you can see how the application of these archetypes in different ways, and the interplay between them, can lead to a fairly rich and nuanced set of insights into a story.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org77c009a"></a>"Real Life" example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org77c009a">
  <p>
  Okay, stories are well and good, but if you're not yet convinced that understanding stories better will help us understand ourselves and how to live our lives better, then an example of how to apply these archetypes to a story like the one above won't do much for you. So, let me run through how we could use these to think about situations in our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's say you're stuck in a job that makes you miserable. The economy sucks and you're worried about finding another job (Bad Chaos). Your boss is a micromanaging jerk who takes credit for anything good the team does, and passes blame for anything bad (Bad Order). But even worse, the team is a mess - there are no standard procedures to follow, no one knows who is responsible for what, and your boss is constantly dropping surprise last-minute assignments on you (Bad Chaos). You've gotten to the point where you try to avoid as much responsibility as you can and lie about how much work you're doing (Bad Mediator), because trying to do better has just gotten you burned in the past. Your only relief is to spend your weekends either playing video games for hours on end or getting hammered - or both (Bad Mediator).
  </p>

  <p>
  One day, you've had enough, and you decide you're going to put your life back on a track that suits you better (Good Mediator). You realize that one reason you feel stuck is that you don't have the skills you need to get a job somewhere else, so you sign up for a course (Good Mediator). Through the course, you meet some folks who are also looking for work, and you start to hear about opportunities you'd never considered (Good Chaos). You decide that you're going to create a habit of applying to 5 new jobs a week until you find a new one (Good Order). Once you land the new job, you politely, but firmly, tell your boss that you're leaving and it's because this place is terrible (Good Mediator), and you have a very candid exit interview with HR, hoping that maybe the company can be a little better to work for, even if you're gone (Good Order). As you get ready for your first day on the new job, you're a little nervous, but mostly you're excited, because now you know that if it doesn't work out, you can always find something else (Good Chaos).
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, so that wasn't the most detailed or interesting scenario, but hopefully it gives some idea of how these ideas can play out in your life. More importantly, once you've learned to think that way, you can start analyzing situations in your life through this lens - where do you feel stifled (Bad Order)? Where do you feel overwhelmed by uncertainty (Bad Chaos)? Where do you act like a jerk (Bad Mediator)? Where do you help others out (Good Mediator)? Where do you have helpful routines (Good Order)? Where do you feel excited about unexplored possibilities (Good Chaos)?

  <li><a id="org97c67ae"></a>Some Shortcomings of Peterson's Way, as I See Them<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org97c67ae">
  <p>
  Having spent all these words laying out why I think Peterson's framework is helpful, you might (rightly) guess that I'm a big fan. Even still, no framework is foolproof, and this one is no exception. For me, the biggest challenge in using this framework is the level of abstraction discussed above - the fact that it can be applied to <i>any</i> story means that it's missing some of the nuance that it might be helpful to highlight. One example: Jung identified the archetype of the Magician/Wise Old Man, and Campbell noticed how very common that figure was in the "Hero's Journey" mythic storyline. Where does the Magician fit in here? Well, he's kinda-sorta Good Chaos, because he deals with the unknown, but he's also kinda-sorta Good Order, because he often provides wisdom and guidance to the young hero, and he's kinda-sorta the mediator because he helps the hero understand and deal with balancing Order and Chaos. The point is, having a "Magician" archetype you can talk about is often helpful, and it doesn't fit as neatly into the higher-level abstraction of Peterson's framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  Perhaps more fundamentally, let's return to the Nietzschean motivation for this whole project in the first place, which we summarized (and somewhat oversimplified) as "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?" This is making a few pretty big assumptions, though: what about the wide swaths of the world that get by just fine with other bases for their morality? What about folks who still have active, meaningful spiritual experiences and don't feel like (the) God(s) is (are) dead at all? In these cases, I think Peterson's analysis still has much to offer, but his need to ground out this analysis in materialistic explanations compatible with a scientific understanding sometimes bleeds through.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org057e41e"></a>With These Thoughts, Hopefully You Can More Readily Engage with Peterson's Work<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org057e41e">
  <p>
  So, here we are. Peterson's framework is fairly high-level, fairly abstract, but because of this, it's pretty versatile. It's a bit like a Swiss Army Knife of story/myth interpretation - in the long run, you might get far more out of a myth or story through other ways of looking into it deeply, but this gives you a handy starting place, especially for those stories that otherwise seem opaque. Is there a female character? Maybe she represent Chaos, Good, Bad, or mixed. Can the main character's actions be interpreted as balancing Order and Chaos? What about representatives of Order - are they acting more just and protecting, or more tyrannical and controlling? I like to think of this method as a kind of prybar for getting into the underlying meaning of a story - it might not help you fully unpack it, but it can almost always help you get started.

  <p>
  So, I'm getting close on my "Hail Idun", but I can tell I'm not <i>right</i> there yet.
  Divination has suggested that I ought to go with a single stanza of Galdralag
  (two four-line half stanzas), and a few of the images/themes I should/shouldn't
  include. These poems/prayers are highly personal, but I'm also trying to make
  sure they work for other folks, so I'm going to share three variants I'm
  thinking over below, and I'd very much welcome your thoughts on what bits work,
  what don't, and what I might change. As I've said before, whatever I land on for
  this prayer will be the beating heart of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, so I want to get it
  right.

  Again, it would be a great help if you can share your thoughts on any of the above, most of all if the wording of any bits works better than others - whether to pick one or another, whether to blend them together, or whether to start all over again. Thanks very much, and I hope you find something helpful here.

  </p>

  <p>
  This is very much a "start writing to work things out and see where takes you"
  kind of post, or even more so, series of posts, I'm sure. The more I think about
  and reflect on the role of aesthetic taste in questions of meaning, metaphysics,
  and even ethics, the more weighty it seems to be. I know that it's far from an
  original thought to be like "whoah, maybe beauty is a transcendental virtue" (as
  in, "Plato talked about this, and it wasn't new then" unoriginal). Even still,
  it's a line of thinking I'm trying to work out for myself, and I think maybe
  talking it over with you will help with that. Hopefully you'll at least bear
  with me, and with any luck, I'll share something you find helpful.
  </p>

  <p>
  In my head, this feels like a coherent, even simple idea, but whenever I find
  myself trying to explain it, I see that it is actually huge, messy, and touches
  nearly everything else. I had been thinking I should read more about this and
  wait to write about it until I had digested more folks' thoughts, but one of the
  things I'm trying to make myself do with these weekly blog posts is to do more
  of my thinking "out loud", both since it lets me get more feedback from others,
  but also since it makes me get it down in some more-or-less definite form, which
  often makes it clear where my thinking is fuzzy, derivative, or otherwise not
  what I'd like it to be. So, here's my attempt at a short version: our sense of
  what is aesthetic, what is beautiful, what is pleasing is <i>central</i> to our ability
  to sort out what is best and most meaningful in life. It's not the <i>only</i> thing
  around that, but it's one of the very weighty things.
  </p>

  <p>
  What do I mean by this, exactly? If you have a philosophy that makes good sense
  to you and you can back up logically, but it leaves you cold, it's almost
  certainly <i>not</i> your path to a truly meaningful and good life. Likewise, if there
  is something that stirs you deeply, but you can't truly say why, you likely
  ought to follow it. I suspect, but don't yet have any way to make my case, that
  our sense of what "looks right" or "feels right" or "is beautiful" is a very
  deep synthesis of many factors, including some that are very important, but very
  hard to access consciously. An analogy I can draw on from experience: if you've
  ever learned to draw human bodies, then there are certain proportions in a
  drawing that you will just expect to see, and if you don't, you'll be like
  "something is wrong with this drawing, I don't like it". On the other hand,
  there are certain ways real human proportions can be exaggerated or manipulated
  for pleasing artistic effect (think the giant eyes that anime borrowed from
  Disney cartoons). With enough muscle memory of drawing correctly proportioned
  anatomy, getting the proportions wrong just "feels" off, even if you can't say
  exactly why. Now, you might argue that such drawing doesn't carry much moral or
  spiritual weight, and you're likely right, but it's a very clear cut example of
  somewhere that a lot of internalized knowledge due to practice, observation, and
  feedback leads to a situation where that internalized knowledge is perceived as
  "it just doesn't feel right". I suspect that most aesthetic perception of the
  sort "I dunno, I just like it" or "that just sounds off to me" is, in fact, the
  same kind of deeply internalized knowledge from repeated exposure and judgment.
  </p>

  <p>
  One nice thing about this way of thinking about aesthetics is that it helps us
  get around the always-present and always-thorny problem of "what about sexual
  attraction, though?" If you haven't run into this, here's how it goes: "The idea
  of 'beauty' is clearly somehow related to the concept of sexual attraction, but
  there are beautiful things that have nothing to do with sex, so what gives?"
  This is an especially telling point if your primary basis for understanding
  aesthetics, or even all of human psychology, is an evolutionary one, where sex
  gets the starring role. So how does my proposal above address this? Well, if we
  take "aesthetic judgment" to mean something like "the qualitative feeling that
  something you observe is suitable or not suitable to the purpose for which
  you're evaluating it, whether or not you can articulate the drivers for that
  judgment," then all of a sudden the link between sexual attraction and aesthetic
  beauty becomes easy to define. If a judgment of something as aesthetically
  "beautiful" is the positive feeling you get for something that you're pretty
  sure will "work", even if you don't know why, then seeing someone that will
  "work" for you sexually, even if you can't articulate why, will present in a
  very similar way. Add in the fact that the sex drive is super important to most
  folks, and this becomes an area of aesthetic judgment that almost everyone
  exercises every day, all the time. So, by this logic, it's not that aesthetic
  beauty is some ramification or epiphenomenon of sexual attraction, it's that
  your judgment of sexual attractiveness is just your best exercised aesthetic
  muscle (if you're anything like most folks).
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, my thoughts could go a lot of different directions from here, but that
  actually got me to a new conclusion (I hadn't worked out that judgment of sexual
  attractiveness is a <i>subset</i> of aesthetic judgment, rather than something
  foundational or ancestral to it). So, I think I'll wrap things up for now. Some
  directions I'd like to go here: what to make of evil aesthetic judgments (it is
  <i>pleasing</i> to torture this person)? Can you arrive at ethically defensible
  positions without bringing in aesthetics? Can aesthetics lead you astray? What
  role have aesthetic judgments played in my own spiritual growth? All these and
  more lead me to want to write many more posts, but I have no idea when they'll
  come out.

  </p>

  <p>
  Today is my birthday, so I'm going to go ahead and take one of my "steadholders"
  for the year. I had hoped to get a new take on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_hail_idun_prayer">Hail Idun</a> prayer in
  Germanish meter, but my first few drafts aren't doing it for me, and since
  it will be the beating heart of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I want to get it right.
  Instead, a few things I've been thinking about:
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>38 truly feels a lot closer to 40 than 37, but even that was "not my
  'mid-thirties' anymore." I've always sought to not get too hung up on youth
  and my age, and to know and accept my own looming death, but it didn't fully
  hit me until 2018 when my mother passed away and my first daughter was born
  within a couple of months of each other. That was one hell of a shot of
  "you're only one step in the ongoing march of life" all at once.</li>
  <li>My older daughter is doing her bit to make me feel the full weight of
  growing older. Yesterday, she asked me "Daddy, are you an old man?" and I
  said "no, not yet, but I'm on my way there." So, she said "will you be an
  old man tomorrow?" and again "no, not just yet." "Well, when will you be an
  old man?" "Not for a while, honey."</li>
  <li>More earnestly, my deepening spiritual work has been a big help with
  acknowledging and dealing with my feelings about getting older. I truly
  don't know where I'd be had the last few years gone otherwise. These days,
  my only regret is that I didn't find this path sooner, but I keep telling
  myself it's not a race, there's no prize for "doing more," it's not about
  what's at the end of the path, it's all about walking it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  With that said, I put forth my blessings to you and hope the coming year treats
  you wonderfully.
  </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2023-February-05
  </p>

  <p>
  The very first book that I dug into after my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year with dead writers</a> was <i>The
  Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine Feminine Hidden in the Rosary</i> by
  Clark Strand and Perdita Finn. Someone had spoken well of it on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/183049.html?thread=29927177#cmt29927177">Magic Monday</a>
  over on JMG's dreamwidth journal, and it sounded like it would be
  helpful to me in my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> work. Overall, I found the book helpful and
  thought-stirring, but below, I share my thoughts in more depth.
  </p>

  <p>
  In a nutshell, the book makes the case that the Rosary is a very helpful tool
  for spiritual growth and healing that need not be only for Catholics, or even
  Christians. The book is written with one chapter for every bead on a stock
  Rosary, and the chapters are grouped by the old mysteries (so no "Luminous
  mysteries"). Through these chapters, the writers put forth that the Rosary
  represents a very, very old strand of Goddess worship squelched by the church
  that nevertheless found its way into folks' daily practice. They give some
  slightly changed ways of saying the prayers to make them a bit more welcoming
  for those who are not Christians. They also give some thoughts on how to pray,
  such as getting together in "Rosary Groups". The bulk of the book speaks of the
  writers' own spiritual paths with the Rosary: coming to it through
  "coincidences" and visions, deepening connection with it, and some "whoah, this
  [stuff] works" moments. Along the way, they talk about how the Rosary came to be
  and what has happened with it, of the Church, of religion more broadly, and
  their own backgrounds in spiritual seeking. If any of this sounds like it might
  be interesting, read on!
  </p>

  <p>
  I said at the start that my goal in reading this book was to deepen my
  understanding of the Rosary as a step on the way to crafting my "Heathen
  Rosary", and weirdly enough, this book might as well have been written for that
  very end. Okay, okay, not <i>wholly</i> that, but their way of talking about the Rosary
  was remarkably helpful to me in a few ways. First, the weight they put on the
  Rosary as a way of getting a hold of the "Divine Feminine", but matched with
  calls to the "Divine Masculine", lined up with one of my gut-feelings about what
  makes the Rosary work so well. Next, my way of working has been to "back-craft"
  the Rosary, to work on understanding what makes it tick beyond "it's
  contemplation while saying the same prayers over and over with beads to keep
  track". As such, their use of a <i>almost</i> the stock Rosary, but with a <i>very</i> unalike
  theological understanding and goal, meant that a lot of their insights were
  worthwhile to me. Lastly, the book highlights the slow, steady insight and
  wisdom that comes from ongoing work, even if you don't know why/how/whether it's
  working, which matches how spiritual practice has worked out for me so far.
  </p>

  <p>
  To take these as they were named, the first thing was weighty enough to show up in the
  under-name (subtitle) of the book: the Rosary is a way of getting in
  touch with the "Divine Feminine." While this was one of the main
  ways the book was helpful to me, it also touches on one of the book's biggest drawbacks for me, which is that the writers seem to believe something like "all Goddesses are one Goddess". As such, they see worship of
  mother Goddesses in the paleolithic caves of France, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and
  praying the Rosary all as unalike ways of giving prayer and worship to the same holy Being. This
  is what is sometimes called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LSd3iLCUtU">soft polytheism</a>, which I think is
  likely an overly shallow take on what's going on in the spiritual world. This hurdle is fairly readily dealt with, but
  it's also there throughout the whole book.  Even so,
  I think they rightly mark out some threads of what worship for feminine
  beings is like and bring those threads out clearly in the Rosary and what it has
  to teach. What kind of things do I mean? Things like kindness, forgiveness, open-heartedness, and
  wisdom. The book doesn't highlight as much the matching (not to say equal weight)
  between the masculine and feminine held in the Rosary. Each decade of ten "Hail Marys" opens
  with an "Our Father" and closes with a "Glory Be" (which calls upon the Father,
  the Son, and the Holy Ghost) - so you can see that Mary (the feminine) is very
  much at the heart of the practice, but with a weighty masculine match. I
  think it likely that this is a weighty bit of what makes the Rosary so mighty
  spiritually, and I want to have the same overall take for my Heathen Rosary.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, this book is indeed helpful for my "back-crafting" work, since it takes the Rosary earnestly, but is not bound by Catholic theology or
  doctrine. This opens the writers up to insights about how it works and what it's
  doing that a Catholic might either not heed or else make match up with the overall shape of their
  set of beliefs. For one ready showdeal, the set of prayers for the Rosary given in the book
  leaves out the Apostle's Creed at the beginning, because that is a downright
  affirmation that "yes, I believe the things Christianity has to teach" and puts
  the whole prayer in that framework. A Catholic likely deems that a needful
  bit, where Strand and Finn see it as a "lock" put on the gate to keep
  out those the Church wouldn't want saying "its" prayer. Likewise, in talking through the
  mysteries to be contemplated while praying the Rosary, a Catholic like de
  Montford will strongly ground them in the wider framework of Catholic theology, with
  a lot of steering on what a right understanding of each mystery might be.
  This work, on the other hand, looks at the mysteries as one set of tales showing
  wider spiritual truths. You don't have to believe that 2,000 years ago a Rabbi's
  dead body woke up and walked out of a cave to find loveliness, meaning, and Truth of
  a less straightforward kind in the tale of the rebirth. I'm most of all thankful
  that the writers spelled out how both the mysteries and the words of the "Hail Mary" go from life to suffering to death
  to rebirth. I may not want my Heathen Rosary to go through the same steps, but I
  do want the same kind of deep, framing resonances between the
  prayers themselves and the overall practice. To bring in an
  overly-leaned-upon forlikening (metaphor): this book has worked like a Rosetta Stone for the Rosary for
  me - rather than needing to translate from Catholic to Heathen with nothing in
  between, I can see what translating the Rosary into other spiritual "tongues"
  looks like, which is helpful.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thirdly, the book spoke to a way of coming at spiritual growth that I seem to need to work on -
  steadfast, bit-by-bit unfolding of wisdom and insight through ongoing work. To
  fully share what I mean, I might have to lay out a bit about myself. Growing
  up, I was always a "smart kid" - I understood things quickly, soaked up new
  knowledge, and otherwise was ready to do things with my mind. I say
  this not to brag, as you'll see, but to highlight that I was (and largely still
  am) "brainy", maybe to the harm of other ways of knowing and understanding
  the world. This was made painfully clear to me in the aftermath of my mother
  passing away from cancer.  Mind-wise, I had settled myself with what had
  happened, what it meant to me, how I should think and feel about it, and I
  thought I was alright. But I was not alright. My wife at last got me to go talk to a
  therapist, and through that and some of my own looking back, I had the insight
  that I was so wont to being able to think my way through things, to use my mind
  to handle stuff in my life, that I thought my feelings would play by the same
  rules, to answer to the same ways of doing things. In the same way that as a kid in math class, after doing a few problems I "got" how to bring to bear the principle
  and found further going over boring and unneeded, I thought that reading a few
  books, thinking about what happened in a few other folks' lives  meant that I "got" grief
  and could go about my business with that little hardship cleanly worked out. As will
  no doubt be blindingly clear to you, unless you share the same quirk of which
  I've been telling, this is not at all how grief or any other weighty feeling
  works. You have to, you know, truly <i>feel</i> it, and that takes time and cannot
  be bossed around by the words in your head. What does work is daily, plodding
  work, over and over again, whether you're "feeling it" this time or not. Whether
  prayer, meditation, journaling, or whatever other spiritual practice, every time
  I have buckled down and done it no matter what, <i>that</i> is where I have been gifted
  with worthwhile spiritual experiences. The book had a lovely quote on coming at
  the Rosary in this way:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Rosary wisdom tends to grow slowly, building gradually over the course of a
  lifetime. The rosary isn't a degree program. There are no classes or courses.
  There's no diploma at the end. There isn't any end. We never stop accumulating
  the wisdom of the rosary. The beads turn, the seasons pass. The experiences of a
  lifetime settle within us like fallen leaves and flowers, becoming the top-soil
  that nourishes and informs our lives.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Overall, I found this book insightful and helpful, and I'm very glad I read it.
  That being said, it won't grab everyone alike. For starters, if the Rosary holds
  no spiritual or aesthetic appeal for you, I doubt that this book will change
  that. For another, Strand and Clark are coming at this from an openly "feminist"
  outlook, which brings along with it ways of framing and understanding things
  that you may or may not find helpful. One showdeal is their strong dislike and
  wariness of hierarchy, most of all those mostly made up of men, as seen when
  they speak rather harshly of "religion" many times in the book. By "religion"
  they seem to mean any group with any hierarchy given to spiritual ends. Another
  showdeal is that in a few steads they treat masculine ways of understanding or
  dealing with the world as childish or mistaken, things that need to be outgrown
  or put aside, rather than matched with feminine ways for a healthy whole. For
  both of these showdeals, they share things they have lived through that make it
  rather understandable how they would come to this way of looking at the world,
  including some truly wretched dealings with so-called spiritual teachers, but I
  still think they've "learned too much" from those happenings. Lastly, they speak
  in rather apocalyptic words about the way the world is going - it's not so much
  that I doubt things things are going to go poorly, but rather that I don't
  foresee the sudden and utter outcomes held in apocalyptic thinking about what
  may come. I think a slow, ragged <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-long-descent-a-user-s-guide-to-the-end-of-the-industrial-age-john-michael-greer/15681939?ean=9781945810282">descent</a> is a far more likely forecast.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, if you'd like to learn more about the Rosary from a truly not-Christian
  way of looking at the world, or maybe work at understanding some of what folks have
  found in praying the Rosary, this book's a great way to do that.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2023-January-29
  </p>

  <p>
  In my ongoing work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I hit upon the thought that I ought to have something much like the Christian "Sign of the Cross" - a quick prayer and bodily token of self-blessing and warding. As with much of this undertaking, I started from the thought that Christian, most of all older kinds of Christian, tradition has much that works well, and maybe it doesn't <i>only</i> work for Christian beliefs. The things that drew me to the Sign of the Cross were 1. it is rather short, 2. in that short length, it calls upon a whole, balanced holiness, and 3. it is linked with energy centers in the subtle body. These hallmarks let the Sign of the Cross be something that Christians use both day-to-day (before and after longer prayers, when coming to the altar, and so forth) and also "as needed", such as coming across something dreadful or grasping that a statement ought to have been a prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, I set about coming up with such a short prayer-with-gesture that works for my own beliefs and worship. What I came up with largely came from intuition, meditation, prayer, and divination. I haven't tested it out much yet, so if anyone else finds this helpful, I'd love to hear from you. Let me break down how I matched up the bits I laid out above:
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>To make it short, I settled on <i>Galdralag</i> <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">meter</a>. I also tried out some others, such as four lines of <i>Anglo-Saxon Long Lines</i>, but those felt a bit long for what I was looking for.</li>
  <li>To get a whole, balanced likeness of the spiritual world, I began with the thought of the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. As I worked on this and meditated, though, it came to me to instead focus mainly on the three wells from which the World Tree's roots drink - in Old Norse, <i>Hvergelmir</i>, <i>Mimisbrunnr</i>, and <i>Urdabrunnr</i> (more on these below when I talk about the words I picked).</li>
  <li>For the energy centers, I drew on those marked out in John Michael Greer's Druidic magical systems, such as that laid out in his <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>. These are the "womb center" about an inch below the belly button, the "third eye" between the eyebrows, and the heart center (unsurprisingly, at the heart).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  Again, I got to much of this in a way I can't wholly spell out in a way I can back up, but it feels pretty strong to me nonetheless.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, what of the prayer itself? As I said, I used <i>Galdralag</i>, and here's what I came up with:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  From seething hwer<sup>1</sup>,//
  Woden's drink,//
  and Wyrd's holy well,//
  Mighty tree unmatched.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  <i>1 An Old English word meaning "boiler, cauldron"</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  A few thoughts on the words I picked. First, "hwer" was a bit of an odd one, but I couldn't land on a translation of <i>Hvergelmir</i> I liked much. <i>Hwer</i> is the direct cognate with Old Norse <i>hver</i>, a word for a pot or a kettle. The <i>gelmir</i> bit is cognate with "yelling", but "Yelling Pot" just doesn't have much of a ring to it in English, to say nothing of making the alliteration work. The sense of <i>Hvergelmir</i> seems to be something like churning rapids, or a steaming, boiling hot spring. "Woden's Drink" is a pretty straightforward kenning for Meomer's (<i>Mimir's</i>) Well, the well of wisdom that Woden gave his eye to drink from. Wyrd's holy well is, of course, the Old Norse <i>Urdhabrunnr</i>, Wyrd being a direct cognate for <i>Urdh</i>. The "mighty tree unmatched" is, also of course, the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, here's how I've been doing it:
  </p>
  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>Take 2 fingers and put them about an inch below your belly button and say "From seething hwer,"</li>
  <li>Move your fingers to the spot between your eyebrows and say "Woden's drink,"</li>
  <li>Move your fingers to your heart and say "and Wyrd's holy well, Mighty tree unmatched."</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  This ought to work for Heathen's who'd like an all-around self-blessing/warding to say before and/or after prayer, when running into wicked things, and so forth. I'll start using it, and I'll let you know what I find out.
  </p>

  <p>
  I very much like when a writer shares not only the books that they read, but also what they think of them - an "annotated bibliography". I may not have a book of my own (yet), but I do have a big ol' list of books I have read or want to read on Germanish belief, and I thought I'd share it. As I get to the books I haven't read on this list, I might come back and add my thoughts on them. If you know of any books you think ought to be on the list, kindly let me know! For now, I'll share my thoughts either from reading the book, or what I know about it that makes me want to read it.
  </p>

  <p>
  Also, it ought to go without saying, but given the times we live in, I'll say it anyhow: my putting a book on the list below does not mean I agree with it in whole or in part - it only means that I think it might have some insights on understanding the field it's about. 
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org999e495"></a>Wellsprings of the Lore<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org999e495">
  <p>
  These are the elder works that everything else builds upon. Mostly written down by Christians, and mostly written sometime after folks worshiped the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, we are nevertheless lucky to have far more to work with than the beliefs of many other lands. These works show us a tantalizing glimpse of the wider world of Gods, Goddesses, elves, dwarves, and other wights that the folks of Germanish lands lived in before the coming of Christianity.

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org9cf9a66"></a>The Prose Edda<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9cf9a66">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Snorri Sturlusson <br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes, more than once, from many translators<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is <i>the</i> book to read on Old Norse mythology. If you read nothing else, read this one. Helpfully put-together and makes good sense, maybe <i>too</i> much sometimes, but most of the "summaries of Old Norse Mythology" below are mostly restatements of this. More than one good translation out there, but I like the Jesse Byock one or Jackson Crawford's.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org28f73c1"></a>The Poetic Edda<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org28f73c1">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Many writers<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: In many ways, this is even more grounded than <i>The Prose Edda</i>, but it's harder to follow if you haven't already read Sturlusson's learned summary. Jackson Crawford's translation is helpfully literal, Lee Hollander's has a delightful Germanish taste thanks to the words he uses, and Maria Kvilhaug's take in her book <i>Seed of Yggdrasil</i> (see below) gives the meaning of the proper names, which is a big help to understanding.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org62573a4"></a>The Sagas of the Icelanders<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org62573a4">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Many writers<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some of it<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: I have a lovely collection of <i>all</i> of the sagas in translation, available <a href="https://sagas.is/yfirlit.htm">here</a>. These works give a lot of hints about what pre-Christian belief and worship looked like, but it takes some amount of combing to make the most of them.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga7007d7"></a>Germania<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga7007d7">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Tacitus<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is maybe our oldest written take on what the Germanish folks of the time believed and did for worship. It has the great strength of <i>not</i> being written by Christians, which gives a very different look at things.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgb2d6dfd"></a>Gesta Danorum<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb2d6dfd">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Saxo Grammaticus <br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This re-tells many of the stories found in the <i>Prose Edda</i> and tells a few others not known elsewhere, but through the "euhemerization" lens. Basically, Saxo believes that the Heathen lore was a garbled way of talking about normal humans that lived in the world. So, he needs to be taken with lots of salt, but he shares a lot that can't be found elsewhere.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf24660a"></a>Heimskringla<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf24660a">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Snorri Sturlusson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No]]
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is a history of the kings of Norway and Sweden written by the same heavy hitter who gave us the <i>Prose Edda</i>. Though written as a "history," the older bits likely draw on beliefs from before Christianity. For translations, Lee Hollander's is good, but there are very many.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgde7fcb7"></a>Beowulf<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgde7fcb7">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Unknown, translated by Howell D. Chickering<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: The one, best-known poem from Old English times, it was written down by a Christian monk, but it holds many beliefs from older times. This translation comes in  dual-language edition that shows the Old English text, and on the facing page.

  <li><a id="orgf1522db"></a>Grove and Gallows: Greek and Latin Sources for Germanic Heathenism<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf1522db">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: James Chisholm<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is the very kind of workhorse book that everyone else is lucky to have when someone goes to the trouble to put it together. It brings together short outcuttings (excerpts) from Classical and Medieval Christian sources on Germanish Heathens (so, pretty much everything other than the Germanish Poetry that we have about the Heathenry of elder times). My one gripe is that it doesn't give the Latin or Greek, only the words wended (translated) into English.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org0f607ca"></a>The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0f607ca">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Unknown, translated by J.R.R. Tolkien<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Not <i>only</i> a translation, this tells a coherent version of the story of Sigurd and Gudrun, which are told in multiple places in multiple languages. Tolkien put it together following the rules of Old Norse/Old English poetic meter in modern English, which makes for a lovely read. Mark that it's a bit of a stretch to call this a "wellspring", since Tolkien did much to work together bits that didn't readily fit together, and the words are his own poetry.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgd2c5543"></a>Other Old English Works<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd2c5543">
  <p>
  There's a fairly large body of work in Old English, much of it poetry, but all written down by Christians. Even so, there are hints and clues to older belief salted throughout, and if nothing else, you can get an understanding of the folkways that kept going after switching over to Christianity that might help us understand what folks were like before Christianity..
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org9771540"></a>The Complete Old English Poems<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9771540">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Many Writers, Translated by Craig Williamson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Lots of stuff to work with, but it is a <i>big</i> body of lore, which may not be of as much help as things like the <i>Prose Edda</i>, as much of it is very Christian. Still, the good news is there is a lot of it, and that means lots of small hints and glimpses scattered throughout.

  <li><a id="orge499228"></a>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge499228">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Many Writers, Translated by Michael Swanton]]
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Written down to keep track of what happened during which King's rule, this is another thing written down by Christians, but with bits to help out those who want to know more about beliefs before the Christians.

  <li><a id="org0d5eef9"></a>Learned Works (Academic Works)<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d5eef9">
  <p>
  These books are written by men and women building upon earlier writings by the learned and working hard to back up what they say with evidence. Most of the books below sit right on the line between those written for other learned men and women and those written for everyday folks.
  </p>

  <p>
  This may well end up the longest bit of this list, so I've broken it up by fields. Many of these books could rightly be put in more than one of these fields, but I've put them where they seem most fitting to me.

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d78170">
  <p>
  These works are all about the Gods, Goddesses, other Beings without bodies, and their worship and lore. These works take the wellsprings above and try to put them together with things dug up from the past, looking at the ways of worship of other Indo-European folks, and so forth.

  <li><a id="orgfe5df34"></a>Myths of the Pagan North<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgfe5df34">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Christopher Abram<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: One of the many overviews of Old Norse lore. I have to confess that I have many of these, but have not much read them, as I feel like I already know most of what they hold. That being said, besides their main use (helping folks new to the lore get to know it), they are also helpful to more knowledgeable folks since they bring together in one stead what we know of the tales, beliefs, and worship about each God, the evidence for which might be spread across many works of elder times.

  <li><a id="orge42ebb4"></a>The Poetic Edda (Commentary)<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge42ebb4">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Paul Acker and Carolyne Larrington<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: A gathering of the thoughts of learned folks on the poems of the <i>Poetic Edda</i>. I haven't dug in yet, but an Ecosophia reader spoke well of it. I gather that Larrington brings an at least somewhat "feminist" lens to looking at Germanish lore, which is rather unlike most of the other folks I read, and so ought to give some new ways of understanding things.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd4ae209">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Paul Bauschatz<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: I'm reading this at the time of putting this list together, and I'm finding it rather interesting. It seems that Bauschatz mostly uses linguistic evidence to argue that the speakers of Germanish tongues thought about time in a rather unalike way to how we do now or how Roman and Christian writers did, and that we misunderstand what myths meant when we put today's way of looking at time on to them. <i>Very</i> hard to find, but try your nearest university bookhoard.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgef96a66">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Brian Branston<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Unlike many of the books on this list, this one looks more to old <i>things</i> rather than old <i>words</i> - it goes over the archaeological evidence for the Gods of pre-Christian England. Some online reviews say that Branston is overly ready to see what he wants to see, but even if so, I would often rather have a writer willing to do that than one who is <i>so</i> careful with finding meaning that you are left with nothing useful for someone seeking to shape their own worship.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Hilda R. Ellis Davidson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Once again, an overview, but this one by a writer who is one of the best known in the field. Davidson was one of the first folks coming from the field of speechlore (philology) to look also at what can be known from digging up old things (archaeology).

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org31e6b03">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Hilda R. Ellis Davidson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: While <i>Gods and Myths</i> is more about the tales of the Gods, this book seems to look more at what we know about how they were worshipped.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4ad4bc4">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Hilda R. Ellis Davidson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: I am very much looking forward to reading this one, as it looks at both Germanish and Celtic lore and talks through some of the likenesses between them and how those might have come about. This one hits right in the middle of the Venn diagram overlap of my interest in Germanish Lore and my work with Celtic lore through Revival Druidry.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Hilda R. Ellis Davidson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Maybe the most thoroughgoing breakdown of what the Germanish folks of elder times seemed to have believed about death, dying, and the afterlife. Pretty much every book below written by today's believers for worship draws heavily on this.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgfc6ec84">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Michael J. Enright<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: I started reading this and had to put it down for my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year reading only books by the dead</a>, but I think it will be very worthwhile to get back to. Enright lays out the evidence that Celtic and Germanish warbands of the <i>volkerwanderung</i> times had a role for a woman as seeress and initiator, and that you can see hints of this throughout the later lore, even as late as Beowulf. This seems rather weighty for understanding Germanish Goddesses, maybe Freyja most of all.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Thor Ewing<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: It's been a while since I read this, but I remember finding it very interesting. The name is maybe overly-broad for what the book is truly about, which is making the case that berserkers and valkyries were real-life groups of worshippers of Odin. I remember thinking that maybe it went a bit too far into "explaining" mythical elements as real-life things done by worshippers, but I think the book is largely right.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org222a387">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Marie-Louise von Franz<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: A student of Carl Jung's, von Franz wrote rather a lot books. I've pulled out the two that I am most looking forward to reading and that seem to have the most bearing on Germanish belief. This one gives an overall take on understanding fairy tales as expressions of Jung's archetypes, which I have found a very helpful way of getting more meaning out of such tales.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Marie-Louise von Franz<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Much like the above, but focused on the "Shadow" archetype, and how that shows itself in evil beings in fairy tales.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Bill Griffiths<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This seems to be a gathering of the evidence for how the Anglo-Saxons did magic - written charms, things dug up, bits of folk belief that seem to have old roots, and so forth.

  <li><a id="orgc83680d"></a>Teutonic Mythology<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc83680d">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Jacob Grimm (translator Jason Stallybrass)<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: You can say with much fairness that this monster work is the granddaddy of the whole field. Most folks only know about Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm for the fairy tales they gathered, and don't know that they were mostly gathering those tales to find hints about the Gods, lore, and beliefs of elder Germanish folks. While some of what Grimm puts forward has been deemed wrong by later writers, much of it holds up, and if nothing else, his writing is a nearly unbelievable <i>wealth</i> of clues to Germanish folkways, beliefs, lore, and worship beyond the obvious ones from the <i>Eddas</i> and <i>Sagas</i>.

  <b>By</b>: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Though having less bearing on the beliefs and worship of the Germanish folks of elder times than Jacob's great work, there are nonetheless lots of clues scattered throughout. Also, these tales are fun to read!

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb86083a">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Vilhelm Gronbech<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Many of the works for today's worshipers below mark out this book as somewhere to learn much about how the Germanish folks of elder times thought about the world. From what I've read, it seems that it is very much an outgrowth of its time, and holds a lot of the ways of thinking of the late 19th and early 20th century. All that being said, it seems to be a thoroughgoing take on getting at the thoughtworld of pre-Christian Germanish folks, rather than only understanding their tales or folkways.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4637261">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Kathleen Herbert<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Herbert has written tales about heroes from English lore, told again in a way that is meant to draw on what we know about Elder times and that makes sense and reads well to today's readers, rather than the often patchy bits of poetry or mentions in the Chronicle or the like.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Della Hooke<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This seems to be what it says on the tin: a thoroughgoing look at how trees were written about, crafted, and so forth amongst the Anglo-Saxons. I don't think it homes in on worship or belief most of all, but trees were very weighty in Anglo-Saxon belief, even in Christian times (see "The Dream of the Rood" for a showdeal, which is a poem about the crucifixion the way the tree that became the cross saw it).

  <b>By</b>: Kris Kershaw<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is maybe <i>the</i> most insightful book on Odin and where his historical worship came from and how it changed. I haven't read widely enough to know how much weight to give to those who set aside Kershaw's claims, but much was  made clear to me through reading this, and I still need to meditate on it more.

  <b>By</b>: Claude Lecouteux<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Lecouteux is a French thinker who has pulled together much work on "folklore" rather than on the writings of elder times above, which makes him a helpful complement. Many of his books have only been translated into English in the last ten years or so, so I think he hasn't hit the English-speaking world as hard as the amount and worth of his work maybe should. I'm still only dipping my toes into his stuff, but it is wonderful to find someone talking about things I want to learn about, but coming at it from a wholly different grounding than what I already know.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Much of it<br />

  <b>By</b>: Claude Lecouteux<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Another book that I started in on and then had to set aside for my year of reading only books by dead writers. Even though the name of this book has the ugly "dwarfs" instead of the lovely and rightful "dwarves", I am very much looking forward to digging back into this book. It seems to shed a lot of light on why it is that elves and dwarves have something to do with barrows and forebearers, which is something I look forward to working out my own take on.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: Still another "overview" book, I don't know much about Lindow, but his research seems to include the beliefs and worship of the folks around the Germanish, such as the Sami and Inuit, which might give him some insight into things that shaped their belief outside of the Proto-Indo-European wellspring.

  <b>By</b>: Richard North<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This work goes through where the pre-Christian Gods are named in the Old English writings, and seems to make the case that Ing (likely the same as <i>Ingvi-Freyr</i>) held a very high standing in the beliefs and worship of the Anglo-Saxons. Some folks seem to think he might read too much into what is there, but as I said above, I'd rather have folks speculating wildly than not sharing insights that might turn out worthwhile.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: It sounds like this is a pretty thorough look at the wide field of evidence for what the Anglo-Saxons believed and how they worshipped. Unlike many books in this field, it also seems this one doesn't hold itself only to Germanish many-godded (polytheist) worship, but also looks at Roman and Celtic many-godded worship and Christianity.

  <b>By</b>: Stephen Pollington<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Much of it<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Pollington has become one of my best-loved writers on all things Anglo-Saxon. His work is thorough, with wide-faring citations and careful bringing together of widespread threads. He also strikes a balance between sharing what implications a bit of evidence might have, while being careful to call out what is well-grounded and what is more out-there. This book does a wonderful job of finding the links between the Old English evidence (often scant) and the Nordic lore that is so much more thorough. If your interest in Germanish lore, belief, or worship is at all Anglo-Saxon flavored, this book is well worth your time.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: All of the good things I say about <i>The Elder Gods</i> hold true here as well, but this time in a book about the healing ways of the Anglo-Saxons, which were made up of wortlore (herbalism), eating right, charms, prayer, and other fields.

As his journal name might make you think, Polome's strength is bringing insights from comparative Indo-European work to bear on Germanish belief, to help fill in gaps and unriddle things that make us scratch our heads in the lore.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Another gathering of fairy tales, this was put together by another German at the same time as the Grimms were doing their work - they all knew each other - but Schonwerth's work ended up in a small town's bookhoard until the early 21st century, when it was translated and published. I find it most helpful for giving me another way of looking at the better known fairy tales, as many of the tales in this work are <i>almost</i> familiar, but unalike enough to strike you as weird.

  This bit could likely be built out far more, most of all if I ever settle on taking on Old Norse or today's German. For now, this is weighted toward my liking of Old English. Mark also that this bit hold works on Runes as a way of writing rather than as a tool for magic. It's helpful to know that many "serious" folks whose field of learning is the Runes lean toward putting very little weight on their use for magic at all, ever, since they do not wish to be overly linked with folks today who seek to use the runes for magic. Make of that what you will.

  <p>
  While not straightforwardly about Germanish belief, these works look into what we might know or guess about the forebearers that Germanish folks shared with other folks of Eurasia. These can be a wellspring of surprising insights, but should also be taken with the right amount of salt, for almost the whole field comes from folks going "this thing calls this other thing to mind", whether that be words that sound alike, tales that go along the same lines, or Gods that took similar worship. Professional men and women of learning work very hard to put these likenesses on the strongest footing they might, but at the end of the day, they make a call on what they deem believable and what not, so be careful taking any of their conclusions without giving them your own thought. Mark that if you start going down this path, then works of lore for <i>every other Indo-European folk</i> might have a bearing on what you can work out, but I've deemed those out of scope for this list, lest it grow to even more laughable length.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: A wonderful pulling-together of everything we had at the time this was printed on "where did the speakers of proto-Indo-European come from?" A lot of the genetic evidence hadn't been published yet, but this pulls together linguistic, archaeological, and comparative means to argue that the speakers of Proto-Indo-European came from the steppe just north of the Black Sea (modern-day Ukraine and Western Russia). Also a great example of how to make a multi-disciplinary argument thoroughly and fairly straightforwardly.

  The following couple of books (at the time of first writing this, both by Eirik Westcoat) are about poetry written for worship and/or magic. They also include some help in coming up with such poetry for yourself, which I have put to good use in my own soul-work.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: <i>Greatly</i> helpful work on prayers written following the ways of old Germanish poetry. Also holds <i>many</i> prayers written following such ways. A big help if you want to know either a) some prayers you might say to the Germanish Gods, or b) how to write your own prayers as a kind of poetry much like what pre-Christian worshippers used to the same ends.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: Much like his earlier work above, Westcoat here writes a lot of poetry to do with going through the course of study in <i>The Nine Doors of Midgard</i>. Especially helpful for those going after magical learning and/or worshiping Odin most of all.

  These books are more about "making stuff happen" and/or "learning about what might happen" using means that come from Germanish belief. Mostly that means the Runes used for divination or magical purposes, but there are some other linked ways of going about things as well.

  <p>
  As I said above, "shamanism" is a word that gets used for many unalike things, but the ways of the folks who live about the North pole gave us the name, and I think it likely those ways left some mark on the ways of the Norse at least, and maybe the wider Germanish world. The books below are all by Raven Kaldera and/or Galina Krasskova, and they have a way of looking at things that is rather unlike other folks, so take with as much salt as seems right to you.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Their take is that the beliefs and ways of working with Gods and spirits of the Germanish folks were shaped by shamanic ways of working, and this is meant to be a "how to" for a modern seeker.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: One thing that makes Kaldera somewhat controversial amongst the worshipers of Germanish Gods is his worship of and working with the <i>Jotnar</i>, the "giants" of Norse myth. Most folks see these as hostile or at least indifferent beings, and worship of them as not a good idea, but Kaldera says otherwise.

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-January-15
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org29f42b7"></a>The Rules<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org29f42b7">
  <p>
  For all of 2022, I set myself the goal of reading only books by writers who had
  died before I began reading it, unless the book was 1. needed for work, 2. about
  a hands-on skill that I put to work in 2022, or 3. written by a friend or kin.
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm glad I did it, I think it was good for me, and now I'd like to share a bit
  about how it went and what I learned.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org197ff63"></a>What Went Well<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org197ff63">
  <p>
  First off, I met my goal, so huzzah! Since I made this boast publicly and told
  my friends and family about it, it helped very much whenever I found myself
  wanting to bend or break my rules. One of my goals for the year was to read more
  old books, and this helped me do so. I also wanted to use it as a spur to read
  more "great" or otherwise intimidating books, and it helped me there as well -
  among others, I read Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i> (both volumes) and
  Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  This also drove me to think more about my reading and where I
  might look to answer a question - if I wanted to read about a something, I had
  to try to find a book about it by someone who was dead. Brand new field like the
  blockchain? Too bad, maybe this isn't the year for cutting edge stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
  When I found myself wanting to read books by living authors, I had to stew on it
  for a while. Sometimes I found that my yearning for a book cooled after a few
  weeks, but with a handful, I was literally counting the days to the New Year.
  I've already read two short books I'd been wanting to get to for months now, and
  it felt like a real treat to get to them at last.
  </p>

  <p>
  Another of my main goals was to open myself up to ways of thinking not tangled
  up in the trends and prejudices of today. Sure enough, these books were at times
  refreshing, shocking, or both.
  </p>

  <p>
  Altogether, I think this was great New Year's goal. It could bend to fit my
  changing tastes, needs at work, and even having a baby. On the other hand, it
  was spelled out well enough to make it easy to know if I was following it or not
  and binding enough to get me to act differently than I would have without it. If
  any of that grabs you, consider giving a shot sometime.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org7f613e4"></a>What Might Have Gone Better<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7f613e4">
  <p>
  While I think the goal was a good one and the year went well, there were a few
  less-thrilling things. First off, I read a <i>lot</i> less: 17 books against 46 in
  2021 (not including comics). To be fair to my goal, I don't think it's the only,
  or even the main, driver of why I read less - I would put that more on a larger
  teaching load, long books to read, a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinet/">note-taking system</a>, and most of all,
  having a new baby for the last few months of the year. I also got deeper
  into my spiritual practice and took up a bit of leatherworking over the summer,
  so there were those as well.
  </p>

  <p>
  Also, and this one might be thanks to my goal, it was much harder for me to get
  into most of the fiction I chose. When I really love a novel, I'll pick it up
  whenever I get a spare moment, whereas if I merely like it, it'll only get 10-15
  minutes before bed, if I don't just fall face first into bed. I also missed
  comics and graphic novels. It seems my tastes run much more with the times with
  fiction than non-fiction. Of course, there are lots of comics whose authors have
  died and every kind of fiction imaginable, but for whatever reason, this bit was
  less successful for me.
  </p>

  <p>
  I also could have set my rules more clearly for edge cases: does looking up an
  entry in a reference book count? How about finding a saying from something I've
  already read? Or checking a book's index for a key word? How about the book I'm
  getting meditation themes from? Or an art book where I'm looking at the
  pictures?
  </p>

  <p>
  I ended up settling on "referencing" not counting as "reading", and a small
  amount of skimming to get the gist of a book was okay, as long as I didn't
  linger too long on any bits. I counted meditation themes as "learning a hands-on
  skill" and looking at art books didn't count as "reading", though it was a good
  reminder to go look for older stuff instead of only looking at the latest art.
  </p>

  <p>
  I felt like all of this was in keeping with my why I set the goal, which was
  mostly for books I would read cover-to-cover but I would have felt better about
  it if I wasn't asking myself if I was "cheating."
  </p>

  <p>
  Likely the closest I came to fudging the goal was spending a <i>lot</i> of time reading
  blogs. Maybe too much time. Maybe time that would have been given to books if
  not for the goal.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, I read the whole archive of <i>Unqualified Reservations</i> and <i>Gray
  Mirror</i> by Curtis Yarvin, the former of which includes many series that have been
  sold as e-books. I ended up counting it as okay so long as I read it "as a
  blog" - in my browser, post-by-post, and in the order they were posted, not how
  they were put together for publication.
  </p>

  <p>
  This was more a case of sticking to the letter of my goal while bending the
  spirit a fair bit - I spent hours and hours reading long-form prose by living
  folks, about the same things I would have read books about if not for my goal.
  So, as much as the goal was meant to take away distractions so I could read
  stuff I might otherwise put off, reading blogs so much went against that.

  <li><a id="org7cd9a70"></a>What I'm Doing This Year<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7cd9a70">
  <p>
  This year (2023) I settled on a goal for output instead of input: every week I
  will put up a blog post. I'd like to post here to my webstead weekly, but in a
  crunch, I will count shorter/less polished pieces on my [dreamwidth journal] as
  meeting my goal.
  </p>

  <p>
  The thinking here is to get myself used to writing and sharing it with others
  often. If anyone bothers to read it, that's gravy.
  </p>

  <p>
  To meet this goal, I'll be treating the "week" as Monday to Sunday, though I'd
  like to get to where I'm posting in the middle of the week anyway and the point
  will be moot. Since consistency is my goal, "make up" posts are better than
  nothing, but more than 5 will be a loss. Likewise, more than 5 posts that are
  <i>only</i> placeholders (like one or two sentences that don't say much worth reading)
  will be a loss.
  </p>

  <p>
  Hopefully you'll join me for this trek, and we'll both find it worthwhile!

  </p>

  <p>
  I've always liked learning about mythology and religion, but most of my tries at prayer or worship left me cold. I gave it a shot for a bit in college, but by a few years ago, I had pretty well settled into a scientific materialistic atheism, or at least a pretty hard-edged agnosticism - I thought there was nothing reasonable you could say about things that weren't available to the five senses, so why speculate. Then, much to my surprise, about a year and a half ago (mid 2021), I had what seems to have been a pretty classic religious experience. Since then, I've been taking a new look at much of how I think about the world, and it's been a wild ride. At this point, I can still remember how the world looked as a materialist, but now I see things differently. Standing astride these two worldviews, I think I might be able to help out anyone looking across that chasm and wondering what's on the other side, and if it's worth finding a way over.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0ed3ed">
  <p>
  The reader I have in mind for this post is someone with a pretty firm grounding in how the world works - likely you know a basic outline of history, some understanding of physics and biology, and enough psychology that folks' day-to-day foibles don't surprise you too much. Maybe one of these fields grabs you more, and you've gone deeper there, but basically, you don't look at history, or technology, or politics and feel totally perplexed. Things may not be where you'd like, but they at least make sense. Amongst all of that, though, something's under-developed: a sense of meaning. Very likely you've read some philosophy, some self-help, maybe you've tried out meditation or gratitude journaling or the like. If your mostly-good-enough worldview falls short precisely at the most important questions ("what's it all about?", "what should I do with my life?", and so forth), then I hope this post might help you out.

  <li><a id="orgdbd26a9"></a>By "Spiritual", I Mean Whatever Makes Life Worth Living<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdbd26a9">
  <p>
  Before we go further, I wanted to pin down what I mean by "spiritual," since I'll be talking about it a lot below. Trying to define "spiritual" or "spirituality" is notoriously tough, so I'm going to go with an open-ended definition for this post. When I say "spiritual" (in this post at least), what I mean is whatever beliefs, experiences, and practices that strengthen the feeling that life is fundamentally good and worth living over the long-term. That last bit is important, because otherwise we might rope in a lot of short-term enjoyable experiences, like drugs or casual sex, that few folks would give much weight to as "spiritually significant". Also, I use the word "strengthen", because I don't think many things are well-served by a binary of "spiritual/not-spiritual." Maybe having an enchanting encounter with an attractive member of your preferred sex is "spiritual" if you've been feeling cold and lonely, but it is likely to be less spiritually weighty than building a life-long partnership with someone and raising a family. So, for my definition, "spiritual" is continuous, not categorical.

  <li><a id="orgcb8a08d"></a>Start From Where You Are<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcb8a08d">
  <p>
  The most important thing on the spiritual path is to take your own experience seriously. Questions of meaning and spiritual significance are deeply personal, and your answers are likely to be even more so. First, take stock of why you're even asking these questions - are you feeling bitter, depressed, or angry? Is life going "fine", but it feels like something is missing? Are there niggling little edges of your model of the world that don't quite work? Have you had an experience you can't wholly explain? Wherever you're starting, be honest with yourself. Folks often use "I'm just being honest" as an excuse to be overly harsh, even towards themselves. So don't do that, but also don't try to pretend everything is fine if it isn't. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Wherever you and your beliefs are, though, there are very likely things you can do to move your life toward something you like better. If you just can't take religious claims as anything other than wishful thinking for stupid people, if you try to pray or do rituals, it's going to feel hollow and dumb. So, if that's you, don't start there. Maybe something like reading philosophy and meditating on it could work for you. Maybe even that feels too "woo woo" for you: if so, try looking for some scientifically validated practices like gratitude journaling or getting regular exercise. If you feel like your mental/emotional state could be better, you're almost certainly right, but your path to get there is unlikely to be the same as anyone else's. Down the way, it might take you to some funky places, but for now, you have to start from where you are.

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org71d336d">
  <p>
  Okay, let's imagine that you've taken a good, hard look at your life and what you believe about it, and you're thinking something like "this isn't quite working for me."
  </p>

  <p>
  So, you settle on widening your outlook, and you start reading some folks outside of your comfort zone - self-help gurus, philosophers, religious folks, maybe even occultists. As you do, you run into things that leave you scratching your head at best or scoffing in disbelief at worst. One of the pitfalls of spiritual writers, especially alternative spiritual writers, is a whole lot of "woo". If you're coming from any kind of rationalist background, it's easy to run into stuff that you just can't take seriously at all. They are operating from an <i>utterly</i> different epistemological/metaphysical basis, and they take for granted things about the world that seem obviously wrong to you. You end up finding yourself in a wilderness of wild claims about how the world works and what might make your life better. Let's take a common example: most religious folks believe in the actual, external reality of one or more sentient beings that happen not to have bodies (Gods, angels, spirits, and so forth). If you are coming from a materialist viewpoint, this claim is patently nonsense. Those religious people then claim that talking to some of these non-physical beings can make your life much better. So, how do you handle this recommendation to start praying?
  </p>

  <p>
  Here's my take: look for writers that you find credible about <i>something</i>, and work on holding off judgment on the weirder, woo-woo-ier stuff they talk about. Look for fields where their judgment and reasoning make sense to you. Over time, you might find yourself going "this person is smart, grounded, and reasonable about just about everything, why does he believe this crazy stuff?" With a truly open mind, that's a helpful stead to find yourself in. If you think about it, you pretty much do this all the time -  everyone you know has a quirky set of beliefs about the world, some of which you'll hold with and some you won't. For one easy example, I'm willing to bet you have someone among your friends or kinsfolk that you like and think well of, but with whom you will <i>not</i> talk politics.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, when weighing the worth of spiritual writers, look at those of their beliefs about the world which you <i>can</i> more readily evaluate. Do they talk about history, or politics, or psychology, or literature, or other non-spiritual matters? Do they make sense when they do? The goal here is to ask yourself "does this person seem trustworthy overall?" If they seem nuts about everything, chances are good they're nuts about spiritual matters too. On the other hand, if they seem like calm, thoughtful folks with a clear outlook on the world, and yet they happen to believe something that seems obviously impossible to you, well, now that's interesting, isn't it? These are the folks you'll want to pay attention to.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga650810">
  <p>
  Since the definition we're using for spirituality here grounds out in how you live your life, there's a helpful rule of thumb you can apply to would-be spiritual teachers that comes from one of the best-known spiritual teachers of all time, Jesus: "by their fruits ye shall know them." In other words, look at what kind of outcomes this guy has in his own life. How does he treat others? Is he surrounded by scandal? Is his life a raging dumpster fire? It's always helpful to think through these questions when taking someone's advice, but it's even more weighty for philosophical or spiritual things, since their <i>whole point</i> is making your life better. Look out for folks who seem to make sense, but whose lives are a mess.

  <li><a id="org8e5e9f6"></a>Consciousness is Not Available to the Five Senses<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8e5e9f6">
  <p>
  One rationalist argument that I always found convincing was that you can't meaningfully reason about things that are not available to the five senses. In other words, if there are things about the world that we can't experience with our senses, we have no way of knowing about them for sure, so we shouldn't bother speculating. Further, since the world can seemingly be explained pretty darn well by those things that <i>are</i> available to the senses, it's very likely extraneous to assume there's anything else. This <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=161">post</a> by Eric S. Raymond is a good example of that kind of reasoning.
  </p>

  <p>
  I was pretty comfortable with such reasoning until I read <i>A World Full of Gods</i> by John Michael Greer. He made a point that blew a big hole in that comfortable line of reasoning. We <i>do</i> in fact have an important element of experience that is not available to the five senses: the contents of our consciousness. Thoughts, imaginations, emotions. These are obviously important parts of our experience, but they are not accessible to anyone's senses. The typical materialist explanation is that these experiences are just epiphenomena of the matter in our skulls, but that "just" is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting. If there's one hugely important area of our experience that is <i>not</i> amenable to the five senses, then there might be others. One area worth giving some consideration is one that every single human culture we have a record of (except ours recently) has found self-evident: the reality of spiritual beings.

  <li><a id="org671aab0"></a>Reason is a Helpful Tool, but Some Things are Subjective<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org671aab0">
  <p>
  What all of the above led me to is that reason is an incredibly helpful tool, but it's not the end-all, be-all for understanding the world and our experience of it. If you begin any kind of spiritual practice, even just journaling or meditating, you will run into a lot of experiences that you can't verify or validate with other folks - they will be wholly subjective to you. Some of those wholly subjective experiences might feel tremendously important, but you won't be able to <i>confirm</i> them empirically or through formal rationality. Does that mean you should ignore them or discount them?

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org497dfbb">
  <p>
  Okay, the above points were about the sources you check out and how you think about them, but this one is for you. From my own experience, what you think is true about the world is <i>much</i> less important than what you do. You might believe that it's great to treat everybody with loving-kindness, but if you keep acting like a dick, that's not worth much. I have some thoughts on what practices might be most helpful, but the core idea is <i>regular practice</i> - pick something you think will be good for you to do, and then do it every day. Meditation is a good choice, but there are others - like a gratitude journal, volunteering, yoga, prayer, and more. The okay thing you will do regularly is way better than the great thing you give up on.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org55c8317">
  <p>
  Some folks say that you should give spiritual practices a shot even if you don't believe they're "really real." Something like "pray even if you don't think anyone is listening." In my case, a few years back, I was convinced that rituals and spiritual practices were a useful way to get in touch with the archetypes of the unconscious, but I thought it was "all in my head." It seems that this works for some folks (see this <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html">post</a> from Eric S. Raymond for one example). So I tried it out - I called on Gods, did rituals, and so forth, but all while believing their "reality" was something wholly metaphorical. I felt silly. I couldn't get past feeling like I was talking to myself, so even though I kept at it for a while, it never stopped feeling like an empty waste of time. All of this is to say, if you can't get yourself to at least thinking "maybe there's somebody/something else out there," you might not have much luck with more explicitly religious practices like prayer, and maybe you should start with something else, like meditation.

  As I've stressed above, any grappling with spiritual matters you do will be deeply your own, and thus what works for you won't be what works for others. That being said, it can be hard to know where to start, so I'd like to share some ways of thinking about meaning that I have found helpful along the way.

  <li><a id="org68c090a"></a>Existentialism Says to Make Your Own Meaning<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org68c090a">
  <p>
  I've listed existentialism first, as it begins with a presupposition wholly in keeping with modern materialism: nothing is meaningful <i>in and of itself</i>. Instead, it is up to you to work out what is meaningful to you and why that matters. It can be a harsh pill to swallow, and it's one that I have since found doesn't meet my own spiritual needs, but existential thinkers tend to approach the problems with meaning with brutal clarity and how to tackle them with admirable courage. The single best work here has got to be <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> by Viktor Frankl. Nothing quite like a holocaust survivor's tale to put life's problems in perspective.

  <li><a id="org34e912c"></a>Self-Help Shows You How to Get Things Done<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org34e912c">
  <p>
  I spent years <i>very</i> into self-help stuff, mostly stuff by Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, Mark Manson, and so forth. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of helpful ways of dealing with stress, staying healthy, and being productive. Even so, you might say that I wouldn't even be writing this post if I had found the meaning I was looking for in this field. Most self-help seeks to appeal to a wide audience, and so takes few stands on deeper matters of meaning, instead either holding itself to smaller, more pragmatic things ("get in shape!" or "manage your finances!") or else grounds out in vague, woo-woo stuff of the "do what feels right to you!" kind.
  </p>

  <p>
  The other big flaw in a lot of self-help is that it's mostly about solving problems. Don't get me wrong, solving problems is great, but it's not always the right way to come at things. Is grief that your mother died a "problem" to be solved? If every Sunday night you have a gnawing sense of dread, does that mean you should learn the best strategy for getting a promotion, or might it be a token of something deeper? All that being said, I think <i>The War of Art</i> by Steven Pressfield is very worthwhile, and Tim Ferriss's work is still top notch for learning how to get real world stuff done.
  </p>

  <li><a id="orgd7d63ff"></a>Stoic Philosophy Tells You to Take the Reins of Your Feelings<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd7d63ff">
  <p>
  Unlike Existentialism, Stoic philosophy still pulls a lot of weight in my outlook. It is often pitched as fully in keeping with materialist belief, which it largely is, due to one of its main teachings: you can't control what happens in the world around you, but you can control how you think about it. Put enough work into steering how you <i>think</i> about what happens to you, and you can begin steering how you <i>feel</i> about things. Already, that's pretty worthwhile, and nothing about it goes against a materialist outlook.
  </p>

  <p>
  The other main teaching of the stoics follows from this and is a bit harder to square with materialism, but you can if you wrangle it hard enough: since you can not control the world around you, no outside measures of "a good life" can withstand everything that might happen. Instead, you should steer your thoughts (and feelings) by "virtue". The reason this is harder for a materialist is that it turns out it's <i>really</i> hard, maybe even impossible, to come up with a truly bullet proof definition of "virtue" on purely empirical grounds. You can certainly get to good enough for living your life, but if you're looking for epistemic certainty, it can leave some gnawing doubts. The classical stoics didn't have this problem, because they believed virtue came from a universal divine source.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to get started with Stoic philosophy, there are two good options: 1. <i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius and 2. <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> by Seneca. <i>Meditations</i> was the personal diary of a thoughtful and disciplined man, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> was the avuncular advice of a successful mentor helping a younger friend work out his life. You can't really go wrong with either, but <i>Meditations</i> comes off more like maxims and helpful self-talk, whereas <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> is more conversational and more understanding of the occasional misstep. Pick whichever of those grabs you more.

  <li><a id="orgd99b66e"></a>Meaningness Explores the Ambiguity of "Meaning"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd99b66e">
  <p>
  This is an online "<a href="https://meaningness.com">book</a>" that tries to tackle the problem of meaning, meaninglessness, and everything in between from a materialist-friendly Buddhist stand point. I think he does about as good a job as you possibly can if you take materialism as a key assumption. The heart of his argument is that most religious approaches put <i>too much</i> meaning on every damn thing, whereas nihilism puts <i>too little</i> meaning on stuff that everyone sees as meaningful unless you stop and think too hard about it. Instead, his take is that "meaning" is something rather ambiguous that all humans experience, partly by creating it and partly by responding to things in the outside world. Thorough, well-argued, and helpfully nuanced, maybe the best thing this book does is to make a telling, materialist-compatible case that nihilism is dumb and rationalism isn't an unassailable metaphysical/epistemological truth.

  <p>
  An adjacent couple of sets of writing I have found helpful is <a href="https://samzdat.com/">sam[]zdat</a> by Lou Keep and <a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/">Hotel Concierge</a>. These blogs begin with the same intellectual and cultural starting places as the wider "Rationalist" community, but wrestle much more with how far scientific evidence and logical reasoning can go when it comes to values and with the sometimes bad outcomes of reasonable courses of action with good intentions. Sadly, neither has posted in a long time.

  <li><a id="org846659a"></a>Religion Might Take You Some Places You Didn't Know About<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org846659a">
  <p>
  Or, maybe you've come a bit farther than I've been thinking, and you're at least open to the thought that all of this "spiritual" stuff is not <i>only</i> metaphorical, not <i>just</i> a pithy way to sum up thorny psychological, sociological, and cultural factors, but instead there might be <i>something</i> outside of yourself that you'd be better off coming to know. Given who I reckon is reading this, it's fairly likely that when I say "religion," what comes to mind is something that looks a lot like Protestant Christianity - either in its Fundamentalist Evangelical flavor or its Progressive Social Justice flavor. Either that, or some kind of westernized Buddhism, as I have heard humorously, but not wrongly, called "Richard Gere Buddhism". Notwithstanding my less-than-kind likenesses, if any of that grabs you, by all means, go forth and delve into that thing!
  </p>

  <p>
  For this post, though, I'm not going to say much on these, since I think you likely wouldn't be here if the ready-to-hand religious options did much for you. Instead, I'd like to draw your awareness to some <i>very</i> unalike choices. You see, religion of some kind is found amongst the folks of all lands, but between those lands, there are wildly unalike ways to deal with the spiritual world, many of which you might not have given much thought to. Here's a handful:
  </p>
  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>Does Christianity hold some weight with you, but the kinds you know don't work for you? Consider poking around "Tradcath" (Traditional Catholic) or Orthodox Christianity. C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton are some worthwhile writers here, and there are loads of writings, podcasts, and so forth to check out online, but it's not a field I've looked deeply into, so I don't know which to steer you toward.</li>
  <li>What if you can't get the claims of monotheism to make sense? The afore-said <i>World Full of Gods</i> does a wonderful job of spelling out why polytheism is worth taking earnestly, but if you'd like to give it a try yourself, check out <a href="https://kayeofswords.github.io/soulsinnerstatues/index.html">The Soul's Inner Statues</a> and pair with whatever mythology most speaks to you.</li>
  <li>India and Japan have thriving home-grown religions in the shape of Hinduism and Shintoism/Buddhism (they often run together in Japan). Both have a very wide set of practices, prayers, rituals, and so forth, most of which are deeply linked with the neighborhoods from which they spring - so much so that you likely need to go and see them in the flesh to fully get them, but if something grabs you from afar, why not at least read about it?</li>
  <li>Or how about the religious thinking and folkways of the sundry indigenous folks around the world? <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr. is a great starter for Native American Indian spirituality, and <i>Sand Talk</i> by Tyson Yunkaporta is one for Australian aboriginal people.</li>
  <li>If you're <i>really</i> quirky, you might think about looking into some of the West's alternative spiritual paths of the last few hundred years - Theosophy, Occultism, the Druidry Revival, and so forth.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  I've shared all of the above since I think a lot of folks feel like their lives are lacking spiritually, but the [options] they know about leave them cold. If neither megachurch Christianity nor Yoga-studio Buddhism do it for you, it turns out there's a <i>lot</i> more out there, some of which just might grab you.

  Whatever you find on your spiritual journey, remember that it is <i>your</i> journey. If religious or spiritual practices aren't working for you, then hey, they're not what you need right here and right now. On the other hand, if you find them worthwhile, don't let the fact that they seem weird or don't make sense to other people stop you from doing what works for you. It's hard enough to deal with your own doubts and those of your friends and kin if you find yourself drawn to Christianity or Buddhism or other widely-practiced religions, but it's even tougher if you find yourself drawn to something more out there. Praying to multiple Gods? Lighting incense? Putting on funny robes and walking around in circles? You might find yourself feeling a bit self-conscious, or worse. Whatever you do, the whole point of spiritual practice is to make better sense of yourself and your experience, and to enrich your life, so pay attention to how your practice makes you feel and what impact it has on your life, and don't let any hangups get in the way of that.
  </p>

  <p>
  It might turn out to be a long, weird ride, but it's worth it.

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-November-20
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm writing this post as much as a reference for me and as a place to point to whenever I make use of traditional Germanish metrical forms as anything else. For all of this, I am greatly indebted to Eirik Westcoat who has written a great deal of poetry in modern English using these forms for Heathen religious purposes, and lays out the rules very clearly in his book <i>Viking Poetry for Heathen Rites</i>. Note that this post has nothing to say about the other great thread in Germanish poetic tradition, which is the use of formal, stylized metaphors known as <i>kennings</i>, like the "whale road" for the sea or "flame of battle" for a sword. 
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org79765cb"></a>Rules Common to All Germanish Meters<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79765cb">
  <p>
  Once you start learning the meters given below, it becomes clear that they are all variations on a theme. That "theme" was likely an ancestral form of poetry practiced by the speakers of Proto-Germanic that speakers of all of the Germanish languages took with them and changed over time. The most complex forms are all from Old Norse, which retained an unbroken native language poetic tradition until the latest time. I find it easier to remember a few key "lego pieces" that all of the meters are made of:
  </p>
  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>Alliteration and syllable counts are the main focus of Germanish meters - other poetic considerations like rhyming, placement of stress, and so forth are sometimes found, but distinctly secondary in importance</li>
  <li>Only stressed syllables are counted for alliteration. In today's English, this is <i>usually</i> the first syllable, but not always, and it can be helpful to consult a dictionary, where stress is usually indicated with a "`" or similar symbol before the stressed syllable. Prefixes, like on-, be-, up-, un-, and so forth are often <i>not</i> stressed.</li>
  <li>Note that the above allows a lot of flexibility in stress placement, compared to Latin and Greek poetic forms, but you do still get some interesting rhythm from following the rules given below</li>
  <li>Consonant clusters that are pronounced as a single sound (th, ch, sk, sp, and so forth) alliterate with each other, rather than with the initial letter used in spelling. For example, "spelling" does not alliterate with "see", but does alliterate with "speak".</li>
  <li>All vowels alliterate with each other (or "assonate" with each other if you want to be picky)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org140616c"></a>Rules for Fornyrdhislag - "Old Song Meter"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org140616c">
  <p>
  This was one of the most common verse forms in Old Norse, and given its similarity to attested Anglo-Saxon and continental Germanish verse forms, it's likely pretty close to the Proto-Germanic kind of poetry from which all of these kinds sprang. Most of the other verse forms can be told of as changes to this one.
  </p>
  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>Usually written in eight-line stanzas</li>
  <li>The main unit of composition is the short line/half line, which must have 2 stressed syllables and usually has 4+ total syllables</li>
  <li>The alliteration is between pairs of these short lines (A and B), where the <b>first</b> stressed syllable of the second short line (B1) alliterates with <b>either or both</b> of the first or second stressed syllable of the first short line (A1 or A2)</li>
  <li>The second stressed syllable of the second short line (B2) <b>must not</b> alliterate with the first stressed syllable in that short line (B1), but it <i>may</i> optionally alliterate with either of the stressed syllables in the first short line (A1 OR A2). Due to the above rule, this means that if B2 alliterates, it may only alliterate with whichever A syllable B1 <b>does not</b> alliterate with</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org4a03269"></a>Fornyrdhislag Example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4a03269">
  <blockquote>
  O wise Woden,<br>
  Well-helped you are<br>
  by ravens quick-flying,<br>
  Flying around,<br>
  and steed eight-legged,<br>
  Stepping lively.<br>
  </blockquote>
  </div>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org82c8601"></a>Rules for Anglo-Saxon Long Lines<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org82c8601">
  <p>
  So far, this is the meter I have the most experience with, as it is fairly straightforward and bendsome, as well as coming from the same background as the Gods and Lore that I draw on the most. Almost the same as Fornyrdhislag, but with these changes:
  </p>
  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>Usually, two "half lines" are written/printed together to form the single "long line" of the verse name. These follow the same alliteration rules as the pairs of short lines in fornyrdhislag</li>
  <li>Half lines <i>must</i> have 4+ syllables each</li>
  <li>Write as many lines as needed to tell what you're trying to say - they are not broken into stanzas</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org23c040f"></a>Anglo-Saxon Long Lines Example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org23c040f">
  <blockquote>
  Standing at shoulder, | with shield steadfast,<br>
  Battle we welcome | with warriors bold.<br>
  </blockquote>
  </div>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf08e98b"></a>Rules for Galdralag - "Magic Spell Meter"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf08e98b">
  <p>
  This ones a bit trickier than either of the above, but relies on the same fundamentals as the above.
  </p>
  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>This comes in stanzas of four lines</li>
  <li>The first two lines follow the same rules as the short lines from fornyrdhislag, though the first line can be as short as two or three syllables</li>
  <li>The last two lines are longer, with three stressed syllables, any two of which alliterate</li>
  <li>The last line often, but not always, is a slight variation on line 3</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orga1b1a30"></a>Galdralag Example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga1b1a30">
  <blockquote>
  O spellweavers,<br>
  Wounded by spears,<br>
  Lost lives for wisdom<br>
  Wakened well for lore.<br>
  </blockquote>
  </div>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org1e0ebb9"></a>Other Meters<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e0ebb9">
  <p>
  There are other meters, some of which get pretty complicated, and I may add them to this post as I get experience with them, but I find the above give a pretty good base for coming up with many kinds of poems for prayers and other ends.

  <title>Why a Heathen Rosary?</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-September-25
  </p>

  <p>
  As I mentioned last time, I thought I had put forth what I was up to coming up with a "Heathen Rosary", but it turns out I hadn't, so I thought "why not now?"
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, it might be helpful to say what I mean by a "Heathen Rosary", since that could mean rather a few unalike things. In <i>Pagan Prayer Beads</i> by John Michael Greer and 'Clare Vaughn' (his wife's pen name for this work), they use "rosary" for any set of prayers tied to a set of prayer beads. Galina Krasskova <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/05/retooling-the-rosary/">"retooled" the rosary</a> with a set of prayers meant to be said on a set of beads made for the Christian Rosary and with the intent of keeping much of the rhythm of the Christian prayer, because she grew up around it and it was a foundational part of her early exposure to religious practice. My own take is somewhere in between these. I have never been Catholic, and the Rosary has never been a part of my spiritual practice. That being said, through prayer, meditation, and divination, I got the impression that I ought to come up with a prayer that takes advantage of much of what works well for the Christian Rosary, while still being customized for my own beliefs.
  </p>

  <p>
  Basically, I got the idea I ought to work out a prayer that is "like the rosary", and to make that happen, I decided I ought to learn more about the Christian Rosary. As such, I've been reading through the prayers of Rosary and some works about it. From this reading, the thing that has struck me most strongly is the Rosary's alternation between familiarity/repetition and novelty. Also, the Christian Rosary has a strong alternation of praying to the masculine and feminine aspects of the Catholic religion. So, I've been trying to work out how to get the best of these traits in a regular prayer without calling upon Christian religious figures.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, what I've come to is the <a href="#framework_for_a_heathen_rosary">Framework for a Heathen Rosary</a>. I'm still working out what the saying of intent and closing of each "group" of "Hail Iduns" should be, along with what the equivalent of the mysteries might be. My end goal is to have a set of prayers that share the Christian Rosary's balance between repetition and novelty, depth of theological ground covered, and alternation between masculine and feminine holy Beings, but that are said to the Gods and Goddesses I worship. On the contemplation side, I think that I will use Germanic myths, one myth in place of each "mystery", but I don't yet know how to group them. Divination has led me to make my beads with four sets of nine, and the main thread tying together the prayers, myth, and symbolism is the World Tree, Yggdrasil, but I'm still not entirely sure how to put all of that together. I'm also not sure how many groups of myths/mysteries to have, but I'm thinking maybe one for each of the Wyrds, or one for each day of the week, or one for each of the nine worlds, or something. I might have to start grouping myths together into groups of four and see how many meaningful categories I can infer.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once I'm through all of this, I'd like to have a set of prayers I can say daily with associated contemplative material that will stand as a fairly compact, but also fairly complete, devotional practice. I'll share more here as I actually work it out!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2022-September-18
  </p>

  <p>
  I started writing this post thinking that I had already introduced my goal of coming up with a "Heathen Rosary," but looking back, it seems I only briefly mentioned it in my <a href="#the_hail_idun_prayer">"Hail Idun"</a> post. So here's the short version: the Rosary is a longstanding contemplative prayer that has been spiritually valuable to a lot of folks all around the world and for a very long time. As such, it seems like a good model for coming up with a contemplative prayer in keeping with my own beliefs. Through prayer, meditation, and just plain thinking about it, I've come to a rough idea of what that prayer might look like, but I've still got a lot of work to do.
  </p>

  <p>
  I had hoped to be further along in working this set of prayers out by this point, but since I'm not, I thought I'd share what I do have so far. I haven't written out any of the prayers other than the "Hail Idun" Prayer, but I've gotten some idea of the shape those prayers will take.
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>A Saying of Intent</li>
  <li>Open each group of prayers with a prayer to Woden</li>
  <li>Say Nine "Hail Iduns"</li>
  <li>Close each group with a prayer that again affirms relatedness with the beings of the world</li>
  <li>Repeat for four groups</li>
  <li>Close with another saying of striving to live well</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  If you know the Christian Rosary, this pretty closely follows the framework there. That collection of prayers opens with the Apostle's Creed, has 5 groups of prayers (Decades), each of which begins with an "Our Father" and is made up of 10 repetitions of the "Hail Mary", and closes with a "Glory Be." At the end of the whole prayer is a closing prayer. The big difference in my group of prayers, other than praying to different spiritual beings, is that the opening and closing are less statements of <i>belief</i>, and more a statement of <i>intent</i>. For Christianity, stating what you believe to be true about the world is an important foundation of religious practice. Germanish religion, on the other hand, like most many-Godded beliefs, puts far more weight on what you <i>do</i> and how you relate to the Gods. As such, rather than a "creed", I plan to open with a statement of intention to live well and do right by the Gods, and for the closing prayer to reiterate this idea.
  </p>

  <p>
  Having nine "Hail Iduns" was a pretty obvious choice, given the prominence of 9 as a holy number in Germanish belief, but it was harder to figure out how many groups of prayers to say. I've come down on four groups for now, mostly because it is pretty close to the 5 groups of the Christian Rosary, but there are more instances of "fours" in Germanish myth than "fives". I haven't yet worked out how many groups of themes for contemplation (the "Mysteries" in the Christian tradition) to use, but I'm leaning toward using myths as the themes, and possibly grouping into three groups, such as the "Wyrd Mysteries, Werthende Mysteries, and the Schuld Mysteries."
  </p>

  <p>
  Another element that I think is quietly implicit in the Christian Rosary but that I intend to emphasize pretty heavily is the alternation between prayers to a masculine power and to a feminine power. In Christianity, that's Jesus and Mary, and for me, that will mainly be Woden and Idun. I think that this interplay of masculine and feminine is essential to how this particular set of prayers works, but it might also be influenced by Christianity being otherwise so heavily oriented toward the masculine. The other complicating factor is that the Christian theological world is comparatively simple compared to most polytheistic understandings of the world - you cover pretty much all of your theological bases by affirming the Trinity and then praying to God the Father in the way Jesus taught, and by affirming Jesus's role even in the prayers to Mary.
  </p>

  <p>
  For a polytheist, getting the same sense of praying to "everything overall" is much harder (and perhaps not needed?). In my case, I am seeing the unifying factor as the Tree of Life, Yggdrassil, and the relationships between the Gods, spirits, and other beings that it represents as what to call upon for "the whole holy world". I might also bring the Wyrds (Norns) into either the replacement for the "Glory Be" and/or the closing prayer. While specific divine beings, they are also embodiments of the workings of the universe and are connected with the Tree.
  </p>

  <p>
  Right now, I'm planning on writing prayers for each of these pieces following a traditional Germanish meter (likely "Anglo-Saxon Long Lines"), and I'll share them here as I get them written. As always, any thoughts or feedback are welcome.
  </p>

  <title>Looking Into the "Our Father"</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-August-21
  </p>

  <p>
  After my <a href="#lessons_learned_on_prayer_from_the_council_of_trent">earlier post</a> on the Catechism of the Council of Trent about the section "On Prayer", I went ahead and read through the rest of the section, which is a line-by-line treatment of the "Our Father". The catechism uses this prayer as an example of a single, sufficient prayer for Christian practice. While I am not a Christian, I find the thought of having one prayer that is a wholly sufficient baseline an especially interesting one, and I thought that it would be helpful to look in detail at what the Council of Trent had to say about the "Our Father". 
  </p>

  <p>
  Since I'm not a Christian, my main interest is in thinking through what crafting such a prayer for another faith might mean. Of course, I'm especially interested in coming up with such a prayer for my own faith, but to try to make this helpful for others, I'd like to generalize as much as possible.  Lastly, though much of the prayer is particularly Christian, there is much within the prayer that is inspiring and beautiful for any spiritual path, and might be worth thinking through how to emulate in other faiths, and I'd like to highlight that as well.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orga519681"></a>The Progression of the Prayer<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga519681">
  <p>
  The Council of Trent broke down the prayer line-by-line and talked about what each line meant on its own, but also as a logical progression. The heart of it seems to be that you start universal, end universal, and have more particular asks sandwiched in-between. Each thing asked for also works both as a "plain" request for something obvious, and as a more sophisticated spiritual statement.
  </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org77ce18b"></a>Our Father, Who Art in Heaven<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org77ce18b">
  <p>
  The prayer begins by calling upon a loving father, not a harsh or distant lord. By specifying "our" father, the prayer also acknowledges that all men are brothers, and God is the father of all. Since Christians believe God to be everywhere, "Who art in Heaven" at first doesn't make much sense, but it serves to draw attention to the noblest part of visible nature, the sky, and asks those praying to compare that with God. More personally, by placing the highly personal figure of a "father" in the highly spiritual locale of "heaven", the prayer immediately establishes a link between personal practice and the transcendental goods sought through spiritual practice.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org28ccdfd"></a>Hallowed Be Thy Name<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org28ccdfd">
  <p>
  The Council of Trent recognizes that God's name can be nothing but hallowed in an abstract sense, but instead frames this bit of the prayer as a recognition, and a plea by the one praying to treat the name of God as holy. More subtly, the Council argues that all things that are good and hallowed are encompassed by God's name, and that this part of the prayer recognizes that. It also serves as a reminder to those praying to try to bring holiness to God's name through their actions outside of prayer, which will serve as an encouragement to any folks whose belief might be wavering.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org8a78b7a"></a>Thy Kingdom Come<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8a78b7a">
  <p>
  The Council of Trent puts this forward as the highest possible good and says that it holds all other goods that might possibly be asked for - anything that might be truly good is actually a part of the Kingdom of God, and anything not a part of the Kingdom of God only seems good, but isn't truly so. This part of the prayer is meant to remind believers to notice how much better the goods of the Kingdom of Heaven are than the goods of this world, but also as an encouragement to bring as much of the Kingdom of God into the world as possible.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga6296bf"></a>Thy Will Be Done<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga6296bf">
  <p>
  This is one that is seemingly at first the most strongly associated with purely Christian theology, yet that maybe has useful lessons for other faiths as well. The core idea is that the one praying ought to acknowledge that what he thinks he wants might actually not be such a great idea, and instead that he should gladly accept what the God prayed to believes to be best. Christians justify this position with original sin - because you are fundamentally flawed and cut off from the Divine, whatever you will to happen is tainted, and so you should instead seek the will of the higher power, who is untainted. Even without original sin, though, you can pretty readily get to the idea that what we think is best might not have all the needed information. The world is a big, complicated place, and we are just some moderately clever social apes - why on earth would we think that we know what's best for us? If you believe in the idea of a God or Gods at all, you should trust that they know a bit better than we do, from our highly limited material points of view.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf70a601"></a>On Earth as It Is in Heaven<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf70a601">
  <p>
  This bit was especially interesting to me, as I learned something I hadn't ever considered before: the Council of Trent says that "On Earth as It Is in Heaven" applies equally to "Hallowed be Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," and "Thy will be done." I had always only read it as an extension of "Thy will be done" and nothing else. On the one hand, this clause acknowledges the contrast between that which is spiritual and that which is worldly, but on the other, it also works as a thanksgiving, to the degree that God's name is hallowed, His kingdom has come, and His will is done in this world. More broadly, it acknowledges the perfection of Heaven and the lack of perfection in the material world and expresses longing for the material world becoming more like the perfect spiritual world.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org3d94beb"></a>Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d94beb">
  <p>
  Here we at last come to the asking for day-to-day, bodily things. One of the points the Council of Trent makes is exactly that the asking for bodily things comes only after asking for the highest and most spiritual things. I also appreciate the amount of meaning they find in the few words in this line. Asking for "our" daily bread acknowledges that you have to work, but you also rely on God's help for anything good that comes into your life. Asking for "daily" bread acknowledges that you're asking for what you need everyday - necessities, not luxuries. "This day" acknowledges that what you had yesterday might not come automatically today - you can't take these things for granted and should keep on being thankful so long as you have what you need. Lastly, "Give us" rather than "give me" encourages the one praying to think not only of himself, but of the needs of all of his fellow men.
  </p>

  <p>
  Even if you are not Christian, this is an impressive amount of religious meaning to pack into one line! I think it's maybe significant that we're really getting to the richest lines of the prayer when we turn from asking for high-level spiritual goods to normal, earthly needs.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org258e119"></a>Forgive Us Our Trespasses as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org258e119">
  <p>
  This might be considered the heart of the Christian belief system, and might be the part of the prayer least easily adapted to other beliefs. Don't get me wrong, I think that forgiveness is an important part of many religious beliefs, but in Christianity, it is <i>the</i> belief, and so the line in the most common Christian prayer that most directly deals with forgiveness deserves a bit of attention. Once again, the plural subject ("forgive <b>us our</b> trespasses as <b>we</b> forgive those who trespass against <b>us</b>") does a lot of heavy lifting - this is not only asking for help with one's own forgiveness, but for all of mankind to get better at this very hard skill. Like other parts of the prayer, this one acknowledges the work done by both the one praying and God, in partnership. Lastly, one thought I found especially helpful from the Catechism was that folks might avoid saying the whole prayer, or at least this bit, if they had folks they couldn't yet forgive. In other words, if someone had someone against whom they were still nursing a grudge, they might hold off saying the "Our Father", or at least the line about forgiving trespasses. The Council of Trent very strongly came down on the belief that this was a mistake. More broadly, I think the idea that we ought to pray for the things we <i>wish</i> were true about us, even if we currently fall short, is a useful one.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org5f73b17"></a>And Lead Us Not Into Temptation<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5f73b17">
  <p>
  This is another bit where the Council of Trent makes some rather Christian assumptions - that "temptation" is something the Devil does and that is an unquestionable feature of existence. That being said, I think anyone who has been alive past childhood has experienced the draw of thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors that some part of them more readily dismisses. What I thought was most helpful in the Council of Trent's analysis was the notion that temptation is an intrinsic part of being alive, and so no amount of prayer will get you to a life "without temptation" - instead, the goal is no more temptation than you can handle with God's help. This seems both a. much  more do-able, and b. more consistent with other theological interpretations. For example, Christian theology might have it that making love to a bunch of strangers is lustful and therefore bad. On the other hand, if you belong to a belief that has looser beliefs about sex, you might still believe that having sex with strangers might be bad if a. you've pledged yourself to someone else, or b. it gets in the way of forming a more serious relationship with one person. In this case, the "temptation" to have sex with multiple new folks might still be very strong, but the Christian and non-Christian beliefs about why it should be avoided would be different, even if they came up with the same recommendation.
  </p>

  <p>
  Lastly, I appreciate the reminder that this part of the prayer is useful both for dealing with "avoiding temptation" in the abstract, or in general, and also in the moment to resist specific temptations. Whatever negative stuff you want to avoid, you should likely pray for daily, as well as whenever you find yourself needing help in the moment.

  <li><a id="orge9f4962"></a>But Deliver Us From Evil<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge9f4962">
  <p>
  Much as "Thy Kingdom Come" holds all of the good you might ask for in any prayer, so "deliver us from evil" holds the wish to have everything not good taken away. In some sense, everything asked for above is held within this - as all of the good things asked for are, in fact, the lack of evil. One nice thing about this bit of the prayer is that folks tend to pray to get rid of what's wrong anyway, even if not especially religious ("no atheists in foxholes" and so forth). All that being said, this bit of the prayer is at the end, because asking for spiritual goods is more important overall. Also, some seeming "evils" might actually be good for our souls. Lastly, this says "from <b>Evil</b>", rather than "from <b>evils</b>", as Christianity sees all evil as coming from one source (the devil), and acknowledges that some material circumstances might seem evil, while actually being good for you - this way of praying allows for experiencing things that seem crappy in the moment, but might be for the best in the long run.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org28112f2"></a>Amen<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org28112f2">
  <p>
  The prayer ends with a word rich with weight from scripture. Most importantly, "amen" works as a "seal" to mark the prayer as done, but with a feeling of gladness. In Catholic ceremonies, the congregation does not say "amen", but instead the priest says "amen" back to them, which they treat as a sign that the prayer has been heard and will be acted upon. According to the Council, even when praying alone, "amen" can work as a glad celebration of coming closer to God, a reminder of what the prayer just finished was truly for.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org60e715d"></a>The Theology of the Prayer<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60e715d">
  <p>
  Now, one thing I kept running into while reading the Council's analysis was that their arguments were cogent, coherent, and self-consistent - <i>if you accept Christian theology</i>. If your beliefs differ, it's a bit less helpful. Even so, I think that identifying the main strands of theological belief will be helpful in coming up with what others might get out of an analysis of the "Our Father".
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, the prayer is assumed to be directed to the single source of all goodness, God. If you are coming from a non-monotheistic standpoint, you might see the value in having a single source of all goodness, but you might not attribute it to a single "God". Regardless of what this source of all goodness is, the prayer opens by addressing it joyfully, follows up by wishing for it to be realized in the world as much as possible, and then acknowledges that all day-to-day material goods also come from this source of all goodness, and closes by acknowledging that we all fall short of what we would like, and asking for help in doing the right thing.
  </p>

  <p>
  Secondly, since this is, in fact, a Christian prayer, we have to deal with concept of original sin. Original sin is implicit in much of the prayer, and explored in more depth by the Council's analysis. The entire prayer basically assumes that the one praying is in a fallen state and needs redemption, and that this prayer is one of the chief tools in seeking and achieving that end. Obviously this comes out most clearly in the lines about forgiving trespasses, leading not into temptation, and delivering from evil. As I'll get into below, this strikes me as likely one of the biggest theological differences another faith would have to work around if looking for inspiration from this prayer. Related to this is the single source of all Evil mentioned above, which has a certain tidiness to it, but again, doesn't jive with everyone's view of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thirdly, much of the prayer expects those praying to do their share of the work, which I find quite interesting, and likely useful to apply outside of a Christian context. Though God is acknowledged as all powerful and the author of all good things, at least according to the Council of Trent, the one praying still has to do work and pray and believe and otherwise live consistently with what's being asked for, rather than just sitting back and waiting for God to handle everything. That might be the element of the Council's analysis that I found most interesting - it consistently stressed the active, engaged role folks need to take to get the most of prayer specifically and their spiritual life more broadly.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org68dc0f6"></a>What Can We Learn for Other Faiths?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org68dc0f6">
  <p>
  Despite the challenges of generalizing from a strongly Christian starting point, I think that there are some helpful lessons for crafting prayers for other faiths. Structurally speaking, I rather like the progression of the "Our Father" - as mentioned above, it begins by naming to Whom the prayer is addressed, asks for/affirms faith in the highest good things that Being can give, goes into more earthly requests, and closes with another universal, but this time "flipped" (deliver us from Evil rather than grant us the Kingdom of Heaven). So, I think that following the structure for prayers in other faiths would not present too much of a challenge, and could even be followed pretty closely, if wanted, by substituting in things appropriate to the Being prayed to. My <a href="#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of Fallhall's Prayer</a> is pretty close to that.
  </p>

  <p>
  What gives a bit more of a challenge is looking at the prayer's theology and thinking through how to craft a prayer that fulfills a <i>functional</i> role similar to what the "Our Father" does for Christianity, even if it's actual structure is different - ideally, one that also functions as a "single, sufficient prayer" for a different system of belief. Drawing on the theological threads we stepped through above, the three core things we identified the prayer doing functionally are 1. acknowledging/celebrating the source of all Goodness, 2. seeking redemption as a sinful being in a fallen world, and 3. calling upon the one praying to show his faith and belief by living a life consistent with what is asked for in the prayer. 
  </p>

  <p>
  These are highly specific to the Christian faith, and if we want to write a prayer for another faith, we'll have to express some different things. So, I've taken the three threads above and generalized them further: 1. is either the highest good, its source, or both, 2. is whatever this faith most seeks, what "problem it solves", and 3. is an affirmation to live consistent with your beliefs. For example, for Druidry, 1. might be the concept Awen, 2. might be knowledge, power, and peace, and 3. might be asking to live in harmony with nature. This might be harder for religions that don't have something as clear cut that they seek as Christianity is about seeking forgiveness for sins, or a more multi-faceted concept about what the highest good is or where it comes from.
  </p>

  <p>
  Altogether, I haven't worked out a prayer for my own beliefs following these recommendations yet, but I am glad I went through this exercise, I think it's been a helpful step, and I look forward to coming up with something.

  <title>The "Hail Idun" Prayer</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-August-14
  </p>

  <p>
  Keeping on with taking Christian prayers and writing a Heathen prayer as close to their shapes as I can, I've taken the "Hail Mary" and written the "Hail Idun". Idun is very important to me and my spiritual practice, and I think it likely that once I get to my goal of a full "Heathen Rosary", some kind of "Hail Idun" (whether this, or in Germanic metre or something else) will likely be the heart of the practice.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgf55058f"></a>Hail Idun<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf55058f">
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Hail Idun<br />
  Full of love<br />
  Brego* is with Thee.<br />
  Beloved art Thou amongst the Wen**<br />
  And blessed is the fruit of Thy tree, Life.<br />
  Holy Idun, Lady of Birch,<br />
  Awaken our hearts<br />
  To the wider world of our souls.<br />
  Alu.<br />
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  <i>*Brego is possibly an Old English form of Bragi, God of Poetry and Idun's husband, who may or may not be a hypostasis of Odin/Woden. I picked it because it sounded better than "Bragi" to me.
  **Wen is one take on the plural of *Wan, the hypothetical Old English form of the Old Norse Vanr, Vanir. Others suggest "Wanes", though there's no direct textual evidence for the word either way in Old English, and some folks question whether the Anglo-Saxons believed in the same two tribes of Gods as the Old Norse did.</i>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-August-05
  </p>

  <p>
  After asking for some resources on prayer on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/190418.html?thread=32258258#cmt32258258">past Magic Monday</a>, samchevre pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_catechism_of_the_Council_of_Trent/Part_4">The Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>. Sure enough, despite its explicit Catholic Christian focus, I found a lot of good thinking on prayer as a practice, and I'd like to share what I thought were the most helpful takeaways for folks of any faith.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org6af98fd"></a>1. Kinds of Prayer<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6af98fd">
  <p>
  <b>Asking for Things</b>: Maybe the most common kind of prayer, the Council of Trent held that it was right and proper to ask God in prayer for anything it was right for folks to have. While it is certainly possible to ask for the wrong kind of things in prayer, and it takes some practice to ask for the right kind of things (more on both below), the evidence we have from just about every spiritual tradition that has recorded prayers shows folks asking the Gods for things that they want. If done right, this is not just a "gimme, gimme!" or a business transaction, but instead a way of acknowledging that you can't do <i>anything</i> in the world without your wider context and the help of the Holy.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Thanksgiving</b>: Even if you are uncomfortable with asking for things in prayer, I think it's hard, if not impossible, to find anything wrong with prayers of thanksgiving. Even materialists <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-happiness-research/">acknowledge how worthwhile being consciously thankful is</a>. Even more so than asking for things in prayer, giving thanks for what you have in this life is a good way to acknowledge that you are dependent on wider and higher things.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org644bc21"></a>2. Outcomes of Prayer<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org644bc21">
  <p>
  <b>Bringing You Closer to the Holy</b>: I think the biggest thing prayer does for you is to bring you closer to the Holy and open you up to its influence. However you pray, it's a way to take some time to think about and reach out to whatever you think of as Holy, and hopefully to listen for some kind of answer. Many spiritual practices can do this, but prayer has the strengths of being ready to do whenever and wherever you are, and being changeable to whatever your needs are right now.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Acknowledging Something Greater than Yourself</b>: I talked about this in both kinds of prayer above, but most any kind of prayer leads you to acknowledge that you need the wider world and its God(s). Even for things you did "by yourself", you still have your parents, teachers, employers, and culture to thank, to say nothing of any Gods or Goddesses. While humility can go too far into abasing yourself or groveling, most of us can use a timely reminder that we are not an island and that the world has given us a great many gifts that we ought to be thankful for.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Giving a Gift</b>: Prayer can also be a gift to the Gods, the same as incense or a candle or mead. The more care and thought you put into the prayer, and the better it is said, the better it works as such. This is the most helpful when you lack the means to give something else, but is still worthwhile even if you have all of the offerings you might wish for.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Helping the Dead</b>: Most faiths believe that the dead can use some help in the afterlife, and that prayer is one way of offering that help. For Christians, you pray for souls in Purgatory, other faiths might pray for souls to learn the lessons of their past life as smoothly as they might so they can move on to another life, and so forth. Whatever you believe about the afterlife (well, I guess, unless you don't believe in one), it seems that prayer is helpful to those in it.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org2186f92"></a>3. How to Pray<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2186f92">
  <p>
  <b>Prayer Works Best as a Habit</b>: The Catechism talks about prayer as a "duty", not something nice-to-have or optional. I don't know if that way of thinking is true for all faiths, but I think it is very much true that prayer works best as a habit, something you do at least every day. Much of the good of prayer only seems to come when you have done it for awhile with unalike things going on in your life. From what I have seen, it seems best to find many little ways to bring prayer into your life - something to say when you wake up, when you go to sleep, before you eat, when you put on a worn holy symbol, and so forth, as well as a "main" prayer set aside as its own thing. Of course, all of this doesn't have to be piled on at once, as that's not how good habit-building works, but over time, adding such things helps to make prayer a given, rather than something that takes will and forethought.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Pray in the Right Frame of Mind with the Right Feeling</b>: For Christians, the Council of Trent recommends that Christians go into prayer with 1. utmost humility, 2. sorrow or regret for sins done, 3. a lack of unworthy feelings like wrath or pride, and 4. faith in God. Once praying, the prayer should be heartfelt, with the ideal being that you "pour out" what is in your heart and soul with great warmth. I feel like the strong weight put on humility and sinfulness may not fit with every other faith, but the heart of the thought, that you should put yourself in a frame of mind in keeping with what is best to your Gods and then pray earnestly and with true feeling, seems like a good one to me.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Ask for the Right Things</b>: The Catechism gave what struck me as a remarkably good rede about asking for things in prayer. First, get in the habit of asking God(s) for all things that you want in your life. Second, practice only asking for things that bring you closer to God(s). This is a really good way to build habits - you start by harnessing your natural yearning to have stuff to get you to pray often. Hopefully, as you do this, you start thinking about and acknowledging the role of the Holy in bringing good things into your life. Having gotten used to thinking about God(s) shaping what comes into your life, you can more readily think about what kinds of things God(s) might most want you to do in the world, and you can start asking for that. Through this change, you learn to ask for the right things, which makes even your prayers asking for stuff into a way to come closer to the Holy.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Beware Prayer Becoming a Way to Do Unworthy Things</b>: For all the good that prayer can and does do, it can also become hollow, or even worse, truly harmful. If you only say the words or go through the motions, not only won't you get much out of prayer, you might sour on it or even on the Holy. There's some place for "fake it till you make it" in any kind of habit building, but if prayer feels hollow for a long time, it's likely not doing you any good, and you might need to work out a new way of doing things. Still worse is if you let prayer become a tool for your pride - showing off, making a big fuss about how strong your belief is, or the like. The Council refers to Jesus's well-known rede to pray indoors, out of the public eye. I think there's a role for public prayer, but a good rule of thumb seems to be that if you <i>only</i> pray when others are watching, you're likely doing it wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>A Lone Sufficient Prayer Can Be Helpful to Have</b>: The Catechism puts forth the "Our Father" as a wholly sufficient prayer by itself. In other words, as a Christian, if you only pray the Our Father, you're doing everything you need to do with prayer. Other prayers are helpful and do a lot of good, of course, but they say that you only really <i>need</i> this one prayer. I found this a highly interesting thought. I think it would be very helpful to look at your faith and ask yourself "if I could only say one prayer for the rest of this life, and I wanted to get at everything that is most important in my faith, what would that prayer be?" I think that most faiths likely don't have a ready-to-go answer the way Christianity does (perhaps the "Bond Among Druids" for Revival Druidry), but that writing it would be a worthy goal to strive for.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Some Hands-On Tips</b>: The Council also gave a handful of more hands-on tips that I thought were helpful: 1. "Mental Prayer" (praying without speaking out loud) not only works, but is often best suited to sharing strong, deep feelings. That being said, praying out loud helps you stay focused and can be a spur to feelings of devotion. 2. Food and drink can make it harder to have the right mindset or feeling for prayer, so it might be best to pray without having eaten or had drinks besides water for some time. Fasting can also bring on an even stronger feeling for prayer. 3. Try to make your deeds outside of prayer line up with what you ask for in prayer. If you ask for help, but give no help to others, you shouldn't think that will work out well for you.

  <p>
  This started out as at least half a joke, but as I worked through it, I was like "huh, maybe this isn't all bad". The Lord's Prayer is one of the few pieces of my lukewarm Christian upbringing that really stuck in my mind, and I've always appreciated its cadence, so I tried to keep that as much as possible here while making the concepts fitting for a prayer to Woden. That being said, I'm <i>really</i> new at this prayer/poetry thing, so I'm sure I'll look back at this in a bit and cringe.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Allfather, who art in Fallhall,<br />
  Awesome be Thy name.<br />
  Thy walkyries come, Thy will be done,<br />
  On fields choosing the winners.<br />
  Teach us this day our daily lore,<br />
  And welcome us as wayfarers,<br />
  As we welcome those who wayfare amongst us.<br />
  Lead us not into shamefulness,<br />
  And unshackle us from fetters.<br />
  For Thine is the wisdom,<br />
  and the greatness, and the lordship,<br />
  As long as this age shall last.<br />
  Alu.<br />

  <p>
  Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is the thrown-out plastic water bottle in an otherwise spotless stream. It is the streaming comedy that rings brittle and hollow. It is the buzzing of a notification for a social media app. It is the sneering look of cynical contempt that curdles a young face.
  </p>

  <p>
  Call it ennui. Call it anomie. Call it nihilism. Call it by whichever French philosophical word you like. It is an <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">Immoral Maze</a>. It is <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk</a>. It is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.
  </p>

  <p>
  So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.

  <title>Destinations and Journeys</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-January-22
  </p>

  <p>
  The other day, I read <a href="https://open-space.dreamwidth.org/8001.html">this post</a> the other day by an online acquaintance, which reinforced the old-but-good maxim that it is not the destination that matters, but rather the journey. I agree with this, but in responding to the post, I had a few thoughts on it that I thought I'd get down and post here.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgba6deb4"></a>The Destination is not the <i>Goal</i><br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgba6deb4">
  <p>
  So, you've likely heard some variation of this fortune-cookie-style wisdom before, that the journey is what matters, not where you're going. As I said above, I think this is mostly true and worth keeping in mind, since our psychology and society often push us into laser-focusing on the destination with remarkable tunnel vision. It's helpful to be reminded that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo">"life moves pretty fast - if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."</a> Also, every single successful person you ever talk to will tell you that the experience of achieving what they were after was nowhere near as engaging and interesting as the pursuit. Also, paradoxically, if you start out overly focused on outcomes and end points, you might just miss out on developing what you need to develop to even reach them at all. Often, focusing on the process instead of the goal is <i>how</i> you get to the goal at all. But notice in all of these examples, we're still talking about goals and destinations, they're still assumed.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org9f2eec4"></a>Destinations are <i>Excuses</i> for Journeys<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9f2eec4">
  <p>
  Okay, so journeys = good and destinations = bad, right? We should just stop setting goals or having specific places to go, right? Well, maybe not so much. There's a difference between a journey and wandering - the destination. So, we have a bit of a paradox. We want to value destinations less than journeys, but we need destinations to have journeys. What I realized in responding to my friend's post is that destinations are <i>excuses</i> for journeys - necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for what we're looking for. I keep having this insight over and over again playing with my daughter - I'll get frustrated that she's being slow to take her turn on Candy Land, or that she gets distracted by a stick while kicking her soccer ball into a goal. On my better days, though, I'll catch myself and realize "oh, right, achieving the 'goal' of this activity isn't actually why we're doing this, it's so that she can have fun and spend time with me and learn things". Another helpful example for me is playing games. Within the game itself, sure, you're playing to win, but you're <i>really</i> playing the game to have fun with your friends, so you likely shouldn't act like a dick to try to win. So how do we recognize that we need destinations so that we'll take journeys, while not attaching too much importance to them?

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga9ba279">
  <p>
  I like to think about it as something similar to the advice to have "strong opinions, loosely held" that you'll run into in the startup world. It's helpful to have specific goals or destinations, maybe even ambitious ones, but not to focus on them so hard that you lose sight of what's around you on the way. One thing I think helps do this is to be suspicious of "efficiency", when that means "get to the outcome as fast as possible". Sure, sometimes efficiency is worthwhile, but only when it is compatible with whatever other goals or values the journey might be meant to support. If you purposely chose to take the scenic route for the sights and stops, it's foolish to speed once you get on it. If you asked your kid to help clean up so she learns to be helpful and responsible, then it's dumb to do things for her because she's slow about it. If you started a company to have freedom and autonomy, it's foolish to take a deal that puts you in someone else's pocket. So, to properly value the journey, we have to think about not where we're going, but why we chose that end point in the first place, and be ready to adjust along the way.

  <title>Reading Goal for 2022</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2022-January-05
  </p>

  <p>
  This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:
  </p>

  <p>
  <i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?
  </p>

  <p>
  A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="https://fs.blog/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="https://fs.blog/choose-your-next-book/#2-the-lindy-effect">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

  </p>

  <p>
  For now, I'm lucky enough to get to share my thoughts with students every semester. That being said, there's a lot of stuff that I think is really helpful that I can't justify sharing in my course, as it's not so much about "business" or "communication". So, I reckoned I'd gather up that kind of thing here. Mostly, it's stuff I wish I had known when I was younger, so it ought to be very helpful to young folks. On the other hand, I wasn't all that young when I learned a lot of this, so you might still find something helpful here even if you're not so young.
  </p>

  <p>
  Given that this is the internet, and that I teach at a university, I feel like I have to say clearly that these are my own views, and not those of my employer. I've posted them here to help maintain some of that distance. If you see anything here that upsets you, I'd like to hear from you so we can talk it over, especially if you're one of my students.

  <p>
  Let's start with some things that I have found very helpful in learning how to think.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgaa7a5a2"></a>Learn and Use Mental Models<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaa7a5a2">
  <p>
  My good friend Jonathan introduced me to "mental models", which are perhaps best explained by the blog <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a>, but here's the short version: different fields have their own ways of thinking about the world, and many of these ways can be applied outside of their home field. Naming these ways of thinking as more-or-less contained "models" makes it easier to remember and apply them in a variety of situations. The other reason it's helpful to think of them as separate "models" is that it reminds you that they are just that: useful abstractions that help you understand the world, not the raw, objective truth.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgc218fe0"></a>Learn How to Read a Book<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc218fe0">
  <p>
  Anyone who wants to read books for more than fun needs to read <i>How to Read a Book</i> by Adler and Van Doren. If you haven't read it, your education has a serious gap. They break down reading into four levels: 1. Elementary, 2. Inspectional, 3. Analytical, 4. Syntopic. 1. <i>Elementary reading</i> is what you learned in grade school: marks on a page form meaningful words - that's all most folks know how to do. 2. <i>Inspectional reading</i> could be called "intelligent skimming" - you shoot to get the most out of a book in a fixed amount of time. 3. <i>Analytical reading</i> is where things get interesting. This is when you want to get the most out of a book, <i>period</i>. You take all the time you need to grok it in fullness. 4. <i>Syntopic reading</i> is when you want to understand a concept or field of study and so you read a lot of works by different authors and make sense of them all together. Even if you don't follow the exact scheme of this book or the techniques it outlines, I think it is very useful to have an idea of different levels of reading depending on what you're trying to do, and to apply them intentionally.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org27d3c4e"></a>Use Divergence and Convergence<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org27d3c4e">
  <p>
  I was introduced to this pair of concepts by my former boss Tony, who learned them by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Basadur">Dr. Min Basadur</a> and becoming certified in his creative problem solving approach (which is currently called <a href="https://www.basadur.com/simplexity/">"Simplexity"</a>). In creative thinking, you have two processes which are both necessary, but are better done separately: "diverging" and "converging". <i>Diverging</i> is where you try to generate as many options as possible. <i>Convergence</i> is when you evaluate the options generated and try to pick the best ones based on whatever criteria is relevant. These two ways of thinking use very different mental processes, and they interfere with each other. This approach applies in a surprisingly broad number of fields: in writing, you want to write a crappy first draft and edit, if you're figuring out where to go to dinner with your friends, throw out any options you can think of without worrying about if any of them are 'good', and only <i>then</i> pick something from that list. So, any time you're trying to solve a problem, first come up with as many options as you can, pause, and then look at those options and ask which ones work. Repeat as needed. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgdf72067"></a>Seek Out Old, Weird Things<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdf72067">
  <p>
  Don't waste your time trying to fit in. Not because fitting in isn't important - it is. But that shit will take care of itself. Even the weirdest, most against-the-grain bastard you can think of is still a product of his time and culture. So, unless you are already a hermit living deep in the woods, cultivate an interest in the obscure, the far off, and the long ago. Even though there are certain charms to eccentricity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYpsdBJlBcU">in and of itself</a>, that's not what I'm pushing here. In a big, highly-linked world, your best hope for being valuable is to bring a combination of talents and knowledge to the table that <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/navals-writing">no one else has</a>, not by doing what everyone around you is doing. The two best heuristics I know of for making this happen are to go after what is weird and what is old. When you start poking around weird/old things, you're going to run into a lot of mularkey, but this is actually a feature, not a bug - you get to practice evaluating sources and how they fit in with what else you know. If everything you encounter fits into a neat, coherent system without this work, you are missing or distorting large chunks of reality, because reality is messy. What do I mean by "weird"? Anything that would get a snooty look at a cocktail party is a good start - cryptids, UFOs, alternate versions of history, magic, conspiracies, and so forth. Am I saying you should <i>believe</i> all of this stuff? Of course not. The idea is to expose yourself to ways of thinking that are very different from what you'll usually encounter - sometimes, when used carefully, some of those ways of thinking are useful. And that leaves "old", this one is simpler - if it was written before you were born, chances are pretty good that it contains some ways of looking at the world that seem pretty alien to you, which again, is the point of the exercise.

  <li><a id="orgfd3d941"></a>Learn and Recognize the Three Economies<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfd3d941">
  <p>
  I encountered this model in John Michael Greer's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-wealth-of-nature-economics-as-if-surival-mattered-second-edition/9781945810572">The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</a>, which itself draws heavily on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">E.F. Schumacher</a>. The book was helpful for a variety of reasons, but the best bit was a mental model (see above). Greer breaks down "the economy" into three separate economies that work very differently: the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Economies. I'll start in the middle with the most familiar: the <i>Secondary Economy</i> is the economy of goods and services. I cut up meat to sell to the baker and use the proceeds to buy the products of the candlestick maker. Economics as a field is very good at analyzing the Secondary Economy, but tends not to think much about the <i>Primary Economy</i>, which is everything the natural world does to allow human economic activity to happen at all. When a farmer buys seed and a tractor and works his tuchus off cultivating and harvesting his crops, that's all Secondary Economy work. The fact that plants evolved little starch pods called grain, that the microbes in the soil allow plants to grow in it, that bees pollinate the plants, and that the sun shines down free energy for photosynthesis is all the Primary Economy. Lastly, we have the <i>Tertiary Economy</i>, which is the economy of financial instruments like money, loans, and stocks. Theoretically, everything in the Tertiary Economy is a representation of something in the Primary or Secondary Economy: I have a piece of paper called a "Title" that says I own a chunk of land, but the bank has a piece of paper saying they get the land if I don't pay back the loan they gave me to buy the title, and so on. So long as the Tertiary Economy remains pretty lightly linked with the Primary and Secondary economies, it's incredibly useful - using money to settle transactions and measure wealth has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">lots of benefits</a>, and other financial instruments help to start bigger, more complex businesses that can be valuable to everybody. Unfortunately, the Tertiary Economy has a tendency to become unmoored from underlying economic reality and to eat up more and more of the total share of economic activity in the form of speculative bubbles. The more emphasis on the Tertiary Economy, the more bubbles like this happen. Our current economy is something like 75% in the Tertiary by notional dollar value, which is definitely something to think about.

  <li><a id="orgfcecd7a"></a>Work Out Your Relationship to Meaning<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfcecd7a">
  <p>
  This is the bit of this post I had the hardest time writing. It's big, weighty, and feelings run very strong around it. So I'll just try to dive in. At one time or another, all of us grapple with questions like "what's the point of all this?" or "how do I know what to really care about?" Some of us find answers that work for us in the teachings of a religion or a philosophy. Others of us look to what science and reason can tell us. And some of us try to bring our eyes down to the here and now and focus on what's right in front of us and set aside such big, maybe unanswerable questions. Perhaps the most common response is to distract ourselves from the questions so that we don't have to think about them. Television, booze, sex, jobs, gadgets, jewelry - whatever our own vice might be, we find something that lets us ignore those questions for a while. This is a bad long-term strategy, for at some point, <i>something</i> will happen that will show you the distractions for what they are - empty, meaningless, a waste of your precious time and attention. Sometimes this can hit like a ton of bricks: maybe someone you love dies, or maybe the relationship you've built your life around ends, or you find out you've only got a few months to live. If you wait for these heavy moments to think seriously about meaning, you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls5j5iz2eA">gonna have a bad time</a>. Instead, start now. I won't tell you what traditions to explore, and I certainly won't tell you what conclusions to come to. This kind of thing is irreducibly personal, and what works for me is unlikely to work for you. If you're at a loss on where to start, there's an online book called <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a> that I think does a pretty good job of outlining many of the reasons this is a thorny problem, approaches that have historically been tried and some of the problems with them, and so forth. You could also do worse than to read some ancient philosophy. If there's a religious tradition that's familiar or appeals to you, you might see what it has to offer. Wherever you start, don't expect this to be a quick project, something you sort out over the summer and never think about again. Wrestling with meaning is a life-long challenge, but one that can make everything else far more worthwhile.

  <li><a id="org8ead2e9"></a>Meditate Discursively<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8ead2e9">
  <p>
  Lots of folks these days take seriously the idea of taking a bit of time every day to get your mind right, which is great. On the other hand, almost all of them practice forms of "mind-emptying" techniques that seek to still conscious thought, which is a bit less great. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with such techniques in and of themselves, but they have some little talked-about downsides. First off, very many folks find them tough to get started with or keep up. Secondly, even for folks who make a habit of it, many don't get that much out of them. Thirdly, and most seriously, a small number of people have very strong negative psychological reactions (most often if they jump straight into something like a week-long silent retreat with no prior training). Luckily, there's another method of meditation called <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/68294.html">"Discursive Meditation"</a>, which I learned from John Michael Greer. This method has a long history, tremendous benefits, and pretty much perfect safety.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here's how to do it: sit up straight in a chair, breathe deeply, and spend several minutes thinking about a specific theme of spiritual/philosophical significance. That's it! If you'd like more detail, check out the link above for a series of posts that lay it out step by step. You get all the good of training your attention not to wander, breathing deeply, and paying attention to your posture, while also giving your thinking mind a good workout as well. I've tried a wide variety of <a href="https://courses.liveanddare.com/limitless-life-meditation">meditation techniques</a>, and this one has been by far the most rewarding for me. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but think over giving it a shot. It's easy, safe, and works equally well whatever your spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) may be.

  <li><a id="org06495d8"></a>Express Romantic Interest First, Friendliness Later<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org06495d8">
  <p>
  Given the expectations and norms of our current culture, this one might be most useful for heterosexual males, but I hope it's helpful to whoever might need it. Many young folks, when they find themselves romantically interested in someone take an approach of "let's get to be friends, and then I'll ask her/him out later". This sounds reasonable, but is actually a terrible plan born of cowardice. Yes, I know, harsh, but that harshness comes from my own bitter experience of trying to follow this plan back in the day. Basically, asking someone out is scary, and we scramble to  mitigate that fear any way we can. It seems like asking someone out will be less scary if we know the other person already likes us as a friend. Plausible, but crap. Being friends is not the same as being lovers, they're different relationships with different dynamics and different needs. Of course, there is <i>some</i> overlap, but it's actually easier to go from "we went on a date and there wasn't any chemistry" to "so let's just be friends" than it is to go from "we feel comfortable together as friends" to "so do you want to risk ruining that with awkwardness by going on a date?" So, if there's someone you think you might want to date, ask them out instead of trying to be friends first.

  <li><a id="orgd7db206"></a>Have Kids If You Want Them<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd7db206">
  <p>
  So yes, kids aren't for everyone, and you definitely shouldn't have a kid if you aren't ready or don't really want one, but overall, kids are pretty great. I wanted to state this explicitly, because from the outside, it's easy to see what sucks about having kids: they take your time, they're expensive, they throw fits, they cover you in snot and get you sick, and so on. The thing is, from the outside, it's also harder to see what is great about having kids: watching a human gradually come online, seeing your own facial expressions mirrored back to you, having someone who feels emotions more intensely than you even know how to run up, throw their arms around you, and bury their face in your shoulder. There is absolutely nothing like it.

  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgfa01c2f"></a>Learn from the Stoics<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfa01c2f">
  <p>
  There's a lot of great stuff in ancient philosophy, but if I had to pick one thing that's most helpful, it would be the core insight of Stoicism: "you can't control what happens to you, but you <i>can</i> control how you react to it". Simple to state, hard to live. Someone cuts you off in traffic? You didn't make that happen, but you have full control over whether you get mad, how mad you get, and what you do because you're mad. Again, I know, easier said that done. And the Stoics acknowledged that you might not be able to stop that initial flare of anger from appearing, but <i>you are not your emotions</i>. They are something that happen to you, and you can choose to engage with them or distance yourself from them. Sometimes anger is useful, because it motivates you to right wrongs. Other times it just stresses you out for no reason. Learning to get inside your own cognitive processes like this is enormously helpful. Instead of being jerked around by whatever emotion happens to flare up due to circumstances, you can decide to steer your life based on whatever values you find truly important.

  <li><a id="org67a0258"></a>Turn Off Notifications, Feeds, and News<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org67a0258">
  <p>
  Most folks say that time is your most valuable resource, but I'd tweak that to say that <i>attention</i> is your most valuable resource. We've all had hours or days or weeks where we didn't do much and felt vaguely crappy afterwards. We've also all had experiences of intense, focused attention, maybe only for a few minutes, that have stuck with us as peak moments. Time may be the quantitative measure of your finitude in this existence, but attention is the qualitative. Where I'm going with all this high-flying philosophy is that you should be utterly ruthless in guarding your attention from anyone and anything that tries to grab it without your express, willed intent. Ever had a pleasant evening spoiled when you got an text from someone wanting you to deal with some problem for them? Ever been right in the middle of straightening out a complicated argument in your head when an email alert has popped up and you lose that almost-there insight? Ever been at dinner with a date, you're really getting into the conversation, and then they check their phone? Notifications destroy the quality of whatever they interrupt, even if you don't do anything else with them right away. It's even worse when the notifications try to further hijack your attention - taking you to a social media post that is at the top of a rabbit hole you go down for hours or to a news story that freaks you out and ruins your mood for a whole weekend. Notifications are evil. Turn as many of them off as you can possibly get away with. Put your attention where <i>you</i> want it to go, and keep it there for as long as <i>you</i> decide.

  <li><a id="orgdd941b6"></a>Spend Some Time Outside<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdd941b6">
  <p>
  This one really is this simple: every day if you can, but at least once a week, go spend some time sitting or walking outdoors. If you can get somewhere with plants and animals, go there. If not, consider moving somewhere less hellish, but in the meantime, sun or moon and sky will do just fine. Most of us spend most of our lives in large boxes looking at smaller, brighter boxes, focusing on an abstract world of words, images, and thoughts. As such, we have very little connection to the actual, physical world that keeps us alive. So, go outside. This shouldn't be some doleful chore (though, on some days in the summer in Texas, it can feel that way). Go feel the warm sun on your face, watch squirrels get frisky, check out good-looking guys or gals. Fifteen or twenty minutes is great if you can get it, but even just a handful of minutes can do wonders.

  <li><a id="org56929f3"></a>Don't "Follow Your Passion"<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org56929f3">
  <p>
  This is the core idea in Cal Newport's <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love-9781455509126/9781455509126">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. "Follow your passion" was a rallying cry for Baby Boomers who had followed the overly-conservative career advice of parents who lived through the Great Depression, and it was useful for getting folks used to the idea that maybe you shouldn't be miserable at your job if you can help it. Unfortunately, it was going too far to suggest that everyone has some deep, inborn passion that they just need to discover and their whole life will fall into place. Sure, some folks have these life-defining passions, but most of them figure that out pretty young. You ever met someone who can't help but draw, no matter what? That guy's got a passion, he doesn't need the advice to find it. Most of us don't have that. Instead, most of us <i>become</i> passionate about whatever we get <i>good at</i>. So, Newport recommends you find some skills that are both rare and valuable and then get good at them. Rare so that you're not a dime a dozen, and valuable so that other people will actually pay for it. Some examples: crafting ships in bottles is rare, but not so valuable. Being a decent, but not great, computer programmer is fairly valuable, but not that rare. So, if you want a challenging, meaningful career, find something hard to get good at that's in demand, and then get good at that. Once you do, you'll have more control over what you do, who you work for, and what you achieve. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org187b17e"></a>Learn a Craft<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org187b17e">
  <p>
  Learn how to make something with your hands - scarves, bread, motorcycle engines, whatever grabs you. If you don't know what you might like making, try a wide variety of crafts (remember Divergence and Convergence?). Pay attention to what seems interesting even when you're not good at it (for me, that's woodcarving). Then take some classes, watch some videos, find a club, or whatever works - learn the skills you need and then make the time to do it. Getting really good might take a lot of work, but you can get to "just fine" in many things with very little practice: for example, I bet you could go from "bread comes from a shelf in the store" to baking tasty loaves in 2 or 3 tries, tops. The goal here is not to become an artisan and quit your job to do glassblowing full time (though, if you can make that work, more power to you). The point is to concentrate deeply and engage with something outside of yourself in the real world. You'll find there's a big difference between imagining what it takes to turn water, flour, and yeast into dough versus feeling a sticky substance and smooshing it around until it feels right. Not only is it helpful to ground yourself like this, it is <i>hugely</i> enjoyable! If you've never "lost yourself" in something you cared about, then you are truly missing out. Of the most meaningful things in my life, almost all of them involved this kind of focused attention.

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4fa294c">
  <p>
  I learned this from the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-house-that-cleans-itself/9780736949873">The House that Cleans Itself</a>  by Mindy Starns Clark. If you have tried something multiple times with the best of intentions, but for some reason it won't stick,  "I'll do it again, but this time I'll just try harder" is most likely a losing strategy. Instead, find a way to make it easier to do the right thing. For example, mail used to pile up on the credenza by the door. So, my wife and I put a two-drawer inbox on the credenza and a recycling bin next to it. Now, it's easy to sort what's mine or hers, and any junk mail goes right in the recycling. Apparently, it was too hard to walk the 15 feet to the main recycling bin, but it's not too hard to drop it within arm's reach. Go figure. Seriously, sometimes the tweaks that make something doable will be downright embarrassing. You can apply this concept in lots of areas of your life: set up automatic savings, don't have junk food in the house, put your alarm where you have to get out of bed to turn it off, have charging cables everywhere you might need to charge your phone, and so forth. There <i>are</i> some things where the answer is training your willpower, but more often than you might think, you can find a way to make it easier to win.

  <li><a id="org837bfa6"></a>Fake It Till You Make It<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org837bfa6">
  <p>
  This advice has become much more widespread of late, but allow me to reiterate: you will not be good at something when you start. You get good at it by doing it. Humans are imitative animals, so if you want to be good at something, act as much like someone who is good at it as you can, and then keep at it. Eventually, the act will become the reality (likely far before you believe it). Don't put anybody at risk, of course, but it is almost always much safer to risk failing than you're afraid it is.

  <li><a id="org6ec9b1d"></a>Drink Water<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6ec9b1d">
  <p>
  If you're anything like me, you might have grown up drinking too much other liquid (like Dr. Pepper) and not enough water. Luckily, the Army beat this out of me, so I now take hydration very seriously. If you don't drink much water, you will be <i>shocked</i> at how much better you feel if you get enough. Here's how to do it: buy a 1 quart bottle that you will find convenient to carry around pretty much everywhere. Set a goal of drinking 2 of these a day (more if you do something that makes you sweat much). Set specific times/events by which to empty the bottle - for example "I'll drink one by lunch time and the next one by the end of the work day". If you find yourself getting light-headed, add a <i>tiny</i> pinch of salt to one or both bottles. If you are thirsty, add a 3rd or 4th bottle. If you drink any alcohol, consider going for that 3rd or 4th bottle just in case, and make sure you get some salt either in food or added to your water. Seriously, if you haven't been getting enough water, you have no idea how much it helps: headaches, tiredness, muscle growth, weight loss - all better with water.

  <li><a id="org3d4bff7"></a>Stretch<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d4bff7">
  <p>
  Most of us far more time sitting than our bodies are built for (see the point about How to Stand/Sit), which leaves us stiff. So get some stretching in your life. You can experiment, but here are a few good options to try out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AakYeM23sI">Sun Salutations</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_bY6REpIPE">Five Rites</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHnN0pBKM4n4x7wI90zg-Od0hSOKawwJ">Daily Dozen</a> , <a href="https://coursetolife.com/courses/gymnasticbodies-fundamentals-f1-pro-bundle/">Gymnastic Strength Training Daily Limber</a>. Whatever you pick, pay special attention to your back, since that's where a lot of the bad effects of sitting show up, but it's all linked up, so find a whole body routine. If you have a more intensive stretching practice, like Yoga or Gymnastic training or the like, then that's awesome, but even if you are otherwise a couch potato, do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes stretching every day.

  <li><a id="orga43d56a"></a>Stand (and Sit) Well<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga43d56a">
  <p>
  Okay, this one is best done by demonstration, but it's important enough that I didn't want to leave it out here. As folks who spend far too much time sitting, we are all bad at standing, which paradoxically also makes us bad at sitting. We stand and sit in ways that damage our skeletons and circulatory systems, so it'd be great to fix that. If you want to go <i>real</i> deep, check out <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deskbound-1-standing-up-to-a-sitting-world/9781628600582">Deskbound: Standing Up to a Sitting World</a> by Dr. Kelly Starrett, which is where I got this checklist for proper standing:
  </p>
  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li><i>Feet</i>: Plant your feet, toes straight forward (not out to the side or pointed inward) about hip-width apart.</li>
  <li><i>Knees</i>: Very slightly tense your muscles as if trying to turn your toes outward while keeping your heels planted, but don't let your toes actually move. You should feel this as a slight tension in your knees, which this movement stabilizes.</li>
  <li><i>Hips</i>: Tense your butt cheeks to do a humping motion with your hips, moving your tail bone down and forward. For a less crude metaphor, imagine that your hips are a cup and that you don't want to pour any liquid out the front. This stabilizes your hips.</li>
  <li><i>Lower Back</i>: Gently tense your abs, about 1/3 of full tension, pulling them back toward your spine</li>
  <li><i>Upper Back</i>: Rotate your arms in your shoulder sockets. To do this, with your hands at your sides, rotate them until your thumbs face forward.</li>
  <li><i>Head</i>: Move your head a bit forward and backward and feel for the spot where it's sitting right on top of the stable pillar you just made from the ground up.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  Congratulations, you are now standing the way your body was designed for! Keeping your body in this position every waking hour is a bit much, but I use this process as a handy check-in to "reset" when I notice myself slouching.
  </p>

  <p>
  To sit, just do steps 4-6, but you'll notice it's much harder. Your legs, and especially your hips, are doing a lot of the work of maintaining good posture when you stand, and when you sit, you basically don't have them to help.

  <b>By Gary Klein</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  The very same things are what excited me and disappointed me the most in this book. It presents intuition as a very no-nonsense ability that is critical for effective decision making, and gives advice on how to train to be better at it. Exactly what I wanted! On the other hand, it describes "intuition" as simply the ability to learn to detect patterns and apply past experiences to current situations, without consciously realizing  you've made that match - which is rather less romantic than I might hope for something as big and spooky as "intuition" to be. Once I set aside my childish disappointment, though, I found this book to be full of gems, and more importantly, to include detailed instructions on how to practice and train your team on these skills. I was expecting some help on decision making and ended up walking away with great techniques for leadership and creativity as well.

  </p>

  <p>
  While book clubs are great for getting everybody on the same page (har har), a <i>Bizarro</i> Book Club is a way to inject more diversity into your intellectual life. I’ve talked before about the importance of high quality <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#maximize_the_value_of_your_inputs">inputs</a> to your creativity, and this is my favorite new method for finding stuff that I would never have on my own. It combines the traditional social benefits of a book club with a much more exciting way of engaging with books, and it’s just as easy to do.  
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org918f424"></a>Everyday Book Clubs: the Good and the Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org918f424">
  <p>
  With your everyday book club, the best bit is that everyone gets to share a common experience. For many, book clubs are little more than an excuse for a regular get together where everyone has something to talk about. How many times have you heard folks admit they don’t talk much about the book and instead gossip the whole time? Don’t get me wrong - that sounds like a great time! Even when they are basically just low key parties, traditional book clubs are great for building and maintaining friendships. What’s more, if your friends really <i>do</i> care about the books, you can get some real depth from differing points of view on the same work. The discussion allows everyone to realize things they hadn’t and to leave with a better appreciation for what they got out of the book. So there’s a hell of a lot to recommend book clubs. 
  </p>

  <p>
  On the other hand, book clubs can have some shortcomings. For one thing, unless your group forms around shared tastes, someone is likely not to enjoy any given book picked by the group, which makes them less likely to have a good time or to bring worthwhile insights to the group. For another, any time you get folks together to talk about the same thing, they can all too easily fall prey to groupthink - somebody says something that sounds reasonable, and there’s no more discussion or debate. If you start a book club to broaden your mind, these weaknesses can bring on two different failures. First, if you form a group with shared tastes, you’re likely only going to read stuff that you were likely to find on your own, and your fellow members are more likely to think like you do, leading to groupthink. Secondly, if your group is made up of friends or neighbors, you’re more likely to run into books that you don’t like and to have a boring discussions about them. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgede1a7d"></a>My Answer: the Bizarro Book Club<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgede1a7d">
  <p>
  Altogether, these risks are not a big deal if your goal is to drink some wine and hang out. When it comes to reading, though, I am something of a crazy person. I want more from my recurring book-focused events than booze and chit chat. So I had an idea: create a book club to <i>my</i> specifications, and rope my friends into it. Drawn by the innocuous name of “book club”, little would they realize how cunningly I had led them into my selfish trap. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Here’s what I came up with: gather my most interesting reader friends, with rather different tastes, and each read a <i>different</i> book. Then, share what we got out of the book and discuss. I know these folks well enough to know they are careful readers and the ways our views differ, so their summaries are both high quality and reliable. When I discuss my own book, they make connections to other works that I’ve never heard of. Even better, the books they bring are those I <i>never</i> would have heard of on my own. Imagine if you could go on Goodreads and get a summary of a book that was guaranteed to be interesting, useful, and relevant to <i>you</i> - what a deal! Or if you whenever you made a note while reading, a little link appeared to a something that you (and the author) had never heard of before? This “Bizarro Book Club” was a way to hit the sweet spot between exposure to new thoughts and enough context for those thoughts to be meaningful.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org964909e"></a>Your Challenge: Try It Out<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org964909e">
  <p>
  So, my challenge to you: try out a Bizarro Book Club for yourself! 
  </p>

  <p>
  Here are the details on how to make one work:
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>Find at least two friends who love to read (preferably with varied tastes)</li>
  <li>Set up a regular get together, every month or so, that works for most of the group most of the time (we’re all over the country, so we use Google Hangouts, and Calendly)</li>
  <li>Tell everybody to come ready to talk about a different book (they can share what they’re planning to avoid overlap and get excited)</li>
  <li>If at least two people show up, that’s a quorum (try to make sure <i>something</i> happens every time you’re scheduled - that kind of consistency is important to keep something like this going)</li>
  <li>Talk about your books! (Maybe set a time limit for each person/book to get to everybody)</li>
  <li>If anyone gets so excited by a book discussed that they want to read it too, that’s okay, but they have to bring at least one new insight</li>
  <li>BONUS: To be your group’s hero, take notes to share (especially appreciated by those who couldn’t make it)</li>
  <li>DOUBLE DARE BONUS: Allow members to dare each other to read specific books (basically each member gives someone else a homework assignment)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  We’ve met a few times so far, and it has worked beautifully - even better than I could have hoped for. I’ve learned so much new stuff and walked away with deeper insights and connections for my own books. Everybody else has had the same reaction. It gladdens my heart that it has exceeded all of my high expectations, and I can’t wait to keep making it even better. If you love to read, do yourself a favor and give this a shot, you won’t be disappointed.

  <b>By Alain de Botton</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  This book provides a great overview of the tradition of Western philosophy. Besides providing useful summaries of some of the major thinkers and what their philosophy can do for you in your life, it shows the the connecting threads between thinkers that might seem totally unrelated at first glance. Each chapter gives a brief thumbnail of the biography and thinking of a major philosopher, which is great, but what's really useful about this book is that every chapter addresses a specific concern that everyone faces - such as unpopularity, money, and frustration. Alain's style is warm and gentle, with a hint of detached humor that makes for enjoyable reading. If you've ever thought "I wish I knew more about philosophy", this is the place to start.

  Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my "operating manuals" for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality.

  <b>By Julia Cameron</b>

  <p>
  I have to admit that if I picked this book up sight unseen and flipped through it, I would likely have put it back on the shelf - it has a lot of markers for being a bit too "woo woo" or "touchy feely" for my usual tastes. Fortunately, it came highly recommended by a bunch of well-grounded people that I respect, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. The basic premise is that everyone can be creative, but most of us have developed the idea that we're not allowed to or have otherwise blocked our access to our creative selves. To counteract this, it provides a twelve week guided program to lead to greater creativity. I'm not very far into the program, but already I am seeing the benefit of its two core habits: <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Morning Pages</a> and <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/">Artist Dates</a>. If you are already convinced that you could be more creative with some help and don't need as much back up, consider going straight to the workbook.

  </p>

  <p>
  Man oh man am I loving this book. It puts out a comprehensive record of thinking about the concept of strategy in western thought from the Bible and Homer all the way to modern theorists. Along the way, Freedman provides analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various formulations and their applications. Despite what might turn into a dry, intellectual subject, the book is quite clear and readable, moving briskly through trends and eras of thought. For me, it's greatest value is highlighting the connections and influences between figures as disparate as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and John Boyd. I suspect that I will be coming back to my notes on this and its bibliography for years to come.

  <b>By Tim Ferriss</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  Besides being a phenomenal "learn to cook from nothing" cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn anything. Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn't done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it's rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in The 4 Hour Workweek and The 4 Hour Body, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other "how to learn" frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you're already a master cook, check this book out for it's advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.

  </p>

  <p>
  I mentioned this book in my post on <a href="#storytelling_part_5-resources_for_digging_deeper">Storytelling Resources</a>, but I thought it deserved its own call out. An incredibly slim book, you can read and understand it in an evening, but will likely return to it again and again. This book clearly lays out the rules of modern American usage and style, favoring concise, vigorous prose. Even if you enjoy waxing more eloquent, this provides a great starting place from which to depart. It's also admirably organized, with a detailed table of contents and clear headings for the rules it propounds, making it ideal as a reference work (which it will be for the vast majority of its usefulness, since it will only take an hour or two to read it the first time). If you write at all for your living or for pleasure, you should have this book in easy reach at all times.

  <p>
  <b>By Walter Isaacson</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  I have long irrationally avoided biographies, despite encountering a few excellent ones like Team of Rivals, so I decided I needed to remedy that to read one about a personal hero of mine. Leonardo stands as the archetypal "Renaissance Man", with achievements in art, architecture, science and more all under his belt. His brilliant and beautiful notebooks make any journaler feel inadequate. And yet, one of the most reassuring parts of this book is that it seems unlikely that Leonardo was as set apart intellectually as an Einstein or a Newton, nor as naturally artistically gifted as a Michaelangelo. Instead, Leonardo learned everything through a combination of insatiable curiosity and determined attention and focus. He was also able to turn his varied interests and propensity for abandoning projects into a firm set of multidisciplinary knowledge that spurred creative insight across fields. So he's something of a role model for those of us who worry we didn't win the genetic lottery or feel a lack of focus. This book is fantastic and humanizing while still highlighting the key takeaways from his life that we can enjoy in our own.

  <p>
  I’ve done my best to share a fantastic beginner’s guide to storytelling with this series, but there is a lot of depth to all of the topics that I’ve touched on. Below, I provide my recommendations on resources for digging into Story Structure, Effective Practice, Public Speaking, Oral Storytelling, Writing, and Visual Storytelling. In each section, I’ve provided a handful of my favorite “how to” resources, whether books, blogs, videos, or courses along with a section of illustrative examples applying the lessons you’ll learn from the how to books. These lists are by no means exhaustive, and if I’ve missed any of your favorite works on storytelling, please let me know, as I am always hungry for new insights on the topic.

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd451c88">
  <p>
  The Story Grid by Shawn Coyne
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to dive deep into structure and how to put together a story that works, you could do a lot worse than to read The Story Grid. Shawn Coyne takes an editor’s approach to figuring out the nuts and bolts of what “works” in a story or not. The book focuses mostly on fiction, but he has regular blog posts and further material at the website that apply it to all sorts of other examples.
  </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgc799aee"></a>The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc799aee">
  <p>
  I dare you to time how long you can read about story structure without Joseph Campbell coming up. This book is where he lays out the fundamental structure shared by almost every enduring mythological tale across the world. Something about this sort of story speaks to the fundamental human experience, and has been for at least thousands of years. If you’ve ever heard of a “hero’s journey” or the “monomyth”, this book is where that comes from. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org9a19e49"></a>Save the Cat by Blake Snyder<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9a19e49">
  <p>
  Blake Snyder devotes his book to the end-to-end process of writing a screenplay, and so contains a lot of material not directly related to structure, but it has a rock-solid basic approach to thinking about structure, and even better, hands-on details about how to actually do that. My personal favorite thing from the book is “The Board” - a board you put up on the wall that shows the breakdown into acts, on which you place index cards for each scene, and for each scene you track the change in emotional charge and what the conflict is. The Story Grid covers a lot of the same ground, but they are useful to compare and cherry pick from.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org794c74e"></a>On the Shapes of Stories by Kurt Vonnegut<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org794c74e">
  <p>
  This delightful (and short) video shares both Vonnegut’s clear understanding of story structure as well as his wit. I recommend watching it a few times: the first time to enjoy it as an entertaining presentation, and then again to realize “oh wait, there’s actually something there.”
  </p>
  </div>

  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga540b2f"></a>See Others Do It Well<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga540b2f">
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgbc3f2a0"></a>Mythology by Edith Hamilton<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgbc3f2a0">
  <p>
  If you want to see the basic myths that Campbell was talking about, there are fewer better presentations than Edith Hamilton’s collection of Greek myths. Academically rigorous but easy to read, this is the “one book” on classical mythology. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org674e3ce"></a>Tootsie<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org674e3ce">
  <p>
  Screenwriting classes love to use Tootsie as an example, because it’s just a good, solid story with a structure that works. Every scene moves the story forward, every scene has a shift in emotional charge, every scene has conflict, and the character grows exactly the way we want to see him do so.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga42494b"></a>A Christmas Story<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga42494b">
  <p>
  I am especially tickled to point to this example because it is framed as a narrator telling a story - aren’t we all so meta. Every anecdote in the seemingly scattered remembrances of the narrator actually contributes to the overall story, following that Red Rider BB gun. It’s extremely tight and on point the whole time, which helps to explain why people happily re-watch every year.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orge1a3ffb"></a>Pulp Fiction<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge1a3ffb">
  <p>
  Another favorite of film nerds, Pulp Fiction serves as a great example of how structure does not equal chronology. Tartantino chooses to show us scenes based on what he wants us to know about the character at the time, which means that he can’t rely on normal causality to carry the plot along if he gets the sequencing wrong. We’re left with a movie where we buy into the plight of a lot of pretty bad dudes and enjoy struggling along with them.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgd38ec1e"></a>The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd38ec1e">
  <p>
  Okay, this one is by the far the nerdiest thing I’m recommending, but hear me out. Each one of these novels works as a tightly structured hard boiled detective story - all the obligatory scenes and genre conventions are there in ways that are both satisfyingly familiar and intriguingly new. At the same time, each book builds the overall character arc of its titular protagonist, Harry Dresden (spoiler alert) and calls back to previous novels in both expected and unexpected ways. The quality certainly improves over the course of the series, but even the first few books are enjoyable stand alone detective stories.

  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc0846e3">
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org6230d28"></a>The 4-Hour Chef by Tim Ferriss<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6230d28">
  <p>
  What does cooking have to do with Storytelling? Not much, but the first section of this book breaks down Tim’s recipe for deconstructing a new skill to learn and how to maximize the value of your practice. I like to think I’ve done a lot of the deconstructing and sequencing work for you on Storytelling with this series, but it’s a meta-skill worth learning. As an added bonus, if you don’t already know how to cook, this is the best learn-to-cook cookbook ever written.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org8673013"></a>The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8673013">
  <p>
  Short and to the point, Coyle distills the lessons he has learned from neuroscientists, coaches, and performers for building world-class talent into short tips. The book is helpfully organized into sections focused on getting started, building skills effectively, and maintaining motivation when it gets hard. Intended as a quick reference to be carried around and looked at again and again, this book won’t convince you that deliberate practice is the way to get great if you don’t already believe it, but it will help you immensely in actually doing the work.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org35f0145"></a>The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org35f0145">
  <p>
  Josh Waitzkin is terrifyingly brilliant and has an amazing ability to learn new fields to highest levels of mastery. His book is one of my personal operating manuals, and every time I return to it, I realize that I didn’t understand it as well as I thought before. His section on “Making Smaller Circles” is especially relevant for how to approach practice once you’ve already identified the skill or had the basic insight you need to work on.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org85cf02a"></a>Scott Young’s Blog<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org85cf02a">
  <p>
  Scott is a fantastic resource on all things learning related, and he relentlessly looks for ways to make his learning more effective. You’ll see him come up again below in the examples section, but there’s an absolute wealth of free material on his blog. I especially recommend his advice on setting up your own ultralearning project if you want to really improve your storytelling.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org83ab694"></a>Rapid Learner Course<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org83ab694">
  <p>
  Speaking of Scott Young, he has very thoughtfully put together all of his best material and experience on effectively learning things as quickly as possible into this online course. I have found it extremely effective in learning challenging material quickly on everything from languages through improving my coaching skills.
  </p>
  </div>

  <li><a id="org0cc2c65"></a>See Others Do It Well<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0cc2c65">
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org6e97caf"></a>Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6e97caf">
  <p>
  While there are lots of works on improving your memory and even on memory competition, I chose to highlight Joshua Foer’s because it focuses on his own journey going from having no idea such as a thing as “mental athletics” existed to himself competing and succeeding as one. It provides a really impressive example of what you can achieve by learning the right way to practice and following through.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org6829894"></a>Scott Young’s Ultralearning Projects<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6829894">
  <p>
  If you aren’t sure that Scott Young knows what he’s talking about when it comes to learning things well quickly, check out his ultralearning projects. This dude completed the equivalent of an MIT undergrad in Computer Science in one year. For the most visually impressive example, check out his drawing project.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgaf78d9d"></a>The King’s Speech<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgaf78d9d">
  <p>
  Dramatized, of course, but the true story of someone with some pretty serious challenges to telling stories working his butt off to get it right. Most of us don’t have quite as high stakes as King George VI declaring war on Germany, but we all have challenges to overcome and opportunities to tell an important story.

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org2c3eeef"></a>Show and Tell by Dan Roam<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2c3eeef">
  <p>
  We’ve talked about this book before, but it is the best “one stop shop” on how to go from zero to giving great presentations I’ve seen. It discusses, structure, practice, and delivery in ways that will be familiar to you from this series, and has a great recommended reading list at the end, with some of the same titles you’ll see here. I especially appreciate its emphasis on tying together the spoken message and whatever visuals you are presenting, and how they can reinforce each other to create a stronger whole.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga8edf69"></a>Dale Carnegie Course<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga8edf69">
  <p>
  There are a lot of different courses offered by Dale Carnegie Training these days, some focused more specifically on public speaking than others, but the underlying principle for all of them is to better understand and empathize with other people as human beings. I have not taken one of their courses yet, but I’ve heard nothing but good things and its on my list.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org47d3d46"></a>Toastmasters<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org47d3d46">
  <p>
  Another recommendation that I have to provide on the strength of what I’ve heard, this is the best known way to make sure you get a lot more chances to speak in public and learn by doing. They have clubs all over the world and create a supportive environment for people to build their skills as a speaker and get meaningful feedback. If you don’t have a job that requires a lot of presentations (or if you do and are hungry for even more), this is a great way to get your reps in.

  <li><a id="orga0c030a"></a>Mindtools Article<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga0c030a">
  <p>
  This article provides a nice overview of how to approach improving your public speaking, and goes into more specifics than we’ve covered in this general series on storytelling. The thing I like the most about it are the links - each section provides a basic overview, but there are a lot of links to dive deeper on specific topics as needed. That’s not all - the article linked is part of a series on giving presentations, which itself is part of a series on Communication skills. Mindtools has a pretty smart nesting and linking of related skills and makes a great resource for a motivated learner.

  <li><a id="org1bd5af0"></a>Your body language may shape who you are - Amy Cuddy<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1bd5af0">
  <p>
  Otherwise known as “Fake it ’til you become it, this is one of my favorite TED talks of all time, and is applicable to much more than just public speaking. It talks about the feedback loop created by our body language, the mental states they create, and what we believe about ourselves. Does public speaking terrify you? If so, the cure is to adopt the posture and body language of someone triumphant and powerful to counteract your natural scared body language. It sounds nuts, but it works.

  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org77a4d18"></a>Why we do what we  do by Tony Robbins<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org77a4d18">
  <p>
  Tony Robbins is one of the most dynamic and engaging public speakers I’ve ever seen. If you want to see even more of him doing his thing, check out his outstanding Netflix documentary I Am Not Your Guru.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgd1120ab"></a>“Your elusive creative genius” by Elizabeth Gilbert<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd1120ab">
  <p>
  I snuck this one in for some bonus storytelling advice along with watching someone deliver an effective speech. Gilbert talks about the psychology necessary to do the actual work of writing (or anything else creative). Pairs extremely well with The War of Art.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org5a196b2"></a>"This is Water" by David Foster Wallace<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5a196b2">
  <p>
  Not quite as energetic or dynamic as the previous two, pay attention as you listen to this one to the more writerly approach Wallace takes with his structure, self-referential commentary, and asking the audience to get a bit meta. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org53f62e2"></a>“We Shall Fight Them on the Beaches” by Winston Churchill<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org53f62e2">
  <p>
  One of the most famous speeches of all time. Notice how different the cadence and emphasis were than a modern politician would use. This guy knew he had your attention for the next 12 minutes, and he made sure to convey the gravitas the occasion demanded. I wouldn’t recommend that you try to copy Churchill’s style today, but take a look at the differences in assumptions about delivery and style between then and now, and ask yourself if you really want to stick with yours.

  <li><a id="org9810ab2"></a>The Art of Storytelling: From Parents to Professionals<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org9810ab2">
  <p>
  This course focuses on the art of standing in front of people and telling them a story with your voice and goes into a lot of great nuts and bolts details. It also includes material on things like structure and characterization and so on, but what it is has that you can’t get from other sources is a lot of specific advice that doesn’t apply to writing or movie making or drawing comics and may or may not apply to large audience public speaking. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org3be7ca0"></a>How to Talk to Anybody<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3be7ca0">
  <p>
  Another course on general communication and social skills, this includes some very practical and easy to follow advice on telling stories, because stories are an essential part of good interpersonal skills. My favorite piece of advice: keep a story “toolbox” of ready-to-go stories you’ve practiced and tweaked and pull them out whenever it’s appropriate. Sounds obvious, but have you actually done it?
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org96eaf92"></a>Storytelling: Art and Technique by Ellin Greene and Janice M. Del Negro<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org96eaf92">
  <p>
  A classic textbook on oral storytelling as practiced in America. I have not read this yet, but it seems to be the definitive reference work on the subject and is cited all over the place.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org20217d4"></a>Second City Improv Program<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org20217d4">
  <p>
  The famous Chicago-based group invented comedy improv as we know it, and has codified how to succeed when improvising. If you don’t happen to live in Chicago, there are improv groups just about everywhere. What does improv have to do with storytelling? It gets you used to finding relevant connections with other people and spinning them into a story, and also teaches you to read what’s working for your audience and what’s not. Plus, you’ll bomb a few times, which feels terrible, but then you keep going and you realize it’s not a big deal, which is crucial to build the confidence to tell entertaining stories with enough verve.

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org651bc5f"></a>Mike Birbiglia - What I Should Have Said Was Nothing<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org651bc5f">
  <p>
  My friend recently pointed me in Birbiglia’s direction as a great example of a comedian who builds his humor through storytelling rather than relying as much on specific jokes. Patton Oswalt is another favorite of mine. I especially like to pay attention to what stand up comedians do because the most common reason we’re telling a story in our personal lives is to entertain people and make them laugh - so who better to check out than people that get paid to do it?
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgfb9db7c"></a>Hardcore History by Dan Carlin<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgfb9db7c">
  <p>
  Podcasts are another favorite form of verbal storytelling for me, because they have to be good enough to work without visuals of any kind. Carlin does a remarkable job of calling up vivid images in your mind of the events he describes and invites you to empathize with the actual lived experience of the human beings that were there. Really good stuff, but be forewarned: most episodes are better named “audiobooks” and run several hours long. Perfect for long drives, not so great for bite sized enjoyment.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org813c244"></a>Lore by Aaron Mahnke<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org813c244">
  <p>
  My wife turned me on to this one, where Mahnke recounts historically attested tales of weird and creepy stuff. Most of the stories are not (and cannot be) verified as actually happening, but all of them are things that people at least said actually happened - you know, folklore. Even though Mahnke’s cadence includes the occasional hilariously inexplicable pause, he effectively holds your interest and builds tension to creepy climax of each episode. Unlike Hardcore History, these are usually just the right length for listening while doing chores or making a commute.

  <li><a id="orgb319def"></a>The Elements of Style by William Strunk and E.B. White<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb319def">
  <p>
  This one is the definitive guide to what American authors mean when they say “good writing”. It’s quite brief at a whole 85 pages, and contains advice on everything from comma usage to word choice. Anyone who has ever told you to get rid of unnecessary words, use the active voice, and to prefer the plainest way of saying something possible was speaking in the tradition of Strunk. It’s usefully organized as topical chapters subdivided into brief discussion of pithy principles - as an information architecture nerd, I find that delightful.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org740f9b3"></a>On Writing by Stephen King<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org740f9b3">
  <p>
  The classic work by one of the most popular and successful authors of all time, King knows a thing or two about telling stories via the printed word. Like his fiction, the prose is direct, clear, and keeps up a good clip. My one complaint is that it’s structure as a collection of disconnected memories leaves something to be desired in the referencing things later department - but perhaps that’s the point, you have to digest it to get the good stuff out of it
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org3c03bea"></a>Words that Work by Frank Luntz<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3c03bea">
  <p>
  A wonderfully pragmatic book that focuses on the importance of how you say it when most of are laser focused on what it is we want to say. While the thrust of the book is on persuasion, as Luntz has worked as a marketer and political speechwriter, the advice to choose your words based on the impact they will have on your audience applies to anything that relies on words. I find it especially useful to compare and contrast with The Elements of Style, which is predominantly focused on aesthetics rather than persuasion.

  <li><a id="org85c93e3"></a>Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t by Steven Pressfield<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org85c93e3">
  <p>
  In this brief work, Pressfield takes the lessons he’s learned writing in different fields - advertising, screenplays, fiction, non-fiction, and self help - and how he applies them across the board. The title reveals the most important lesson: people are busy and don’t want to read anything unless there’s a reason it is compellingly interesting to them - which means you need to develop some serious empathy to get anywhere as a writer. Funny how that keeps popping up about storytelling, right?
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga544b47"></a>Steven Pressfield’s Blog<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga544b47">
  <p>
  I’ve referenced Pressfield several times in this series, because I so much enjoy his writing on writing. His blog provides more frequent and bite size doses of what you get in his books. If you aren’t sold on War of Art or Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t from my description, pop over to his blog for “Writing Wednesdays” to get a good feel for tone, style, and content.

  <li><a id="org67909b5"></a>Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org67909b5">
  <p>
  This is a much more “literary” book than I usually read and enjoy, but it’s dream-like descriptions of bizarre cities are extremely vivid and compelling. There’s a “twist” at the end that most people know before they come to the book, but honestly, I just enjoyed it for imagining the impossible cities as real fantastic places, and enjoying the near-poetic language used to bring them to life.

  <li><a id="orgd2c539f"></a>Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd2c539f">
  <p>
  Most of my examples here of good writing are fiction, because most non-fiction writers must split their effort between getting good at writing and getting good at whatever they’re writing about, whereas fiction authors can focus almost entirely on the craft of making good prose. Steven Johnson’s early works show the signs of that division of labor - Emergence covers absolutely fascinating material and makes extremely valuable connections, but it gets a big clunky to follow at times. His more recent works, however, expertly weave together the disparate facts and insights he shares with you. Honestly, I could have picked from several books, but I like Where Good Ideas Come From the best.

  <li><a id="orgdbee4e7"></a>Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdbee4e7">
  <p>
  Steven Pressfield may not be a Proust or a Hemingway, but I enjoy his books a lot more. Gates of Fire does a great job of describing action in an exciting way while simultaneously exploring the nature of fear, bravery, and loyalty. Required reading at most American military academies and incredibly popular in the special operations community, this is one of the best written books on leadership you can pick up.

  <li><a id="org1871ff8"></a>Reamde by Neal Stephenson<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1871ff8">
  <p>
  Again, most folks would not point to Neal Stephenson as a prose stylist, but this book is the perfect example of nailing  the execution of a techno-political thriller. As I’ve mentioned before, Stephenson is one of my favorite authors, and I’ve read all of his books, so this one especially stood out by being different in style to his others. The long, information-rich digressions that I so love from Snow Crash and The Baroque Cycle are completely missing here, because this book is all about creating tension and then ratcheting it up relentlessly. Other than Breaking Bad, I have never seen such an expert display of continually increasing stakes: imagine an infinite sequence of falling out of frying pans into fires into frying pans and so on.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc2270ee">
  <p>
  For those of you not familiar with comics, Will Eisner is the guy after whom their biggest award is named - he started writing comics in New York in the 30’s when his high school buddy Bob Kane (creator of Batman) suggested he give it a go, coined the term “graphic novel”, and worked hard to argue and prove that comics could tell  serious stories and were a legitimate literary form. This book takes what he learned from his decades of experience creating and teaching sequential art and distills it into a guide to make sure the visuals are always in service to the story - and not the other way around. Beautifully illustrated (duh) and cogently written, this book is useful for anyone who needs to convey messages with a combination of words and images, not just artists and flimmakers.

  <li><a id="org22d542c"></a>Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org22d542c">
  <p>
  This is another meta-work: a comic book about comic books. Why am I harping on comics so much here? Well besides being a big nerd and enjoying them quite a lot, they provide an excellent comparison point to writing (nothing but words) and movies (moving pictures combined with spoken words) that allows examination of what is the same and what is different - and McCloud does exactly that. The central conceptual point of the work is that comic readers are active participants in the creation of the story, because they have to fill in the gaps between every frame. Writers and filmmakers can pull off that trick if they try, but with comics it is absolutely essential and pervasive. That creates a medium with a unique form of engagement worth exploring.

  <li><a id="org6fbd98c"></a>Genndy Tartakovsky - Reading the Action<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6fbd98c">
  <p>
  I found this video when I was looking for examples of composition and pacing done well for the post on Delivery and was immediately hooked. As my previous posts have made no effort to hide, I’m a big fan of everything Genndy Tartakovsky does, and this explained how he does it with remarkable clarity and great examples. I’ve since watched several episodes of Samurai Jack and keep noticing the three techniques identified here. As with comics, I like analyses of animation as a way of learning about film, because the lack of human actors and overt stylization allows you to focus on form and composition and such like very purely.

  <li><a id="org6e563ac"></a>The Doodle Revolution by Sunni Brown<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6e563ac">
  <p>
  While this book is not about storytelling exactly, it is about learning to understand and use “visual language”, which can greatly improve communication and understanding, particularly of abstract concepts. This book addresses many of the challenges with learning and using visual language, from people not even stopping to consider it all the way to insecurity over artistic or creative ability hindering visual output. It provides a lot of very concrete guidance on how and when to use visual language in business and personal settings, all without being good at art. Pairs extremely well with Show and Tell above and Gamestorming.

  <p>
  This quick little video does an excellent job of teaching you something important in a way that is far more memorable and effective than a simple lecture or written chapter. RSA Animate provides the live-drawn whiteboard style graphics to Dan Pink’s narration, and the overall combination of diagrammatic pictures and voice over creates something that will stick with you for years.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org05bf235">
  <p>
  I love Samurai Jack, but these shorts combine Tartakovsky’s stylistic elements described in the video linked above with my lifelong love of Star Wars. Taken as a whole, I “joke” that these are my favorite prequel. Originally aired as 3 minute (later expanded to 15 minute) shorts between programs on Cartoon Network, these are incredibly tight little self contained stories that nonetheless build into an overall picture of the Clone War, seamlessly linking the end of Attack of the Clones with the beginning of The Revenge of the Sith. Even if you are not a fan of Star Wars, check out the expert use of environments, composition, and carefully choreographed fight scenes.

  <li><a id="org2a21a8f"></a>300 by Frank Miller<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2a21a8f">
  <p>
  As the only Zack Snyder film I completely enjoy, I give full credit to Frank Miller for the original, which Snyder very directly adapted. Yes, this is the second time Thermopylae has come up in the examples here, but that is to be expected from a classicist infantryman. The graphic novel showcases Miller’s high-contrast style and impressive composition, but also uses size and placement of frames/panels to expertly pull you through the story. It is also just as much a story about storytelling as less gory titles like The Sandman - about the story Western Europe tells itself about its past, the stories a culture tells itself about its values, and the stories we tell ourselves to link our past with our present.

  <li><a id="orgb09cf9b"></a>Kwaidan - Directed by Masaki Kobayashi<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb09cf9b">
  <p>
  This movie is visually stunning. It came out in 1964 and I first saw it in 2017, and more than 50 years later, it still looks fantastic.  Not “good for its time” but “good for all movies ever made” in a way that is unfortunately rare. It treats us to not one, but four separate expertly told traditional Japanese ghost stories. It’s not an especially scary movie, but it is riveting and beautiful. I recommend it as an example of visual storytelling because for those of us who are American, it removes familiar cultural and artistic conventions and stands on the strength of its craft as a film alone.

  <b>By Will Eisner</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  Written by a giant of the sequential art field, this book covers the insights from decades of creating and teaching about the use of comics to tell stories. Eisner defends and establishes the usefulness and seriousness of the form as a literary medium, capable of addressing themes and issues that matter. The central tenet of the book is that the visuals must be shaped by the needs of the story and not the other way around - otherwise you get lured into meaningless set pieces that serve no purpose but to show off something that looks good. It covers a lot of the same ground as the other works we've discussed on Storytelling, but does so with beautiful illustrations (duh) and a very different focus than works addressed primarily to crafters of prose.

  Tim Ferriss recommended this book for writers of all kinds, despite its focus on screenwriting. I came to it in order to get a variety of perspectives on storytelling (speaking, writing fiction, writing screenplays, and so forth). Despite the fact that I often watch movies and think "I could have written something better than that!", I have no particular ambition to become a screenwriter, but I have nonetheless found this little book quite helpful. It's advice to get really clear about what your story is about applies across the board, and I appreciate its brass tacks focus on the fact that for anybody to ever experience your fantastic art, you have to sell it, which means people have to want to buy it. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a quick, fun read on how to write punchy things that get people's attention.

  We've talked before about War of Art and it's discussion of Resistance, the force within us that stops us from creating and achieving what we might. Well, Turning Pro is Pressfield's "how to" on overcoming that force, and it mostly comes down to doggedly showing up to do the work every day, regardless of how inspired you're feeling. While I find War of Art more inspirational overall, this work is a great companion that gives you concrete steps of what to do when you commit to following the advice in WoA.

  <p>
  This book has been on my list for a long time, but I only just now got around to reading it, and man was I missing out! It breaks down the mysterious art of writing a story that "works" into comprehensible and testable steps. That's what I think is most remarkable about this book: not that it tells you the components of a story that works (we've been getting that since Aristotle), but that it gives you tools to tighten up the feedback loop on your stories - you can evaluate your success or failure and make adjustments using these tools. You still have to put in the work and get inspired by the Muse, but all of the guesswork is removed. It has a really strong emphasis on writing fiction, but the lessons are applicable to any sort of storytelling.

  I've been using the approach outlined in this book for years now, thanks to some fantastic mentors at work, but I only just got around to reading it. I don't know what took me so long to get to it - it was great, and it only took me a little over two hours to read even taking a lot of notes. The basic premise of the book is that you should tell the truth, you should tell it as a story, and you should present the story with pictures as much as possible. It goes into more detail on how to make all of that happen of course, but if you're only ever going to read one book on how tell a story that people will care about, read this one. The four presentation Storylines (Presentation Underlying Message Architectures, or PUMAs) are worth the price of admission alone.

  <p>
  This book identifies six types of "simple rules" that offer enough guidance to be useful but enough flexibility to respond to complexity. More exciting than that, it walks through how to create your own simple rules for work and life. Unless you're my kind of geek, it's not the sexiest topic in the world, but for one thing, it's shockingly useful, and for another, the authors use a conversational tone that makes for pleasant reading. Whether you're looking to make better decisions about investing, dating, or your company's strategy, this book has you covered.

  <p>
  I worry a bit that this is becoming the Steven Johnson fan club, but I am really enjoying his books recently. This one takes a look at history through the lens of what was made possible through the development of some key technologies, like glass and sanitation. Besides providing a plethora of fun trivia, like the fact that in the mid nineteenth century it was more practical to raise the entire city 10 feet than to tunnel under it to install a sewer system, or that chlorinating water reduced infant mortality by ~40%, the book provides a fascinating reframe of how we normally process history. Instead of looking at decisions made by individuals or trends embodied in governments and cultures, it asks "what couldn't have happened without this technology that did happen after it was invented?" Maybe not as immediately useful as Where Good Ideas Come From, but it's possibly a more approachable and enjoyable introduction to Johnson's style. Definitely check it out.

  <b>By Carl Gustav Jung, translated by H.F.C. Hull</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  If you're like me, you probably have a vague idea of Jung from high school English classes, and something about archetypes. Maybe you heard he was an important influence on Lucas when he made Star Wars. If you studied psychology, you may have gotten a brief discussion about how he was important psychologist for a while, but we've moved past his outdated theories. Well, I'm here to tell you that Jung is both weirder and smarter than you probably think, and that makes it worth reading his stuff for yourself. Synchronicity is a perfect introduction because it is short and enjoyably mind-bending. Jung basically argues that disparate events can be meaningfully linked in ways besides causality. If nothing else, it is an enjoyable mental exercise to wrestle with such an alien concept, and who knows, you might gain a richer understanding of your own experience of the world.

  I just couldn't resist a book about where the voice in your head comes from when today's post is about imagining other people's voices. I have no idea at how well regarded this book is currently as a credible explanation of where consciousness came from, but it makes a fantastic tool for imagining <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4893">what if the world really were that way? What would it mean?</a> The book argues that "consciousness" - an almost unending voice in your head that narrates your thoughts and what's going on and is perceived as "yourself" is actually a rather recent phenomenon. Jaynes says that the Old Testament documents a culture going through the transition, and that you see similar evidence in Mesopotamian history as well. There's nothing immediately practical here, but it's enjoyably mind-blowing. Plus, season one of Westworld will make a lot more sense, so there's also that.

  This is our last installment in the current series on creativity, but don't expect it to be the last you hear about creativity in this space.

  As will surprise no one, I read a lot of books, so today's list is heavy on books. Here are some of my favorites and my thoughts on them. I've divided them up into categories based on what part of the creative process they'll help out the most with.
  </p>
  </div>

  <p>
  These books focus on the higher level questions associated with creativity: what problems do you apply your creative process to? what habits do you cultivate for improved creativity in the long term? what conceptual models do you bring to your efforts?
  </p>

  <p>
  I've mentioned this book before as one of my <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life">Operating Manuals</a>, but today I want to emphasize its advice on cultivating a commitment to quality and building in structures of ebb and flow, stress and relaxation, into your life. On first read through, this book comes off as a bit esoteric and hard to apply, but that is because it provides principles important enough to span multiple disciplines, and you will have to figure out how to apply them to your areas of concern. When you do, though, the payoff is pretty great. Read this book if you are especially interested in deeply mastering a field or if you want to improve your ability both to "turn it on" and "turn it off".

  We covered this in detail in a <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/9/1/two-creativity-frameworks-creativity-part-4">previous post</a> in this series, but it really is worth including again. Of all the books in this section, this one is the most straightforwardly actionable - it provides a step by step framework to use. The scope of the framework, though, is broad enough that I think it appropriately fits into the realm of the strategic. Read this book if you need advice on how to structure your work when presented with a problem that calls for creativity.

  I have wanted to talk about this book in this series so many times, but all I've been able to swing is a mention here and there. It is a fascinating and entertaining look at the commonalities between innovators in fields as diverse as biology, literature, and air conditioning invention. From a practical standpoint, it gives guidance on how to cultivate those commonalities in your life - such as living and interacting with "liquid networks", taking notes in a way that lets you develop "slow hunches", and allowing "fuzzy connection making". Read this book if you want structure your life in a way that maximizes your potential to innovate.

  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgeff0022">
  <p>
  Though it focuses on building a start up, the core thesis of this book is that start ups are near perfect vehicles for world-changing innovation, but to make that happen, you have to think about the world in certain ways. The most provocative way this book recommends is to seek out "secrets" - things that you know or suspect and the rest of the world either doesn't know or thinks is ridiculous - and then use those secrets to build a monopoly in a field.  To find such secrets, Thiel suggests that you ask yourself "what are things that I believe that everyone else thinks are ridiculous?" Read this book if you are trying to figure out why creativity matters or how you can change the world with it.

  The core habit for active divergence - practicing idea generation - is extremely simple and will take you far, but if you are looking for more resources on how to stretch your brain to have more and different ideas, these books will help.

In addition to specific prompts it also provides some advice on how to make sure you're still stretching yourself with your practice and what to do when you want to start moving from having a lot of ideas to having good ideas with techniques like "idea sex" and "10 things I learned from <span class="underline"><span class="underline">_</span></span>". Read this book if you feel intimidated by getting started in active divergence or you feel like you've hit a plateau.

  <p>
  A classic in the creativity field for a reason, in addition to a wonderful definition of what lateral thinking is and how it complements linear reasoning, it contains dozens of exercises designed for teachers to use with their students. The good news is that the activities are not particularly age-specific, so you can use them yourself, no teacher required! Read this book if you want more of the theoretical underpinning of why divergence is important, or if you need more diverse exercises.

  This delightfully irreverent book focuses on using playfulness and the unexpected to generate novel solutions. My favorite suggestion from the book is its recommendation to use "oracles" - something that provides arbitrary responses which you have to apply to your current situation. Read this book if you are looking for ways to get unstuck in your divergence process or if you want to inject some fun into your creative process.

  This book contains a number of group facilitation tips and tricks that will be familiar to most consultants but might be totally new in other fields. While it includes exercises that facilitate divergence as well, I have found it most useful for its suggestions on different ways to converge - from affinity mapping to dot voting, this book has a ton of interactive group activities that can help you sift through your ideas and find the good ones. Read this book if you are looking for ways to help your team identify what's valuable.

  Another one of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/my_operating_manuals_for_life">Operating Manuals</a>, in this book Cal Newport lays out how to focus on work that really matters and build a career based on quality and insight. It includes advice on how to structure your time dedicated to deep work based on the requirements of your career, how to negotiate a shallow work budget with your boss, and a method for weighing the pros and cons of digital tools for your life and work. My single favorite technique from the book is to practice being bored, so that you can learn to work through roadblocks in your creative process. Read this book if you want to tune out distractions and think hard about things to improve the quality of your insights.

  You may be sensing a theme, here, but creativity is a critical aspect of how I try to run my life, so we have yet another Operating Manual. This short book is a dose of strong, bracing medicine - Steven Pressfield takes the hardass logic of a Marine and applies it to creative endeavors. Not feeling inspired? Tough, do the work. How do you guarantee creative output? Sit your ass down and work every day. Read this book if you need a dose of equal parts tough love and inspiration to work on that important project you keep putting off.

  I first read this book years ago in college, and I absolutely love it. The author's stated intent is to help you be more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat">mentat</a>, which is just fine with me. It covers a diversity of topics from improving memory to mental clarity to, yes, creativity. This book served as my exposure to topics that would later become deeply important to me like meditation, breathing exercises, and the link between physical and mental fitness. Published by <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> it has the easy referenceability of a well-executed technical manual. I also discovered while working on this post that the author has a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Mindhacker-Tips-Tricks-Games-Level-ebook/dp/B005LGUMKQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505445702&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=mind+performance+hacks">new book</a> out on similar topics that I am eager to check out.

  Okay, last Operating Manual, I promise. This book has so much high quality stuff, but most of what will be directly relevant to creativity will be in the Wealthy and Wise sections. Robert Rodriguez's chapter in particular was an unexpected gem on the subject. Josh Waitzkin's chapter also presents a lot of what is in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505443400&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning">The Art of Learning</a> in a compressed way if you want to get a taste. "Testing the 'Impossible': 17 Questions that Changed My Life" is available as a <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/">podcast</a> and presents a useful set of lenses by which to re-assess a situation, which can lead to some great creative insights. Read this book if you want a relentless focus on practical advice that incorporates creativity into a wider goal of achievement and fulfillment.

  This delightful podcast interviews high performers in a variety of fields and focuses on the creative aspects of what they do. While the episodes stop short of digging in as much as the Tim Ferriss Show, they are also much shorter.

  I owe this show a huge debt for introducing me to a lot of the best stuff that has contributed to my thinking on creativity, including Josh Waitzkin and James Altucher. Tim gets an unbelievably diverse set of people from <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/02/02/arnold-schwarzenegger/">governators</a> to <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/30/chris-sacca/">billionaires</a> to <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/">crazy dutchmen</a>.

  There are lots of great TED talks out there, and big surprise, several of them are about creativity. This <a href="http://motto.time.com/4256296/ted-talks-creativity/">article</a> breaks down some of the best. I can vouch for Eilzabeth Gilbert's <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius">talk</a>. She talks about how useful it is for writers (and other creatives) to view inspiration as an external force coming from a muse outside of their control - because it removes the pressure of trying to be great. Instead, you just have to show up and do the work, and when the muse wants to visit, she does. It does a lot of the same work as War of Art above. Watch this talk if you keep putting off starting that creative pursuit because you're afraid it won't be good enough.

  A few years back, I went down a rabbit hole of googling "John Cleese on creativity" and discovered that after his illustrious career in comedy following founding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>, he has spent the last several years as a creativity consultant of sorts, and he has given a number of talks and appeared on shows and the like. My favorite concept is where he talks about giving yourself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g">time and an appropriate environment to be creative</a> (oh, and humor helps too) - which will sound familiar to readers of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505444434&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=deep+work">Deep Work</a>.

  Finally, creativity is all about practice and one of the best investments you can make is in a course. We've covered a chunk of the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity process</a>, but a day long course will be literally life-changing. Unless you practice, you can't really internalize a rigorous step-by-step approach to problem solving, and we all make mistakes when learning. A course solves that problem by including a skilled facilitator who knows where people are most likely to fall back on old habits and how to step in and address them. Also, you'll get to explore your <a href="https://www.basadurprofile.com/default.aspx">problem solving profile</a>, which will blow you away when you start seeing how relevant it is in the workplace. I'm sure there are lots of valuable creativity classes and events to attend, but I can whole heartedly endorse this one from experience, and I hope you get the chance to do so as well.

  This brings us to the end of our current series on creativity, but we'll continue to explore creativity here in the future.

  This one is not explicitly about creativity, but I think you'll find it more helpful in that respect than you might think at first glance. Written by a pair of Navy SEAL officers who served together in Ramadi, Iraq when it was at its worst, this book lays out deceptively simple principles for effective leadership. I say deceptive because simple does not mean easy. Following the straightforward advice is much harder than understanding it. Which brings us to creativity: this book's advice on building discipline will help you immensely in building the habits you need for quality creativity.

  <b>Date</b>: 2017-September-08
  </p>

  <p>
  In the previous posts on creativity, I’ve mentioned “inputs” pretty frequently, but I haven’t gone into much detail about them. Today, I’ll talk about what I mean by inputs, why they’re important, and share some rules for maximizing their usefulness. I’m very excited to be sharing this with you, because I think it’s an often overlooked aspect of creativity that can have huge effects on your work with very little effort.
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, let’s get on the same page about what I mean by inputs. I am using this fairly vague term to mean anything that you read, watch, listen to, view, or otherwise interact with in the hopes that it will contribute directly or indirectly to your creative process. That’s a pretty broad, abstract definition, let’s go for some examples. A novel you read for pleasure is probably an input, but one you read to get in the right frame of mind for writing your own story is definitely one. Music you listen to while you drive to work might be an indirect input, but music you analyze for technical skills you might incorporate into your own performance definitely is. The bill you get in the mail almost definitely is not an input, but hey, it just might inspire you. What these distinctions point to is that “input” is not really a category with discrete edges, but rather a radial based on intent: some things are dead center, others are so far away that they almost definitely won’t function as creative inputs. One of the reasons we have to talk probabilistically rather than deterministically is the role the subconscious plays in creativity: a relevant connection to that story you read three years ago might suddenly pop into your head, even if you were reading it with no particular purpose at the time. As such, while the rules I recommend below will serve you well with any sort of material you engage with, you don’t have to become a total hardass about everything you interact with - apply these more rigorously in areas you are specifically targeting for your creative work (unless you really want to). So without further ado, here’s Jeff’s rules for creative inputs:
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgb062584"></a>1- Privilege Long Form over Short<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb062584">
  <p>
  As much as possible, pick a book over a blog post, a blog post over a tweet, a tweet over a comment. Seek out longer, more involved renditions of whatever you need, and actively avoid shorter versions where possible. There are a couple of reasons for this - first off, the longer something is, the more likely that the creator <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/28/how-to-build-a-large-audience-from-scratch-and-more/">put some real thought into it</a> and genuinely cared about it. This isn’t an ironclad rule, but it’s a reasonably useful heuristic. This can be hard to swallow in a world obsessed with speed, efficiency, and convenience - but remember, our goal here isn’t to go through as much stuff as possible, it’s to get genuine, long-lasting benefit from high quality stuff. Secondly, even if the longer form content isn’t actually any better than shorter stuff, engaging with it lets you <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">exercise your attention span</a>. As many of us have noticed in the age of the smartphone and constant availability, you can lose your ability to focus on just one thing at a time when every day is full of constant task switching. Fortunately, it works the other way too - you can practice focusing on one thing at a time for extended periods and <a href="https://calnewport.com/neil-gaimans-advice-to-writers-get-bored/">get comfortable with the boredom</a> you will almost certainly feel at some point. So longer stuff gives you a double whammy for improving creativity - higher quality material that simultaneously improves your ability to focus.
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="org4f5d38b"></a>2 - Go for Depth over Breadth<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f5d38b">
  <p>
  As with the advice in a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#two_creativity_frameworks">previous post</a>, to alternate rest and effort, this one also comes from <a href="https://joshwaitzkin.com">Josh Waitzkin</a>. We are living in a world of nearly infinite information at our fingertips, so you are unlikely to be challenged by a lack of exposure to neat stuff. Rather, you are at a much greater risk of never truly diving deep into something and finding the beautiful insights only available to someone who truly masters it. I’ve got to admit, following my own advice on this rule is incredibly hard - I am a hardcore serial dabbler. Breadth can be fantastic for creating truly novel connections between disparate material, but paradoxically, pursuing depth is required for truly getting the value out of breadth. If you have only a shallow understanding of two topics, you will only know what makes them different, or only perceive the similarities that are so obvious as to be worthless. Only a deep understanding of a topic will allow you to see its principles embodied in unexpected places.

  <li><a id="org6f76677"></a>3 - Actively Engage<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f76677">
  <p>
  At this point, you may have noticed a distinct lack of the terms "consume” and “content” - this has been entirely intentional. Consumption passively implies the material does all the real work, but creativity requires action. Likewise, content has a certain connotation of things produced to fill space or support some other aim, rather than for its intrinsic beauty or worth. So, I have emphasized interaction and engagement because you have to make material your own before you can use it in your creative process: probe it, question it, internalize it. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The best way I know how to actually do this is by creating some version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>. Ryan Holiday <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">explains</a> the method he learned from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190714230235/http://powerseductionandwar.com/">Robert Greene</a>, which involves index cards in a box. I am strongly tempted to give this method a shot due to my love of all things analog, but thus far I have been seduced by the various conveniences of digital, and so use Evernote. My very favorite feature is the Evernote Web Clipper plugin for my browser. This allows me to easily store blog posts, articles, even entire web pages right alongside quotes, .pdfs, and my own notes. Further, I can sort and tag all of this stuff so that I can identify connections and themes when I review. The other feature that makes Evernote especially conducive to creativity is Context, which points to notes, websites, and other material that might be relevant to what you're currently viewing. Now, Context doesn’t always get it right, but the beauty is that this kind of <a href="https://www.alibris.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-from-The-Natural-History-of-Innovation-Steven-Johnson/book/12949732?matches=171">"fuzzy" connection-making introduces just enough errors to spur you to creative insights</a>, while usually helping you find things that you’re looking for. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Whatever method you choose to use for engaging with your inputs, make sure you do not simply passively read, listen, or view: grab your inputs and shake them until their lunch money falls out.
  </p>

  <p>
  To close, I'll repeat a no-doubt familiar refrain: there is so much more we could cover here, and I look forward to digging into it with you in the future. For now you've got a great set of easy rules you can start applying to the material you use in your creative process. I also want to point out that all of the creativity methods, exercises, and rules we’ve covered so far are multiplicative rather than additive - every one you adopt makes all of the others more effective. Little daily habits add up to life changing results pretty fast. Next time, we'll cover some resources to help you move beyond this base camp and venture into the wilds of creativity.

  Ryan Holiday has been behind a lot of what I've talked about here and a lot of the links I've shared, but I haven't called him out explicitly yet. He's a modern day exponent of an ancient philosophy, and though my interest in stoicism predates my exposure to Holiday, I have found his works useful and engaging. He's best known for <i>The Obstacle is the Way</i>, which has been hugely influential with top performers from the business world to the NFL, but I have found this book more useful personally. It is a systematic analysis of how prone we all are to excessive self regard and the ways that destroys you - whether you are aspiring, achieving, or failing. Ego also hinders true creativity because it stops you from the real work you need to push limits and discover new frontiers.

  Tim Ferriss and Ramit Sethi like to joke about how much their book titles sound like infomercials, but I have to admit that this book has them beat by a mile - One Minute Workout? That's even crazier than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB2di69FmhE">six minute abs</a>. What you find when you actually dig in, though, is a thorough discussion of the science and benefits of High Intensity Interval Training. Even better, it presents a variety of HIIT workouts you can try out for your own health. Bang-for-buck-wise, HIIT is the king of exercises. Even better, training your heart to speed up and slow down regularly has dramatic effects on your brain's ability to do the same - so following the workouts in this book will help you not only be healthier, but more creative to boot. Not a bad deal for one minute (plus another 9 of warm up, cool down, and rest - but I can't blame them for the catchy title).

  <title>Two Creativity Frameworks - Creativity Part 4</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2017-September-01
  </p>

  <p>
  In our last installment in this series, we talked about <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/25/practicing-divergent-convergent-thinking-creativity-part-3">divergent and convergent thinking</a>. Keep that in mind, as it will be central to everything we discuss below. Today, we're going to talk about frameworks you can use to structure your creative efforts - one for teams and one for individuals. You can use either framework in the other situation, but I find them better suited to different applications.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we discussed creativity frameworks <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">previously</a>, I mentioned the <a href="http://www.basadur.com/howwedoit/An8StepProcess/tabid/82/Default.aspx">Basadur Applied Creativity</a> method. It is comprehensive and fantastic, but I'm not going to lay out the whole system (go <a href="http://www.basadur.com/whatwedo/SkillBuildingWorkshops/tabid/75/Default.aspx">sign up</a> for a class!). Instead, I will focus on the 80/20 piece of the framework: Problem Formulation. This piece of the process is valuable precisely because people tend to blow it off if they aren't trained otherwise. In practice, taking the time to formulate the right problem statement makes an enormous difference in the quality of your solutions. One last point before we jump in: I have not attended any of the instructor certification workshops for this method - so take all this as the advice of a fellow practitioner, not as gospel.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, with that out of the way, let's jump in. The first step is to take a "fuzzy situation" that your team wants to make better and come up with potential problems related to this fuzzy situation. A fuzzy situation might be something like "we aren't selling enough sprockets." In this and each following step, you will diverge and converge as separate, clear activities. It helps to have a designated facilitator around to shepherd people through the process. So, everyone diverges on potential problems - things like "our sales people are lazy," or "nobody wants sprockets anymore" or "lizard people are secretly sabotaging our sprocket selling efforts" - remember, bad ideas are welcome and even helpful when diverging. Your goal here is to get every possible thing that might be a problem out on the table - that's one reason this method works so well with groups, as it helps to get all the little bits of knowledge in different people's heads out and in the open where everybody can use it.
  </p>

  <p>
  With lots of potential problems to consider, the group looks at them and converges on which ones are most worth developing further. To figure out if you're right, you're going to need facts - so step two is Fact Finding. If you skip this step, down the road you will hit a snag. Again, diverge on what facts might be relevant, and then converge on the ones that really are most useful. I should point out that at this phase, "facts" can include things that you know you need to learn. You can use these awesome fact finding questions to make sure you cover all your bases:
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>What do we know or think we know?</li>
  <li>What don't we know that we would like to?</li>
  <li>What have we already thought or tried?</li>
  <li>Why is this a problem for us?</li>
  <li>What will we get if we solve this problem?</li>
  <li>What are we assuming?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  The last step in Problem formulation is to arrive at a Problem Definition: a phrase or sentence that clearly states what it is that your team is actually trying to solve. A good problem definition will come in the form of "How might we <span class="underline"><span class="underline">_</span></span>?" As always, diverge on lots of possible problem statements based on the facts, and then converge on the one your team wants to focus on solving right now. If you have lots of potentially valuable problem statements, that's fine - you can always come back to them later, but you want to focus on the most valuable one until you solve it. This probably all seems rather involved just to figure out what the problem is, but after going through this a few times you'll see how valuable it is to take the time to aim at the right target instead of just blasting away at whatever presents itself.
  </p>

  <p>
  As I mentioned <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/8/17/the-building-blocks-of-creativity">last time</a>, while the AC approach is amazing for teams, especially in a business setting, I find it a bit involved for individual creative work. For this, I like to follow Young's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503617585&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. The steps are pretty straightforward and his book spells them out well: gather materials, work them over to the point of exhaustion, put them out of your mind, wait for an idea to appear, and then modify the idea based on trusted feedback. I want to highlight two areas: working over the materials and putting them out of your mind.
  </p>

  <p>
  Most folks these days have heard some variation of "<a href="https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/8156/is-there-any-scientific-literature-on-the-shower-principle-i-e-taking-a-bre">the shower principle</a>": the idea that creative insight often appears while doing something totally unrelated to the topic. Many of these people try to help it along by purposely changing activities to something unrelated to their challenge, relying on their subconscious to do the heavy lifting. Putting the work out of your mind is a great strategy, and an essential component for "aha!" insights, but going right to it misses a critical step: getting the material into a form your subconscious can work with. Your subconscious deals in feelings and intents and symbols, and not so much in words and reason. Unless you already deeply care about the topic, it is in a language your subconscious doesn't speak, so you have to translate the material.
  </p>

  <p>
  To do so, you have to work at the material until it seeps deep into your mind - repetition is essential, and if you can find a way to intensify your emotional connection to the material, so much the better. What this looks like in practice is that you do everything your conscious mind can think of with the material - try different approaches, tweak different parts, re-arrange the parts - and keep doing that until it starts to look like mumbo jumbo and you hit a mental brick wall. The tricky part is telling the difference between "I'm a little bored" and "I really have nothing more to do with this" - pushing through that initial boredom is <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/09/05/john-cage-on-the-necessity-of-boredom/">critical</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you aren't sure which you're experiencing, take a short break without any new inputs - go for a walk, get some water, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/09/15/bootcamp-day-1/">that kind of thing</a>. Come back and promise yourself another 15-20 minutes on the matter at hand, even if you're just staring at your work so far.  If you still don't get anywhere, then maybe you're done working it over for now.
  </p>

  <p>
  Only after you've internalized the material by doing everything you can think of with it do you want to put it out of your mind. Sometimes this can be easier said than done. If something is important enough to you for your subconscious to be able to do its thing, chances are that your conscious mind won't want to drop it. Here's a few things to help you out. First off, remind yourself that while it feels like you're "not doing anything," putting it out of your mind is an essential step in doing something about it. This can be hard, especially if you're a take-charge type - hence the conscious reminder. Second, it helps to choose something you find intrinsically enjoyable and emotionally stimulating. Not only is it easier to ignore a problem when you're enjoying something you love, the positive emotional engagement also stimulates the subconscious that you are relying on. Finally, much of your mind's ability to alternate between going hard and relaxing is directly influenced by your body's ability to do the same. Remember the <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/5/26/preventative-maintenance-self-care-part-2">bi-directional nature of stress and physiology</a>? Same deal. Josh Waitzkin talks about this quite a bit in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503618266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning">his book</a> and his <a href="https://tim.blog/tag/josh-waitzkin/">interviews</a> with Tim Ferriss. Strangely, because of this physical element, one of the best creativity exercises is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">High Intensity Interval Training</a>. The <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/One-Minute-Workout-Science-Smarter-Shorter-ebook/dp/B01IOHQ7RA/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">One Minute Workout</a> lays out several options for planning your HIIT workouts. Even if you don't go in for HIIT workouts, other physical considerations are still critical: at least eat well, get enough rest, and stay active somehow.
  </p>

  <p>
  With the the two approaches above, you have some concrete guidance on what to do when you want to "be creative." I've focused on the non-obvious pieces of these two frameworks, but both are worth checking out in full when you have the chance. Next time we'll talk about some habits you can adopt to increase the quality and usefulness of the inputs to your creative process.

  <title>Practicing Divergent and Convergent Thinking - Creativity Part 3</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2017-August-25
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so I had planned on covering all of the exercises in one post, but when I broke them out, I realized I would be delivering a gigantic, hard to digest mess. So I broke it up. Our next few posts will cover all of the exercises associated with the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/the_building_blocks_of_creativity">building blocks</a> we covered last time, starting with Divergent and Convergent thinking today. It's a great place to start, because if you develop your ability to separate these two ways of thinking, everything else will flow naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
  For many people, the skill you will most need to improve is your ability to think up ideas - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">active divergence</a>. If you're like me, this seems like a mysterious ability some people are born with, and is totally opaque. Fortunately, whether or not some folks are more naturally inclined to be good at it, you can practice and improve. My favorite practice for this comes from <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a>. Here it is: write 10 ideas on a prompt, once a day every day. That's it. I first encountered it in his book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-Guide-Wealth-ebook/dp/B00U7IS4S0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503612736&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=choose+yourself+guide+to+wealth">The Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth</a>, which is one of my <a href="https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life">mental operating manuals</a>, but you can also find it explained in this blog <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/">post on how to be "lucky"</a>. The lists don't even have to be on anything important - silly stuff works just as well for practicing. You aren't shooting for good ideas, you just come up with a lot of ideas. This is pure active divergence practice. As you do this regularly enough, you will start finding it much easier to think things up on the spot in any situation, which comes in pretty darn handy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's say you're jamming on the above practice and you screech to a halt, unable to think of any more ideas. Here's a few techniques you can use to get the juices flowing again. The first is "unclumping" - look at one of the ideas you've already written and ask yourself what every possible variation of that thing might be. Say your prompt was "things that are round," and one of your ideas was "balls." You could unclump that by writing baseballs, basketballs, bocce balls, et cetera. If you are wired like I am, this may feel like you are "cheating," but actually you are stimulating exactly the muscle we want to exercise here. The next technique is to apply your five senses to the subject you are trying to generate ideas on. Maybe you're locked into things that stimulate sight, or feel, and are ignoring others. In the case of things that are round, "smell" might make you think of an orange, or "taste" might prompt you to think of a scoop of ice cream - and then you can go off in a whole new direction. Finally, there's a specific list of modifications you can apply in a handy acronym: T.R.A.N.S.F.O.R.M. - Twist/Turn, Rotate, Add, Novelize, Subtract, Fuse, Omit, Reverse, Minify/Magnify. I tend to default to unclumping when I feel stuck, but all three can really help you expand the number of ideas you generate.
  </p>

  <p>
  We've covered how to generate more ideas, but some people find that relatively easy and instead are challenged by what to do with them once you have them. These people need more practice with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">active convergence</a>. Personally, I find this far easier and more intuitive than cranking ideas out, so I've had to engage in some reflection and discussion with people who think differently from me to figure out what to recommend here. There are two main ways you can come at evaluating the ideas you have previously generated: bottom up or top down. Bottom up approaches focus on evaluating ideas based on their similarity to each other, whereas top down focus on rating ideas with respect to how they fit pre-defined criteria.
  </p>

  <p>
  My personal favorite convergence activity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram">affinity mapping</a>. This is a bottom up approach used to organically figure out groupings and categories. To give it a try, first actively diverge as above, but put each idea on its own sticky note. Then, find a big stretch of wall or whiteboard and start putting the ideas up there . As you add ideas, look at the existing ones and ask yourself "do these go together?" If so, place them close to each other. Don't worry too much about explicitly defining the criteria that makes them go together just yet. As you go through, you'll find that some of your clumps maybe should be split up, and others should be merged - that's okay, the point of the exercise is to discover these relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
  An example top down approach is a model called a <a href="http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/pugh-matrix.html">Pugh Matrix</a> - a name I only recently learned from an engineer friend for something I've been doing for years. To do this, put each idea on a line in a spreadsheet. Then, label each column with the different criteria you are using. Then go through the matrix you just created and rate each criteria on the same scale (1-5 is a common one, but you can also go for binary or just use whatever makes sense). When you finish, you'll have a score both for each individual criterion but also an aggregate. If you want to get real fancy, you can apply different weights to different criteria. You can then perform all sorts of manipulations on the data so created (averages, spreads, et cetera). Just be careful to remind yourself that this is still a qualitative and subjective tool, despite its appearance of being a quantitative and objective tool thanks to all those numbers - just remind yourself you made them all up, you didn't measure them somewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
  By way of an example, my wife and I applied this system when we bought a house. Before we started looking, we came up with a list of features that mattered to us. Once we had identified two houses we liked, we compared them by rating each characteristic. By going through piece by piece and seeing how both houses stacked up, it made it very clear which one we actually favored. So we put in an offer and ended up in a place we love, with the peace of mind that we thought out our decisions thoroughly.  
  </p>

  <p>
  The above exercises are merely examples of the deeper principles of divergent and convergent thinking, but extremely useful and illuminating examples. Idea generation especially is a habit you can incorporate into your daily life and start noticing its application in diverse situations. Join us next time as we discuss how to apply and practice the two problem solving frameworks we introduced previously.

  <p>
  <b>By Edward de Bono</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  I mentioned this book in the previous posts on creativity, but it didn't get its own spotlight yet. It's a classic in the realm of creativity, and a lot of what has been developed since builds on its solid foundation. It takes an extremely practical approach by recommending various exercises a teacher might assign students to encourage and develop lateral thinking, but these are just as easily self-imposed by those of us lacking adult supervision. My very favorite takeaway from this book is the idea that sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea first.

  <title>The Building Blocks of Creativity - Creativity Part 2</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2017-August-18
  </p>

  <p>
  Last time we came up with a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/defining_creativity">definition of creativity</a>, and today we're going to talk about some of its core building blocks, from deferring judgment to the inputs you take in. These fundamental concepts will give you the raw materials you need to understand and undertake specific exercises to be more creative yourself - some of which we'll detail in our next installment of the series.
  </p>

  <p>
  The first and most important concept you need for better creativity comes from Edward De Bono's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Step-ebook/dp/B003V1WTLI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502986629&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lateral+thinking">Lateral Thinking</a>: sometimes to get to a good idea, you have to go through a bad idea. Everything else we'll talk about grows from this small seed. You can grasp this simple idea in moments, but like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Othello</a>, you can spend a lifetime truly mastering it. For your first challenge, the entire tradition of western thought has focused on <a href="http://www.andyeklund.com/is-linear-thinking-bad/">Linear Thinking</a>, which de Bono contrasts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">Lateral Thinking</a> in his book of the same name. Our education and culture reinforce linear thinking relentlessly. It requires every step make sense and build to the next. It's how you make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument#Deductive">an argument that doesn't suck</a>. It's how you prove things in math or map out a promising theory in science. If one step is wrong, every step after it is wrong, end of story. So when you operate in a linear thinking mode, you carefully check every step of progress to make sure you're still on firm ground.
  </p>

  <p>
  Don't get me wrong: linear thinking is extremely important, despite being less sexy than lateral thinking. At some point, you have to figure out if your brilliant idea actually works. The trouble is that linear thinking can hamper you from having the good idea in the first place. Sometimes something silly or wrong gets you to look at a problem in a new way, which produces genuine insight. You give yourself permission to have bad ideas that can get to good ideas later with a habit of thought called <a href="https://blog.basadur.com/2015/02/04/does-deferring-judgment-really-impact-creativity-or-does-immediate-judgement-save-a-lot-of-time-and-provide-the-hard-nosed-focus-that-real-world-innovation-demands/">Active Deferral of Judgement</a>.  Simply catch yourself whenever you go "that was silly" or "that will never work" while you are trying to think up ideas. We'll talk more in the next part of the series about techniques to build this habit.
  </p>

  <p>
  Deferring judgment lets us properly separate thinking into its two flavors: <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">divergent</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">and</a> <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/idea-generation-divergent-vs-convergent-thinking/">convergent</a>. Divergent thinking is maximizing the number of ideas on the table - it is often referred to as ideation or idea generation. Convergent thinking is looking at previously created ideas and deciding which ones are relevant - it is often called evaluation. Both kinds of thinking are equally important and equally necessary - remember that my definition of creativity requires things be both new and useful.
  </p>

  <p>
  Turns out most of us find it easier to do one or the other, and if we don't learn about these differences, we get puzzled by other people's challenges. For example, I have a friend who can fill a page with brand new ideas while I'm still struggling to break 10. On the other hand, ask him to take 100 things and group them based on similarity and he'll be agonizing while I'm happily clustering sticky notes. The important thing is <a href="https://melanism.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cropped-header2013.jpg">don't cross the streams</a>. Unlike chocolate and peanut butter, these two flavors are not better together. Prematurely converging hinders your ability to produce ideas, and coming up with ideas distracts you from evaluating what you already have. Again, we'll go into some tools next time for how to successfully separate these.
  </p>

  <p>
  Even though I'm sure you will start applying the above concepts all over the place already, there's another step for maximum effectiveness. If you point a group of people at a problem and say "Diverge then converge and come back to me with something great!" they're probably going to spend a lot of time spinning their wheels. To get around that, you need a process or framework that gives guidance on what to diverge on, and what criteria to use for convergence.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of the best frameworks for teams is <a href="http://www.basadur.com/">Basadur Applied Creativity</a>. It consists of an eight part problem solving cycle with divergence and convergence in each phase. It's remarkably effective for surfacing the best stuff from a group and generating creative solutions to problems with buy in from everyone on the team. I use it at work all the time, and I'm consistently amazed by what we we get when we use the process versus when we don't.
  </p>

  <p>
  For individual creative pursuit, though, I find the Basadur approach a bit heavyweight. Instead, I prefer the framework laid out in <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Technique-Producing-Ideas-James-Young-ebook/dp/B00N33OYPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502990296&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas">A Technique for Producing Ideas</a>. It is straightforward, actionable, and consistently produces individual insights when followed. Plus, you want to talk about bang for buck? This 42 page book will revolutionize how you work on your own creative projects. We'll talk through how to apply both of these frameworks next time.
  </p>

  <p>
  We often overlook the last concept I want to talk about when we are thinking of creativity as an active pursuit: our <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/creative-output-requires-quality-inputs/#gs.WY=bvIM">inputs</a>. If you want to think well, you need things to think about, and those come from what you read, watch, hear, and do. Remember that our definition from last time emphasized the role of finding new connections between existing material in creativity. Your inputs determine both the existing material and the ideas for new connections you have to work with. We live in an age of near unlimited informational options, so next time I'll discuss some of the ways I like to make decisions about what inputs to seek out and experience.
  </p>

  <p>
  As we talked about, creativity is a much discussed topic, so I've left out a number of interesting ideas and focused on the most essential. You could do worse than to check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">Wikipedia article</a> on creativity if you want to check out some stuff not covered here. I found the discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Affect">Affect</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#REM_sleep">Sleep</a> especially thought provoking. I was also fascinated by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502991782&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=where+good+ideas+come+from">Where Good Ideas Come From</a>, but it looks more at cultural and strategic ways to foster creativity - how does a society end up creative or what can someone do over the course of their life to cultivate creative insights, rather than "what can I do when I sit down with a specific problem today?" There's a lot of high quality thinking out there on creativity, and I look forward to revisiting the topic for a long time to come.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so I've laid out why Active Deferral of Judgement, Divergence/Convergence, Framework, and Inputs are the basic components of creativity. Next time we'll go through examples of how to actually apply each of these concepts, but even without that, you now how a powerful toolbox for thinking about and working with creativity.

  <b>By James Webb Young</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  This book might be the best "bang for the buck" I've ever seen - at 42 pages, you can easily read it in an evening and almost every single page is chock full of useful, actionable tips. It lays out the steps to follow in order to generate new, creative ideas. While it lacks some of the concepts we go through in our creativity series, it easily integrates with them. Do yourself a favor and check this out.

  </p>

  <p>
  When I sat down to write a post about innovation, I quickly realized we had an unwieldy topic on our hands. So, instead of a single post on innovation and the future, I've decided to kick off a short series on creativity. To begin with, I'll provide my favorite definition of creativity and step through each piece of it and what it implies for applications down the road.
  </p>

  <p>
  Just about anyone you talk to wants to be "more creative,"  but what does that really mean? There are <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/define-creativity/">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.basadur.com/insightsresearch/OurThoughtsonCreativityandInnovation/tabid/80/Default.aspx">different</a> ways to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creativity">define</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creativity</a>, and some of them are maddeningly vague or fluffy. Often, we associate creativity only with "artsy" pursuits like painting or poetry and assume that it doesn't apply to more hard-nosed disciplines. I think that nothing could be farther from the truth. So I've cobbled together various definitions in a way that is equally useful whether you are creating art or building a business: the ability to make useful new connections between concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's start unpacking that definition, beginning with the core: making connections. We like to idealize creativity as conjuring something out of nothing, but really, to have new ideas, you have to have raw material. That's one reason why creativity requires voraciously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2pre2xnA1M">reading, watching, and listening to interesting and diverse material</a>. No one argues that being creative is just knowing about a bunch of different stuff, though. You gotta connect that stuff. That's one reason games, randomizers, and "oracles" can be so <a href="http://blog.creativethink.com/2007/01/use_a_random_id.html">useful for spurring creativity</a> - they force connections where none existed previously.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so if creativity is about making connections, the thing that makes those connections "creative" is that they are new. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">first time</a> someone noticed that cats and people and elephants have something in common with each other that they don't with snakes and lizards, that was creative. Noticing it today is not. We are all standing on the shoulders of everyone who has come before us, extending the network of associations further and further into conceptual space.  At first this can seem a bit intimidating, like everything really worthwhile has already been figured out. Here's the thing, though: because this network of connections that has been made, we have exponentially more raw material to work with than anyone else in the history of humanity. That's pretty awesome if you ask me. We're going to dive more into how lucky we really are when we talk about practical ways to be more creative in our own lives.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, our new connections must also be useful. As we'll discuss later when we talk about specific techniques, it can actually hinder your ability to come up with stuff if start out too focused on "what's useful." That's just a phase in the process though, and the difference between <a href="http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/">brilliant and silly</a> is how much value people get out of the connection you have made for them. As we'll see when we dive into more "how to" later in the series, one of the most challenging things to do can be to allow ourselves to be silly at one phase while ruthlessly <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html">killing our darlings</a> later on.
  </p>

  <p>
  We've stepped through why creativity is about connections, how those connections have to be new, and why they need to be useful to qualify as "creative". With this definition in mind, our future posts will get to the good stuff: practical advice to get you on the path to more creativity in your life and work.

  <b>By Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  If you spend as much time as I do listening to podcasts by Silicon Valley types, you've been hearing about this book for ages. I've been putting off reading it because I figured "well, I'm not starting a tech company, so it doesn't apply to me." Turns out that was a silly and limited way to think about the book. I ended up valuing it more for its discussion of the secrets that are the root of real economic value and its concepts of definite versus indefinite optimism. It was also the inspiration for the current series, as it talked about the importance of creativity and implementation in building the future world. It's a pretty quick read and well worth it.

  <p>
  <b>By Zhuang Zi, trans. Burton Watson</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  This is an excerpt of the complete Zhuangzi, and I'm normally a rabid completionist, but there are three facts that lead me to recommend this edition: 1. This is the version I had in my physical library and therefore read, 2. The translator makes a pretty good case that what is excluded is mostly later (less awesome) additions to the work of the original author, and 3. you can get this excerpt for about one third of the price of the complete works. So, with that in mind, let me tell you what's great about this book. It's a lot more lively than most philosophy, featuring poetry, metaphor, and humor. I found it almost as valuable as a demonstration of an alternative way to convey deep, important ideas as I did for the actual ideas it was discussing. It's also interestingly different from the Daoism you may know from the <i>Daodejing</i>. I'm not going to get a Yin-Yang symbol tattooed on me anytime soon, but I have found this a worthwhile addition to my mental tool kit.
  </p>

  <i><p>A Note on Spelling Conventions - Skip if you are not a language nerd:</p>

  <p>Since westerners started studying Chinese, they have tried to get around the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to render it. For years the most popular way was the “Wade-Giles System,” which uses various letter combinations as kludges to represent tones. It is a clever way to operate within the constraints of existing letters, but if you don’t know the code, you’re gonna say everything wrong.</p>

  <p>More recently, the People’s Republic of China has introduced the pinyin system. The key feature of which is the use of diacritic marks to indicate tones, which is incredibly useful for ignorant westerners like me. With this, you can be much more straightforward in your use of letters, so even if you get the tones wrong, you’re at least getting the rest right. Because of this, I have decided to ditch the Wade-Giles spellings familiar from my youth and use pinyin without the diacritics (because they are a pain in the ass on an English keyboard).</p></i>

  <p>
  I decided to take advantage of my vacation in China to read some Chinese philosophy in the land that gave it birth. Looking over my bookshelf, I noticed a book I had purchased for a college class - Zhuangzi. In the class we only read a tiny excerpt, and ever since it’s been on my “meaning to read” list. So I ended up pulling it out of my bag and digging in while floating through a landscape that looks exactly like a Chinese landscape painting. 
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, let’s provide a bit of context. “Zhuangzi” can refer to both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou">philosopher</a> (“Master Zhuang”) or to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">work ascribed to him</a> (but probably containing material added later by other people as well). Besides the semi-mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Laozi</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Daodejing</a>, Zhuangzi is the next most foundational work in Daoism. The philosopher was a rough contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a>’s in the 4th century BCE. Both of these eminent gentlemen helped to define the explosion of thinking known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought">“The Hundred Schools of Thought”</a>. In terms of influence on later philosophy, this time period is roughly analogous to the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy">Hellenisitic age</a> in the west  - a flowering of different approaches that are still discussed, debated, and even followed today. This author of Zhuangzi used this context by telling stories featuring members of other schools of thought - sometimes showing them as fellow seekers of wisdom and other times mercilessly parodying them and their hang ups. 
  </p>

  <p>
  One of the things that struck me in the book was the similarity of the core of the philosophy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Zhuangzi essentially argues that the world is constantly changing and the only way to not be perturbed by this is align yourself with that change, which is an expression of the universal Way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Dao</a>). Despite some important differences, the core idea that we can’t control circumstances, but we can control how we react to them, will sound familiar to students of the two schools I mentioned. I will have to reread the <i>Daodejing</i>, but I don’t remember such a clear parallel there. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that such a useful and life-changing mental hack was independently discovered in multiple places. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Which is by no means to say that <i>Zhuangzi</i> is simply a rehash of things you can find elsewhere. It is widely renowned for its imagery, poetry, and imaginative use of metaphor. Some of these struck me as simply bizarre, but many were rather beautiful. One of these poetic sections has become more famous in the west than the book that spawned it: Zhuangzi is the sage who dreamed he was a butterfly and then wondered if he were not a butterfly dreaming of being a man. Besides the imagery, the other ingredient in Zhuangzi’s secret sauce is humor, and there were several times where I would slowly smile or even chuckle as I realized something that I thought was “serious business” was actually the set up for an elaborate joke. When you put these two stylistic traits together, you get a very interesting effect: since you never know exactly where the author stands moment to moment, or even necessarily what he actually means, you have to think for yourself. You can neither buy everything he says uncritically nor dismiss him as someone you disagree with unconditionally. It’s a remarkably effective way to convey something experientially instead of didactically.
  </p>

  <p>
  To demonstrate this dynamic produced by humor, metaphor, and active engagement, let me share my favorite example. Zhuangzi frequently praises the “useless” and denigrates the “useful.” One image he uses is a <a href="http://mjglass.ca/metaphor/uselesstree.htm">gigantic tree</a> that has only been allowed to get so big because no part of it has any usefulness to humans - which would have gotten it cut down or plucked or such like. He similarly points out that useful people get put to work and sometimes even get killed doing that work, and so argues it’s good to be crippled and deformed. I was finding it hard to swallow the whole “useless is good, useful is bad” line of reasoning until one <a href="https://terebess.hu/english/chuangtzu3.html#26">striking metaphor</a> got me:
  </p>

  <p>
  "A man has to understand the useless before you can talk to him about the useful. The earth is certainly vast and broad, though a man uses no more of it than the area he puts his feet on. If, however, you were to dig away all the earth from around his feet until you reached the Yellow Springs, then would the man still be able to make use of it?"
  </p>

  <p>
  I had a koan-like flash of insight reading this about all of the other images I had been reading. If not for that moment, I might have written the whole work off as anti-rational nonsense. For you, the “click” might come somewhere else because of a different interaction of the imagery, humor, and your own thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
  Though I still find the <i>Daodejing</i> more relevant, Zhuangzi’s skepticism and anti-authoriatarianism was a welcome breath of fresh air in the sometimes puzzling field of Daoism, and gave me a wider understanding of the philosophy than I previously had. It also opened my mind to alternative ways to convey philosophical truths. If you have made previous forays into Chinese philosophy and found them dull or staid, perhaps you should give <i>Zhuangzi</i> a try.
  </p>

  <b>By Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  Neal Stephenson is probably my favorite living author, and so I buy anything with his name on it no questions asked. I tore through this on my recent flight to Beijing and rather enjoyed it. A shadowy government organization discovers that magic used to be real but doesn't work anymore, and then figures out a way to make it work again to send people back in time. A fun read that touches on all of the exciting possibilities of magic, time travel, and quantum physics. Not as many detailed asides as a pure Stephenson book, but that means that it keeps moving at a brisk pace the whole time. Give it a shot if the idea of mashing up fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction gets you all hot and bothered.

  This one didn't quite make it on to my <a href="#my_operating_manuals_for_life">list of operating manuals</a>, in part because I just finished it a week or two ago and I'm not sure how much of an impact it's had on me yet. It might sound hopelessly like positive thinking hippy dippy crap, but I've been getting more and more convinced about the power of auto-suggestion, in part because of the Scott Adams <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/persuasion-reading-list-updated-1-18/">persuasion reading list</a> I've mentioned before. So I'm giving the approaches recommended in this book a good, honest try before I either dismiss it or sing its praises. If you do the same, let me know how it works out for you.

  <i>Update 2022-August-25: I no longer give as central a place to many of these books as I did when I wrote this five(!) years ago. For example, I'm not a big fan of James Altucher anymore, as my further exposure to him has made him seem scammy and dishonest. So while there's nothing in the</i> Choose Yourself Guide to Wealth <i>that seems obviously bad or wrong, I don't trust it as a whole anymore. Some other books, like</i> The Poetic Edda <i>have become far more central to my life and understanding of the world. Obviously, your mileage may vary, and I wanted to keep this post as a record of where my thinking was at the time.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  If you accept that you have your own User Interface, you’re going to need some instructions on how to set it up and maintain it. As you know, my go to source for just about everything is books, and I have found those on the list below especially useful for hacking together my own mental operating system. They currently sit right on my desk where I can see them every day and think about what they mean to me.

  <b>By Tim Ferriss</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  This is the most practical book on this list, and I’m most confident it will be immediately useful to you.  I consider it the 80/20 solution of self-help books, the one to read if you can only read one.  Chock full of amazing tips, tricks, and strategies for improving your life in every dimension, I have adopted more ideas from here than I can keep track of. While all three of Tim Ferriss’s previous books have had a tremendous positive impact on my life, this is the capstone.

  </p>

  <p>
  Tony Robbins’s main work on personal transformation and behavior change. I have used this book not only to shape my approach to coaching but also to upgrade my own mental Operating System across the board. I have used it to ditch bad habits, take positive action in my life, and otherwise convince myself that my life is what I make of it. If you aren’t sure what you think of Tony Robbins, check out the Netflix documentary I Am Not Your Guru to get a good taste of what he’s about.

  <p>
  <b>By James Altucher</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  The most recent edition to my collection, a month or two back my friend was like “you need to read this right now,” and he was right. James Altucher argues three main points in the book: secure corporate employment for your entire life is dead and gone, it’s up to you to bring value to the world, and the best way to do that is to follow a daily practice that nourishes and improves yourself mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. He supplements all of this with a number of specific techniques on freelancing, selling, networking, and so forth. Some of the books on this list had already laid the groundwork for believing that financial success comes from no other source than me, but this book gave me the tactical kick in the butt I needed to start acting.

  <b>By Cal Newport</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  Equal parts manifesto and field guide, Cal Newport argues that focusing on one thing at a time and choosing important, hard work is a super power in a world of constant distraction. My own experience bears this out - when I most seriously follow the approach explained in this book, not only do I get more work done, I feel more fulfilled and happier about it to boot. This book is essential reading if you want to achieve mastery in anything or even just stand out from your peers at work.

  <p>
  <b>By Joshua Waitzkin</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  One of the more challenging books on this list. I have revisited it multiple times, and every time I find a new insight I didn’t pick up before. Waitzkin has thought deeply and internalized several principles on learning and performance at the highest levels through his experience as a child chess master, world champion Tai Chi Push Hands competitor, top tier Brazilian Jiu Jitsu trainer, and a coach for the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. At times bordering on the mystical and opaque, you have to do your own share of the work with this book. Rather than concrete, actionable strategies, this book deals in fundamental principles that are relevant no matter the strategy you choose: which can be frustrating at times, but is more rewarding and useful in the long run.

  <b>By Nassim Nicholas Taleb</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  Another book that doesn’t present easy, pre-digested material. We’ve talked about it somewhat extensively before. While there are a few specific how to’s scattered throughout, such as approaches to diet and exercise, it is far more useful as a foundational text on how to think about uncertainty. It’s another book where I find something new and get smarter every time I revisit it.

  <b>By Robert Pirsig</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  The only novel on this list, but don’t let that fool you - it’s still loaded to the gills with insight and useful introspective tools. This book was one of the first to seriously shake my arrogant belief that I understood myself deeply or even what “self” means. I agree with more of it every time I come back to it, and it has also been my personal bridge between stoicism and eastern philosophy - a more compatible pairing than you might think.

  </p>

  <p>
  The shortest book here, it punches way over its weight. I first read it cover to cover on an hour long flight and it lit my mind on fire. If you have anything remotely creative inside you trying to get out, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It is uncomfortable and galvanizing at the same time - like a cold shower, you will flinch from it at first, but emerge ready to take on the world. It is medicine I take whenever I find myself getting lazy and complacent.

  <p>
  A quick note on translations: these last two books were obviously not written in English, and the translation you select will have a big impact on what you think of it - generally stay away from
  the free Kindle editions, as these tend to be old, public domain translations of mediocre quality. If you want to get into the nitty gritty of why I chose these translations, shoot me an email and we can geek out.
  </p>

  <p>
  My personal favorite work of stoic philosophy, it barely edged out Marcus Aurelius for my token Stoic book. Stoicism is such a central part of my personal philosophy that I could have easily chosen nothing but stoic books. Here’s a good overview of stoicism generally, but at the core of it are three men, each impressive in his own way: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.  While I appreciate all of them, turns out I’m a Seneca guy. It is shocking how modern and relevant his 2,000 year old letters feel. Writing to a young friend and protege, Seneca’s advice has the wisdom and clarity of an older mentor who has been there, wishes he had done better, and now advises his young friend to learn from his experience. Friendly, worldly, but with an unceasing dedication to living a good life, these letters are good for you.

  </p>

  <p>
  Based on the rest of the list, this may come as something of a surprise entry, but I find the myths in it both beautiful and meaningful. The Germanic myths lack the neat and tidy systemization imposed on Greek myth, leaving them with a raw vitality and tantalizingly missing pieces. With all my focus on rational stoicism and conscious improvement, I find it useful to remember the murkier subconscious parts of my mind that can only be accessed through stories of gods, monsters, and magic. Plus they’re viking myths so they’re super metal. If you’re still not convinced and insist on directly useful, you’ll find fewer collections of wisdom poetry more straightforward than the Havamal. 
  </p>

  <p>
  I know that there’s quite a lot to read here, but these are special and well worth the time. I encourage you to pick just one new book and give it a go today. It just might change your life.

  I started reading this book because I've encountered the idea of managing "energy" in several places, and I wanted an adequate description to work with. This book did not disappoint. As I read, I kept thinking "this reminds me of Josh Waitzkin's advice in The Art of Learning", so I went back and checked, and sure enough, he trained with the authors. While the physical and emotional energy stuff is useful, I found this work's definition of  "spiritual" as "caring about something larger than yourself beyond your own self-interest" to be the most straightforward and practical definition I've encountered. A lot of ideas from this book have been incorporated elsewhere, but it's full of specific case studies and examples of how the concepts have been applied in a variety of situations. Great stuff.

  I've been wanting to read this book ever since listening to James Altucher's <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/podcast/steven-johnson/">interview with the author</a> and it did not disappoint. Wide ranging and diverse in the best possible way, this book draws on examples as diverse as the building of coral reefs and the founding of YouTube to elucidate the components of systems that most reliably produce useful innovation - whether in nature, science, or business. I would have liked just a hair more advice on how to operationalize the concepts, but as a foundation for thinking about hard problems that matter, this book was invaluable.

  This book came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine at work and it certainly did not disappoint. It focuses on questions of how objects in our environment can enhance (or detract) from our experience and our lives. Most useful to me was the distinction between <i>affordances</i> and <i>signifiers</i> and the notion of "knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world." If you're even a little bit interested in how the objects, structures, and organizations around you shape your life in subtle ways, you'll thoroughly enjoy this.

  I'm not gonna lie to you, friends: I was pretty skeptical of this system when I first heard about it at work. One of my business school professors engrained a deep distrust of "personality types" in general by pointing out that almost all of them except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">The Big Five</a> lack any rigorous empirical testing. That being said, as I read this book, time and again I saw descriptions that rang extremely true for either myself or my loved ones. It's probably easy to take this too far and use it as some kind of universal theory, but it makes an awfully useful heuristic for understanding why you act the way you do, and more importantly, why other people act in such seemingly incomprehensible ways.

  <b>Date</b> 2017-June-16
  </p>

  <p>
  <a href="#rethinking_risk_with_antifragile">Last time</a>, we discussed a new way of looking at the concept of “risk” and our inability to scientifically define it. Today, we go a little deeper and break systems into three categories based on their exposure to volatility: fragile, robust, and antifragile.
  </p>

  <p>
  First we need to realize that volatility, time, and risk are really the same thing. This sounds bizarre, right? But let’s return to our <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rationality.pdf">least-worst definition of risk</a>: “exposure to negative outcomes brought about by volatility." With this in mind, we can see that given enough time, every possible extreme of volatility will be experienced. To return to our coffee mug example, if you leave that mug on a table in San Francisco, eventually an earthquake will knock it off and break it. So, the combination of its exposure to negative outcomes (falls make it break) plus time (eventually something will happen to knock it off) means that more time equals more likely that it is broken. I should point out, of course, that this concept is statistical and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical">empirical</a> in nature, which has three important implications: 1)it is only really valid probabilistically, 2) it can’t predict the outcome for any one single thing, and 3) it makes no theory-based claims as to why time will eventually break most coffee mugs. 
  </p>

  <p>
  We now know that exposure is the most practical thing to care about, since it definitely matters and we can actually observe it. Contrast this with the other elements of “risk” usually considered - the timing or intensity of the outcomes concerned, which we can’t every really know ahead of time. WIth our focus squarely on exposure, we can now look at how to categorize systems based on exposure, and It turns out that there are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile. The first two will be familiar and intuitively obvious, but this last category is novel and thus gives Taleb’s book its name. Let’s go through what each category means and give some examples.
  </p>

  <p>
  Fragile things are hurt by volatility - eventually something goes wrong and they break. The easy example we’ve been using is the coffee mug. An important concept that we’ve skipped over so far is that these categories are defined by their relationship with volatility, which can be changed by circumstances - it’s not an intrinsic quality, even though some things more inherently tend towards fragility than others. 
  </p>

  <p>
  To understand this distinction, I like to think about <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy">potential energy</a>. A brick sitting on top of a ladder has more potential energy than one sitting on the ground. Nothing about the brick changes except its relationship with the gravity well it’s sitting in. Likewise, with our coffee mug, if you wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuffed it in a box, put that box in a waterproof bag, then put that inside a nuke proof bunker filled with packing peanuts, it would be significantly less fragile than sitting on your coffee table, which is less fragile still than balancing on top of a stack of books as you try to open a door.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most relevant real world examples are traditional stocks and artificial systems that are overly optimized. Sure, traditional stocks go up when volatility goes in their favor, but they go down when it goes down, and you need <a href="http://www.360financialliteracy.org/Topics/Budgeting-Spending/Budgeting-and-Saving/Understanding-the-Math-of-Recovering-from-Losses">bigger growth to offset your loss</a>. Highly optimized systems, on the other hand, work great until they catastrophically don’t. These failures are usually due to an unforeseen change in environmental circumstance or an excess of predicted capacity. Traffic is a great example. Highways don’t get linearly slower as cars are added during rush hour - they go from zooming to standstill exponentially quickly as their capacity is exceeded. If you like guns, think about the (somewhat exaggerated) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16">difference between an M16 and an AK-47</a>: an M16 is more accurate and generally higher functioning, but stops working after much less abuse than the less optimized, cruder AK.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, the AK-47 can be described as “more robust” or “less fragile” than the M16. Robust is usually considered the opposite of fragile, but that’s not quite accurate. Robust things are indifferent to volatility - shit happens and they abide. Volatility neither particularly hurts nor particularly helps them. Think of <a href="http://s1.thingpic.com/images/u3/z7gW8yQ1gQAjKqq9Vmgcf47e.jpeg">Notre Dame</a> in Paris - through centuries of wars, invasions, and revolutions, it has remained beautiful and solid and standing. Sure it’s a little rougher around the edges, but it’s not a pile of rubble. Nor is it larger or more beautiful or superior in some way. It simply is.
  </p>

  <p>
  When it comes to examples of increasing robustness in day to day life, I like to think about my finances and my schedule. As I mentioned before, I keep somewhat large cash savings around, because it makes me more indifferent to volatility. I can pay for the unexpected without indebting myself or scrambling around. Likewise, when scheduling, I build in buffers of time (a trick I originally learned in the army) so that if something unexpected happens (major accident on the freeway, a train stops traffic, there’s a marathon I didn’t know about - whatever) I still get there on time. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, we get to the star of the show, the most novel category: antifragile, the true opposite of fragile. Antifragile systems actually benefit from volatility - eventually something will happen that makes them better or stronger. These systems are most often found in nature. Think of your immune system: once you have chicken pox, you’re immune. Or your muscles: lift weights and you get stronger. Most interesting of all, look at evolution: species and even ecosystems get more efficient and better adapted to their environment over time by responding to the various stressors that come up due to volatility.
  </p>

  <p>
  Because this is exciting and sounds like a super power, everyone immediately thinks “how can I be more antifragile?” Well, there’s good and bad news. First off, the bad news is that it is more applicable to systems than to individual entities. The good news is that we create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">systems</a> in our life constantly, and we can engineer those to be as antifragile as possible. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Taleb became wealthy by betting against the market with out of the money put options - when the financial crisis hit and the market tanked, those options paid off. He had no precise knowledge of when a crash would happen or how big it would be, but given enough time it would. So he constructed a system with <a href="http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf">convex exposure</a> where he accepted finite, limited downside constantly for near unlimited upside in the event of volatility. 
  </p>

  <p>
  For ourselves, it helps to remember that robust is usually a necessary stepping stone to antifragile. Remember the savings we talked about? Step 1 is you don’t care about negative outcomes. Step 2 is to create ways to actively benefit from them - such as by buying undervalued stocks when there is <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp">“blood in the streets”</a> or setting up positions that automatically benefit like Taleb’s. Or you might find other ways that disorder in your life can benefit you - have something read or listen to whenever you find yourself unexpectedly delayed, for example. Another favorite of mine is to practice Jocko Willink’s habit of responding to all negative situations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8">“Good.”</a> Or perhaps, invest in business ideas that take advantage of the seemingly negative, like staffing agencies in a world of <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/quit-your-job-2017/">declining full time employment</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The basics of Taleb’s framework come pretty easy, but there is so much depth there. For example, I didn’t even touch the <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/taleb_n_1.html">math</a> behind it, because that’s not my forte. I promise that as you think about these concepts, you will begin seeing them in your life and trying to find ways to apply them. If you figure out anything interesting, please let me know!

  </p>

  <p>
  The core concept explored in this book is what is "risk" and how should we think about it in our lives, but it reaches out and touches so many more areas of interest. Taleb is shockingly smart, enjoyably contrarian, and writes in a very engaging way. This book is one of my top five life and brain changing books - you will be a little bit smarter every time you read it.

  <p>
  Risk fundamentally shapes some of our most critical decisions, but most of us don’t think very deeply or clearly about it. <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Taleb</a> is not like most of us. he has thought long, hard, and with great rigor about risk and randomness, and he presents that thinking most usefully and straightforwardly in Antifragile. That being said, while his writing and storytelling are superb, it’s not exactly light beach reading. Below we’re going to talk about just one of the many useful concepts presented in the book, which is a fundamentally different way to think about and evaluate risk.
  </p>

  <p>
  I’ve been listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/4orcemajeure/the-james-altucher-show-ep-45-nassim-taleb-why-you-should-embrace-uncertainty">his interview with James Altucher</a> recently, and I was surprised to realize I haven’t written about this book yet. You see, it lives on my shelf of “personal operating manuals” along with <i>Deep Work</i>, <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <i>Tools of Titans</i>, and a few others. I am pretty sure that <i>Antifragile</i> is the “80/20” book of his <i>Incerto</i> series - it covers the key concepts, ways to apply them to your life, and just enough of the underlying math to let you know it’s serious (there’s more in the appendix if that gets you going). 
  </p>

  <p>
  Understanding Antifragile requires rethinking the term “risk.” First off, Taleb asserts that there is no such thing as a satisfactory definition of “risk.” Risk as usually defined or described conflates three separate factors - the likelihood of an event, a party’s exposure to that likelihood, and how that party feels about that exposure. Usually you’ll see risk <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html">defined</a> as something like “the likelihood of a negative outcome times its severity.”
  </p>

  <p>
  One problem with this is that “negative outcome” and “severity” can vary enormously depending on the entity experiencing the event. If your coffee cup is knocked off the counter, it’s going to have a bad time. If your cat falls off the counter, it’ll be fine. In both cases the objective event (falling off the counter) is identical, but the entities experiencing it are differently exposed to negative outcomes. When you add in rational thought, you get the further wrinkle that “negative” is a judgment call. While you might think something like “losing money” is intrinsically negative, it’s not so simple. What if I lose money daily but get a huge payout once a year and I’m okay with that? Or what if I decide I’m okay losing the money to have a good time (like a Vegas trip)? 
  </p>

  <p>
  There’s an even thornier challenge besides those above, though: outside of certain fairly constrained bounds, we can’t even accurately model the likelihood of events (we think we can, but we’re very bad at it). Artificial environments that involve chance (like rolling dice or drawing cards) have relatively easy to model probabilities, as do large classes of natural phenomena that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-most-natural-phenomena-when-observed-randomly-tend-to-converge-to-a-normal-distribution-curve-If-so-can-this-be-used-as-a-hypothesis-to-claim-that-nature-follows-a-certain-pattern">fit pretty well</a> into normal distributions. But several classes of events that matter very much to our lives (financial instruments, catastrophic disasters, terrorist attacks, et cetera) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e6UKCJt-g8">cannot have their probability modeled in any meaningful, non-deceiving way</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  So where does that leave us for how to think about risk in our own lives? Well, the good news is that while we can’t really nail down a scientific definition of “risk” for the whole wide world, we can do just fine in assessing risk for ourselves. To do so, we need to look at two main factors: how we feel about the outcomes and our exposure to those outcomes taking place. For example, I would very much like to continue living and would find getting killed unambiguously negative. Certain activities, like smoking, riding motorcycles, or going to dangerous neighborhoods dramatically increase my exposure to the outcome of getting killed. I don’t have to have a good model of how likely or unlikely those outcomes are to simply avoid my exposure to that risk.
  </p>

  <p>
  In terms of personal finance, I keep a lot more cash savings than most investing professionals would advise, because savings help make me more robust - I can be more indifferent to the volatility of the world around me. Air conditioning stops working? Cool, I’ve got cash in the bank. Surprise! Nail in your tire - cash. You get the picture. Now, this works the other way as well - you can take some amount of money that you’re okay with losing and invest it in things with a low chance of paying off but with potentially unlimited returns, like out of the money options or start ups or your own entrepreneurial ventures. Taleb calls this the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/013114/barbell-investment-strategy.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads">“barbell method”</a> of investing, because he advocates having heavily safe and heavily risky investments, rather than an averaged portfolio like a business school finance class would teach you to go for.
  </p>

  <p>
  This may come as a shock to you, but I also find Tim Ferriss’s definition of risk instructive to combine here - he looks at risk by asking whether or not something irreversible and/or massively negative may happen. By using <a href="http://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/">fear setting</a> to mitigate what you can of the likelihood and alter your perception of the negatives, you will often find that very few actions have truly irreversible massive negative outcomes. This attitude can make it easier to expose yourself to the possible upsides of volatility, such as by encouraging you to build your own business or invest a prudent amount in a highly speculative company. 
  </p>

  <p>
  So how do you apply these concepts? We’ve talked about a few in our examples above, but here’s my top pics for most useful ways to re-think your approach to risk in your life:
  </p>

  <p>
  Career: Corporate jobs are generally viewed as “safe” because there is very little volatility in your paycheck. Until it’s totally gone. Maybe you get laid off, or maybe you happened to be working for Enron. If this happens when you’re 23, it’s not such a big deal, but if it happens right before retirement, it can be devestating. Compare this with a skilled individual worker or independent consultant, and their pay is much more variable day to day and month to month, but they have a much tighter feedback loop: as long as you keep getting clients, you’re doing something valuable. When you start losing your ability to find them, it’s a sign you need to move on and find a new gig. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Investing: Before we get into this, please bear in mind I am not an investment advisor of any sort, and this does not constitute specific financial advice - this paragraph is just a recommendation on where to look to learn more, not specific investment strategies. As mentioned above, a traditionally balanced portfolio basically says “let’s get rid of all the volatility except what’s inherent in the market.” The trouble is, there’s a whole damn lot of volatility inherent in the market, especially when you are looking only at equity. Much better to figure out however much money you need to not be ruined and protect it from volatility the best you can (Inflation-protected Treasuries or the like) and take whatever is left over and put it into things where you have exposure to the potential for massive upside - investing in your friend’s genius start up, opening a restaurant, writing a novel, out of the money options, whatever. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Health and Behavior: There are some things that can greatly affect our exposure to negative health outcomes - like the previously mentioned smoking or engaging in dangerous stunts. Many of these you can completely opt out of and face no risk - which is the approach recommended by Taleb. You’ll have to decide for yourself if a non-zero chance of horrible death is worth the benefits of doing things like motorcycle riding or sky diving. On the more positive side, doing things like lifting heavy weights and walking frequently have close to zero downside (some chance of injury with weight lifting), but potentially tremendous upside to your health long term. 
  </p>

  <p>
  This is just the tip of the iceberg with Taleb’s material, and I strongly recommend you check out not only Antifragile, but the rest of the Incerto series. We haven’t even gotten into just what “Antifragility” is, but I wanted to cover the basic approach to risk and provide some tangible ways to use it first. Let me know if you’re interested in diving deeper on this topic, and we’ll make a series of it.

  The core thesis of this book is that <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull/">goals are for losers, systems are for winners, and passion is bullshit</a>. When I finally got around to actually reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely jam packed with useful little nuggets. Seriously, this is one of the highest "actionable stuff to fluff" self-improvement books I've ever read. While it is full of specific tactics, the real value of this book is how it points out the complex system that leads to your energy, output, and ultimately success.

  I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but to be perfectly honest, I was worried it was one of those books where if you know the premise you don't need to read it. What I had overlooked is the degree to which making the case for checklists would motivate me to actually change my behavior. The examples given of lives saved and fortunes made through the seemingly simple expedient of using checklists are quite impressive. Plus, there's a neat checklist for creating your own checklist in the back.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to up your game to true professionalism in just about any field, check out this book.

  This book might seem out of left field for those of you outside of the military or law enforcement, but I think it has several valuable lessons for everybody. First off, it will help you to understand many of the dynamics going on - on both sides - of the deadly force encounters you hear about in the news. Secondly, it's breakdown of the physical, psychological, and environmental factors of the most extreme kind of stress can be reverse-engineered to the more mild kinds of stress most of us are lucky enough to deal with. Finally, it just might help you prepare for unlikely but terrible life-threatening situations.

  I've been a fan of Ferriss for years, but I think this book is far and away his best yet. It's chock full of great stuff that you can use right now to make your life better - whether to get healthy, make money, or feel more calm in your life. If you only ever read one book of his, make it this one. Hell, if you only read one self-improvement book period, make it this one.

  This book is a classic for a reason - I've taken my sweet ass time getting to it, but I am absolutely hooked. Drawing on a combination of scholarly experiments and "in the trenches" experience with sales training, this book points out thenearly automatic triggers we have evolved to be good, cooperative members ofsociety and how "compliance professionals" (salesmen, recruiters, and cons) use these techniques to get their way without you even knowing what they're about. This book is doubly valuable - you learn how to spot unscrupulous applications of the techniques as well as how to use them in your own (hopefully legitimate) endeavors. For lots of interesting extra context, check out Scott Adams's <a href="http://goldmine.marketing/scott-adams-original-persuasion-reading-list-from-2016/">Persuasion Reading List</a>.

  By now, you've probably heard about how bad sitting is for you, and maybe you've even seen or used a standing desk somewhere. Well, this book lays down the case for why sitting is literally killing us in stark, terrifying detail, and proceeds to provide specific, step by step instructions on how to do something about it. It's not as simple as buying a standing desk and burning your chair - you have to re-teach your body appropriate ways of moving after years oflearning the wrong thing. Fortunately, the prescriptions in this book are easy to follow and will give you immediate relief as well as long-lasting solutions to problems like stiff backs, joint pain, and chronic stress.

  <b>By: Sam Harris</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  In this book, Harris makes a case for spiritual practice without the scaffolding and foundation of religious beliefs. While he approaches it as an avowed and enthusiastic atheist, I think that the core insight that there are certain practices you can adopt to bring peace, contentment, and compassion into your life without adopting beliefs you are uncomfortable with is useful regardless of your religious convictions. The descriptions of what it feels like to meditate and what it feels like to think you're meditating when you aren't really are worth the price of admission by themselves.
