      <p>
      We've now gone over what I believe to be the weightiest things to take away from
      <i>Decline of the West</i>: looking at history and cultures <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">morphologically</a>, thinking
      about cultures as if they are <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">living thing</a>, and the thought that each culture is
      defined by its <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_3_the_soul_image">"Soul Image"</a>. I thought about wrapping up this series there, but
      these two weighty tomes have a <i>lot</i> of stuff to them, and I think there's a few
      more things worth getting from the books. I'm working these posts out as I go,
      so I'm not sure how many more we'll have, but for today, at least, we've got
      more Spengler to dive into. This time we're going to talk about two key
      distinctions he makes throughout the book and the general idea that underlies
      both of them: time versus destiny, and space versus motion. With these, Spengler
      gets darn near <i>metaphysical</i>, so let's dig in.
      </p>
      </div>
      </li>

      <li><a id="orgbe4e648"></a>Time and Destiny - What Happened against What to Do<br />
      <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe4e648">
      <p>
      Spengler talks often about the difference between "time" and "destiny." This is
      one of those steads where he speaks very emphatically and kind of assumes you
      know what he means, but he mostly just gestures at examples of the distinction
      and says "see? This what I'm talking about." The best way I can think to put it
      is that time is what you perceive when you look back over events and make sense
      of what happened when, whereas destiny is the feeling of being in the moment or
      looking ahead and being aware that things change. Time is the purview of the
      historian, the dry content of stories of what came before. Destiny is the
      purview of the man of action - it's the feeling that things will not last, that
      you can change their course, and the world might be some other way than what it
      is now. Spengler talks about how folks of different classes tend to feel more of
      one or more of the other, but also how during different phases of a Culture's
      lifecycle, one way or the other tends to be more widespread. Time is farthest
      from Destiny when it is treated as a measurable quantity, merely one more kind
      of distance.
      </p>

      <p>
      In fact, Spengler argues that the very idea of "cause and effect" is an artifact
      of a rationalizing/systematizing way of looking at Time. You can only clearly
      identify cause and effect <i>after</i> the event, as you think about what happened as a
      sequence of episodes, rather than the fluid, organic flow of one thing happening
      into another. Now, obviously, Spengler doesn't mean that you can't take an
      action because you know or suspect what outcome it will bring, but this is from
      past experience. To the degree that it's automatic (you move your hand to where
      the ball will be to catch it), you're not really thinking in terms of cause and
      effect - you have a goal and you do what you need to do to get it. You don't
      have to understand the ballistics of the ball mathematically to do that. On the
      other hand, if you <i>are</i> reasoning about cause and effect consciously, in advance,
      you're really doing two things, both of which are backward-looking. First, you
      are drawing on facts about the world that you know, whether from experience,
      book learning, or whatever, and comparing them to this situation. Secondly, you
      are imagining the end state and then asking "what would it take for me to be
      there instead of here?" So you are looking backward in your imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let's get <i>real</i> weird and mix our Spengler with a little pop culture. This
      example is <i>perfect</i>, but you may or may not know it. In the surprisingly-great
      cartoon show <i>Gravity Falls</i>, one of the main characters, a 12 year old boy named
      Dipper, has an enormous crush on a cool older girl, Wendy. There's a party at
      the funky tourist trap they both work at (Dipper's uncle runs the place is why
      he's working as a 12 year old). Dipper, being the nerdy reasoning type comes up
      with a plan with literal numbered steps about how he will talk to Wendy and get
      her to like him. The show being what it is, this leads to hilarious paranormal
      hijinks, and of course this ridiculous plan doesn't work, but in the midst of
      it, Dipper runs into Wendy while they're both waiting to go to the bathroom, and
      they just talk, and it goes great. When Dipper tried to plan every step, to know
      what would happen in what sequence and how long it would take, he was dealing
      with <i>Time</i>. When he just got out of his own way and acted like a normal human
      with the flesh and blood girl in front of him, he was dealing with <i>Destiny</i>
      </p>

      <p>
      So, to bring it back to Spengler, he believed that early in a Culture's
      lifecycle, it is more caught up with Destiny, and less worried about Time.
      Later, during the Civilization phases, Time comes to dominate. I should likely
      stress that Spengler doesn't say that either is <i>better</i>, though you always kind
      of get the impression he finds Destiny more appealing and mourns living in an
      age where no one can avoid thinking more about Time than Destiny. He also felt
      that men concerned with Life (the capital L is in the text), with shaping the
      world to their will, tend to feel Destiny more keenly, whereas eggheads, bean
      counters, and scribblers (thinkers, merchants, and writers) tend to see the
      world through the lens of Time.
      </p>
      </div>
      </li>

      <li><a id="org5537a61"></a>Space and Motion - Where to Move Through against What Even Is "Moving"<br />
      <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5537a61">
      <p>
      Okay, I've got to come clean here - this one has been tough for me to get my
      head around, and I'm not wholly sure I'm there yet. Spengler believed that a
      Culture's <i>Depth-Feeling</i>, the way it experienced the physical space around it,
      and the fact that some things are closer and some things are farther, was one of
      the main drivers of their <i>World-Feeling</i>, which is expressed by the <i>Soul-Image</i> we
      talked about last time. He says that the Faustian obsession with far-off point
      on the horizon, always visible, always receding, comes from the experience of
      both mighty, towering trees in the forests of northern and western Europe, and
      also from the plains of central Europe. The obsession with what is <i>right here</i>
      that I can <i>touch</i> held by the Apollonian culture was born of tiny islands and a
      craggy peninsula, where your entire life might be lived in a physical space that
      you can see all of from most vantage points. The Magian "great dome" is rooted
      in the experience of the roof of stars in piercing brilliance stretched over the
      clear, desert night.
      </p>

      <p>
      In other words, Spengler believed that different Cultures <i>feel</i> "space" very
      differently, and that the way folks in the modern West think of "space" is very
      much shaped by the Faustian Depth- and World-Feelings, and our understanding of
      "motion" even more so (more on that in a moment). The way that we think of
      "space" as a fixed, abstract dimension, as if we are moving around in a
      three-axis Cartesian plot with coordinates around an origin, is <i>deeply</i> rooted in
      how Faustian culture experiences the world around it. Scholars of the Apollonian
      Culture would likely have found such thoughts strange. Artistically, Western
      culture is the <i>only one ever</i> to come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">linear vanishing-point perspective</a>,
      because to Renaissance artists (firmly Faustian in Spengler's mind, fooling
      themselves about how "Classical" they were), that was just "how the world
      looked", but to artists from other cultures is just <i>did not</i> look that way, or to
      whatever degree it did, that was not what was <i>important</i> to represent
      two-dimensionally.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now, if Motion is understood as objects changing location in Space, then you can
      see that how a Culture sees Space can't help but shape its understanding of
      Motion. Newton's expression of Motion as forces acting upon mass in space
      obviously has a lot to recommend it - look at what the West has done with this
      model! But it turns out that "force" is kind of a weird, tricky idea to actually
      pin down, and a bunch of physicists since have tried to find ways of
      understanding motion that don't require it. Spengler says that Newton was
      expressing some pretty fundamental ideas about what the world is and how it
      works that were deeply rooted in the Faustian psyche. I'm not gonna lie to you,
      Marge: I don't wholly get what Spengler means here, so let's let the man speak
      for himself:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>
      Newton, a deeply religious nature, was only bringing the Faustian world-feeling
      to expression when, to elucidate the words "force" and "motion," he said that
      masses are points of attack for force and carriers for motion. So the
      thirteenth-century Mystics had conceived of God and his relation to world.
      Newton no doubt rejected the metaphysical element in his famous saying
      "<i>hypotheses non fingo</i> [I contrive no hypotheses]," but all the same he was
      metaphysical through and through in the founding of his mechanics. <i>Force is the
      mechanical Natures-picture of Western man; what Will is to his soul-picture and
      infinite Godhead in his world-picture</i>. The primary ideas of this physics stood
      firm long before the first physicist was born, for they lay in the earliest
      religious world-consciousness of our Culture.
      </p>
      </blockquote>

      Spengler, O. (2020). <i>Decline of the West, Volume I: Form and Actuality</i>. Arktos.
      Page 517. Emphasis in the original.
      </p>

      <p>
      Right now, my main takeaway is that when you are living in Destiny, rather than
      time, you don't really give much heed to "motion" as a <i>thing</i> - you just notice
      what the moving things around you are doing and what it means to you (grab this,
      dodge that, dance with her, run from him, and so forth). When you stop and try
      to work out what's "really" happening there, you have to have some sense of
      Space as a thing that can be measured, and Time as a thing that can be measured,
      and those are both deeply rooted in your Culture's worldview, so the science
      your culture invents will be shaped by those, likely at a way-down-deep level
      where you don't even notice it. In the same chapter that the above quote is
      from, Spengler argues that a Culture's "Nature-knowing" (what we call science
      these days) thinks that it is an objective study of what's "out there," but that
      it might be better understood as an extremely sophisticated way for a culture to
      come to understand itself.

      <li><a id="org83f921d"></a>Closing - What to Do With These Thoughts?<br />
      <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org83f921d">
      <p>
      As you can see, these thoughts are maybe less <i>directly</i> helpful in making sense
      of the world than the big ones we've touched on in earlier posts. That being
      said, if you <i>are</i> intrigued by Spengler's way of looking at the world and you'd
      like to apply some of his tools, these are where we start to get specific enough
      to start doing some original analysis. Say you want a "Spenglerian" take on a
      Culture he doesn't get much into, like the pre-Columbian Mesoamericans, or
      China, or India. Here's where to start - what kind of Destiny called its men of
      action to do their great deeds? How did its natural philosophers come to think
      about Time? What Depth-Feeling shaped their sense of Space? How did they
      conceive of objects moving through that Space?
      </p>

      <p>
      The other big thing that is helpful about these thoughts is that they make <i>very</i>
      clear that the things we take for granted, stuff that we assume are "objective
      facts about the universe" are, instead, models. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22">"The Map is Not the Territory."</a>
      <i>Every</i> understanding of the world involves some amount of abstraction - taking
      heed of some things about the world and leaving others out. The world is too big
      and weird for us to do otherwise. Spengler gives a wealth of examples to really
      disabuse you of the likely lingering feeling that "yeah, okay, I know, they're
      all models, but this one is <i>basically</i> how it really is, right?"
      </p>

      <p>
      As I said many times above, I'm not wholly happy with my understanding of these
      thoughts, so we may come back to them, and I'd welcome any thoughts, add-ons, or
      fixes.

  <p>
  Okay, so last time I put forth that Spengler's thought that Cultures are best
  looked at as living beings that have a common lifecycle that can be found out by
  looking at many cultures morphologically was the single biggest and most helpful
  thought in these big, fat books. Today, I want to talk about what comes in a
  very close second - the "Soul Image" (though Spengler talks about the same thing
  in a few ways throughout the books, this is the term in the Table of Contents,
  and so I'm treating it as the "most official." No idea what words he uses in
  German for the same thought). If the thought behind <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_2_culture_as_organism">Culture as Organism</a> is to
  look at the ways in which Cultures across time and space are <i>alike</i>, the Soul
  Image is meant to tell us the ways that they are <i>unalike</i>. This might be
  Spengler's <i>most</i> touchy-feely, qualitative, hard-to-prove, easy-to-argue concept
  in his whole mighty tome, but it is also the beating heart of said tome. You
  either run into this idea and go "oh wow, yeah, that is so right!" or else you
  recoil from it as unprovable, judgmental hogwash. Sounds fun, right? Let's jump
  in.
  </p>

  <p>
  Spengler believed that what made a Great Culture a Great Culture was that the
  folks who made it up had some deeply felt sense about what the world is like and
  what someone alive in it ought to do about that. He further believed that this
  sense was shaped by the lands that gave rise to these Cultures - an Egyptian
  tending his fields after the yearly flood of the Nile has enriched them is going
  to understand the world and its workings rather unlike the way that a German
  peasant who had to cut his field out of a deep, dark, and gnarly wood is going
  to, and neither of them will much see the world like a Mongolian herder rounding
  up his sheep on the vast steppe. The land, the turnings of the year, the
  weather, the plants and beasts that make up the background to life will all lead
  to folks thinking about the world and what it's like in ways that don't look
  much like each other. How do we know? Well, take a look at the art they make,
  the buildings they build, the music they make, and so forth. In other words,
  look at their <i>culture</i>, in the sense that the word meant before the
  anthropologists got a hold of it and gave it a broader and more universal
  meaning. Spengler had no truck with that - to him, "primitive" people didn't
  have "culture" - that was reserved for the folks who went out and did <i>great</i>
  things and made <i>art</i>. I never said the guy wasn't a snob, but he was at least a
  very well-trained snob.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, this is all rather abstract, so let's try to look at some of the Soul
  Images Spengler talks about. For the Classical or Apollonian Culture (Greeks and
  Romans), the Soul Image was the perfect human body, right <i>here</i>, defined
  tangible, in a particular place. For the Middle Eastern or Magian (from ~200-100
  BCE or so), it is sitting within a great dome, whether a cave, the roof of a
  tent, or the night sky in the desert, placed there by an all-powerful and
  personally involved creator. For the Western or Faustian Culture (European from
  ~500 CE), the Soul Image is the idea of chasing an ever-receding point in
  infinite space - the distant goal on the horizon or the point where all the
  trees in the forest seem to come together in the sky. Spengler speaks a bit
  about the Egyptian, Chinese, Indian, and Mesoamerican Soul Images, but he knew
  these Cultures and their histories less well and they had less direct bearing on
  his Europe and where it might be going. His thought is that each of these Soul
  Images is the deeply felt sense of something deep and weighty, something that
  stirs the soul, but that is ever so hard to truly say or show someone - that's
  why it takes a Culture over a thousand years to wear out the artistic,
  architectural, and philosophical possibilities of that Soul Image and settle
  into rehashing what has come before during the Civilization bit of the
  lifecycle.
  </p>

  <p>
  Spengler believed that someone from a given Culture could not help but see the
  world through its Soul Image, and on the flip side, could not <i>truly</i> understand
  how folks from another Culture saw the world or what their Soul Image was all
  about. Oh sure, you could come to understand it intellectually, but it would
  never be deeply <i>felt</i> as "just how things are" the way it would be for a native
  of the culture. A crude analogy from my own experience: if you are a Millenial
  or a Gen Xer, chances are pretty good that you marked the coming of Anime to the
  United States. In the 80s, a handful of deeply weird and often very bloody films
  found their way into odd pockets of US popular culture, and a few more shows
  were carefully localized and cleaned up for American audiences and presented
  without their Japaneseness being highlighted (like <i>Robotech</i>). In the 90s, this
  picked up a bit, and you started finding American folks who were into "Anime" as
  a genre/subculture/fandom/whatever - my cool older friend showed me a fan sub of
  <i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i> that his college Anime Club had put together
  when he was home for the summer. By the early 2000's, the makers of mainstream
  American animation had recognized a hot fad and wanted to get in on the action.
  The result was a stream of American-made cartoons that sloppily and awkwardly
  aped not only the visual style of Anime (which was itself a Japanese
  re-interpretation of Disney animation, originally), but also attempted to bring
  in bits of Japanese culture or tropes (like the giant sweat drop in frame to
  show a character's embarrassment, or a guy getting a nosebleed because he's so
  turned on by a girl). The worst were the attempts to copy Japanese humor. The
  Americans making this stuff <i>kinda-sorta</i> understood what anime was doing, and
  they recognized something appealing, but they did not <i>grok it in fullness</i>, and
  the results were often cringeworthy. By the 2010s, most folks involved in and
  interested in animation had worked out ways to take the stuff from anime that
  was most amenable to American culture and more smoothly incorporate it, and you
  didn't get as much stuff faking being Japanese.
  </p>

  <p>
  Maybe this example doesn't resonate with you, but I'm sure that you can think of
  examples of (popular) culture where folks from one Culture have tried to imitate
  an artform, trope, style, or way of being from another Culture, and the results
  have been hilariously <i>off</i>. Spengler called such attempts to adopt the Soul Image
  of another Culture <i>pseudomorphosis</i>. The term comes from geology. Imagine a
  formation of limestone surrounded by another, harder rock. Over time, the
  limestone is eroded away by water, leaving a limestone-shaped and textured
  hollow. Then, some magma flows into this space and fills it like metal cast into
  a mold. You now have a formation that has the outward appearance of limestone,
  but the composition of an igneous rock. This is an igneous rock that has
  undergone a <i>pseudomorphosis</i>, which is Greek for "false shaping." Spengler makes
  <i>much</i> use of this metaphor in understanding history and to explain why the
  Cultures he sees, and the lifecycle he propounds for them, have not been more
  obvious to others. Spengler saw pseudomorphosis when a Culture (usually younger
  and with less worldly power) runs into another Culture and for one reason or
  another tries to adopt artistic, architectural, or intellectual styles from the
  other Culture, but in the process, can't help but apply its own Soul Image.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of Spengler's more provocative assertions is that the usual understanding of
  "Western Culture" is mistaken, and is, in fact, a series of successive Cultures
  given a false sense of continuity through pseudomorphoses. You had the
  Classical/Apollonian Culture, which hardened into a Civilization by the
  Hellenistic era, meaning that most of what we remember about Rome was also in
  the Civilization phase, then as that Civilization was crumbling, the young,
  vigorous Middle Eastern/Magian Culture took on a Classical pseudomorphosis,
  giving us "Late Antiquity," the early Christian Church, and the Byzantine
  Empire. And lastly, the Magian-wearing-Classical-Clothes church then provided a
  pseudomorphosis for the aborning Western/Faustian culture in the late Dark
  Ages/Early Medieval period, with a more conscious and direct Classical
  pseudomorphosis in the Renaissance. In other words, the great continuity of the
  "Western Canon" taught in universities until rather recently, from Homer through
  Faulkner, was seen by Spengler as glossing over real and important transitions
  and changes in worldview.
  </p>

  <p>
  As I said near the top of this post, Spengler's argument rests on a lot of
  subjective, qualitative judgment, which many folks immediately take as
  "therefore not valid." But heimjunge built those subjective, qualitative
  judgments on a <i>lot</i> of knowledge of the Culture(s) at hand, and so it's worth at
  least taking the assertion seriously as a point to consider. One example of what
  I mean that's relevant to some of the other interests I blog about: the
  "Neoplatonists" like Plotinus and Iamblichus were philosophers/religious figures
  of the 3rd Century CE. Most historians see these as straightforwardly
  late-Classical members of the Hellenistic world, heirs to the clearly Classical
  Plato that their name implies. Not so Señor Spengler. He says that if you
  actually read what Neoplatonists believed, it seems to have a lot more in common
  with the mostly-monotheistic beliefs of the Middle Eastern/Magian world, and
  shares their concern with spelled-out ethical systems, rather than the Classical
  focus on the individual and his excellence. In other words, Spengler argues that
  the Neoplatonists are <i>truly</i> Magian, but undergoing a Classical pseudomorphosis.
  Likewise, most folks see the Christian Church as an element of continuity
  between the late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. Spengler instead points out
  how <i>very</i> unalike the faith of the Desert Fathers with its asceticism and strict
  monotheism was from medieval Catholicism with its panoply of saints and great
  focus on Mary - again, he sees European Catholicism as a Faustian religious
  expression under a Magian pseudomorphosis.
  </p>

  <p>
  I find the idea of pseudomorphosis, along with the foundational idea that
  different cultures <i>really are</i> deeply different, a helpful one, but I don't take
  it quite as far as Spengler did. Splengler thought that folks from different
  cultures could never <i>truly</i> understand the world in the same way, and that when
  one Culture took something from another, it was only ever a shallow imitation.
  To his mind, the Hagia Sophia was <i>truly</i> Magian and the fact that it borrowed
  Classical architecture was a diminishment or misdirection of that underlying
  Soul Image. Likewise the cathedrals of Europe - to the degree that they used
  Classical or Magian models, they were obfuscating the Faustian spirit trying to
  express itself through them. To some degree, I'm sure that Spengler was
  overreacting to the default position of absolute continuity from (at least)
  Greece through to the modern West that was popular in his day. He also might
  have been overstating his case either for rhetorical effect, or from the usual
  attachment we form with our best-loved ideas. Whatever the case, I think
  Spengler took too hard of a line.
  </p>

  <p>
  I think the true picture is more complicated (and more interesting). For one
  thing, there are some elements of <i>deep</i> cultural continuity that we know about -
  for example, did you know that some fairy tales go back to at least the ice age?
  Or how about the fact that until very recently, anywhere from Ireland to India,
  it was assumed that a woman would take her husband's name when they got
  married - that has its roots in proto-Indo-European cultural practice. So, for
  Spengler to argue that <i>everything</i> the West got from the Apollonian or Magian
  cultures was "false" in some sense strikes me as far fetched. The Neoplatonism
  mentioned above comes to mind - though surely we understand it differently today
  than did Plotinus, and he was likely farther from Plato than he might have
  thought, there's a common thread of understanding the world uniting nearly 2500
  years of thinkers, and that's pretty cool.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0aa5d35">
  <p>
  <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#understanding_spengler_s_decline_of_the_west_bit_1">Last time</a>, we talked about Spengler's use of <i>morphology</i> to understand history and identify parallels between different Cultures at different times. Today, I'd like to talk about why he chose a biological metaphor and what he got from it. Maybe <i>the</i> key takeaway from <i>The Decline of the West</i> is the thought that Great Cultures/Civilizations are best thought of as <i>living things</i> that are born, grow up, show certain hallmarks, and after some time, grow old and die - just like you, me, and every other man, beast, and plant on earth. I don't know whether Spengler had the insight that Cultures are like living things and so pulled out the morphology, or if his use of the morphological way of understanding things led him to the thought that Cultures are best seen as living things. Either way, the two thoughts are very closely linked, and so I had some trouble working out which to speak to first, or even whether they ought to be two posts of their own, or put together into one. As you can clearly see, I went with two posts of their own, with "morphology" coming first, and now onto the lifecycle of Cultures. I thought that the lifecycle would be easier to talk about if we had the shared understanding of morphology that the last post hopefully brought about, and so now here we are.

  <li><a id="orgd29d7d2"></a>"Culture" against "Civilization" - Phases in the Lifecycle<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd29d7d2">
  <p>
  First off, a bit of terminology that might be confusing if you have bumped into Spengler's thoughts, but not read his book. He talks about Cultures and Civilizations (the capital letters are used to make it clear we're talking about a specific concept here). I have heard that the German words <i>Kultur</i> and <i>Zivilisation</i> might have connotations closer to what Spengler meant in his work, but I don't speak German, and so I can't quite say. Instead, let me explain what I understand from the translation. When Spengler speaks of a "Culture," he does not mean just some group of folks with a shared way of being in the world, the way your Cultural Anthropology professor might. Instead, he means a group of folks with a <i>very particular</i> insight into the world (a "World Image," which we'll talk about more next time), that are in the midst of doing great things to explore that insight and try to make it manifest through art, writing, politics, and ways of living - everything that a modern English speaker would call (note the little 'c') "culture." A "Civilization," on the other hand, is what a Culture <i>turns into</i> when it has exhausted itself in exploring its particular way of looking at the world and instead just uses that way of looking at the world to get material things done, like conquering other folks who don't have their stuff quite as together. In Spengler's way of looking at things, Cultures are young, vibrant, alive, messy, and creative. Civilizations, on the other hand, are old, stodgy, dead, orderly, and derivative. We're going to talk more about this lifecycle as we go, but the most helpful bit to take away is the thought that Cultures are alive and fresh and still working things out, whereas Civilizations are (spiritually) old and tired, even if they are materially on top of the world. The example that most helps me is that Spengler placed the Classical Culture from roughly the Doric period (~1100 BCE) until Alexander (~323 BCE), and pretty much <i>all</i> of non-mythical Roman history was in its Civilization phase. One of the most interesting, most studied periods of human history, at least in the West, nearly 600 years, was all in the "dead" phase of Civilization.

  <li><a id="org1a93ee0"></a>Putting the Above Together<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a93ee0">
  <p>
  As you can see, Spengler had a few different ways of comparing Cultures/Civilizations. The toughest to fit together is the Spiritual Epochs with the other two, but roughly speaking, "Spring" is the Early Period of the Culture and "Summer" is the Late Period, and then the Civilization is split between "Autumn" and "Winter." The tables in the book list examples for each segment from different Cultures/Civilizations (Indian, Egyptian, Chinese, Classical, Arabian, and Western), to give a feeling of what he means by the labels I've copied above. There's a lot of terms that might be a bit head-scratching without Spengler's spelling them out in the work, like what he means by "Form" and so forth, but the general idea comes out pretty clearly: early on in a Culture, the folk have a way of seeing/understanding things that they just <i>have</i> to find a way to make real. This drives them to make all kinds of art and architecture and to come together into a political unit. Eventually, this unit solidifies and has command over great material resources, but has lost its ability to tap into deeper spiritual truths. 
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org240e549"></a>Where are We? Early Autumn<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org240e549">
  <p>
  So, according to Spengler, the West was moving into the "Early Autumn" or first phases of "Civilization" in the early 20th century, and so we're just a bit further along that curve here about 100 years later. So, we're maybe in the "Caesarism" phase politically (charismatic leaders use the love of the people to seize absolute power), we are somewhere in between rebelling against the artistic forms our Culture developed and emptily aping them, and our philosophical thinking is in the highly abstract phase. I don't know that I'd say this is <i>obviously</i> true, but it's hard to say it's impossible. Whether you agree with this placement or not, the thought that different Cultures/Civilizations follow different arcs, and that we might place our own by careful attention to the past is a useful one, and I hope you find the above tables fruitful in the exercise.

  </ul>

  <p>
  Last year, as part of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">"read only books by dead authors"</a> challenge, I read
  both Volumes of Oswald Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>. I found it very
  interesting and helpful, but it was not what you would call an easy read. So, I
  thought I'd spend a few posts doing my best to put forth the most helpful
  thoughts from the book in a way that might be a little more handy. Also, it will
  help me get those ways of looking at the world settled into my own head, so even
  if I don't succeed at the first, I'll at least have the other one going for me.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, in case you don't know, let's go over who Oswald Spengler is and what was
  his magnum opus. Spengler was a German thinker and writer with rather broad
  knowledge who lived and wrote around the turn of the 20th century. <i>The Decline
  of the West</i> was published in 1918 (first volume) and 1922 (the second). When
  first published, it made a huge stir, everyone educated was talking about it,
  responding to it, and arguing about it, but these days, you mostly only hear
  about him from folks with tastes in less mainstream takes on history. The core
  thesis of the book is that groups of humans (Cultures) have a distinctive
  lifecycle, like a living thing, this cycle includes growing old and dying, and
  that Western civilization is starting into that old age. You might assume from
  the publication date that this was just a reaction to WWI, but he actually
  completed volume I on the eve of the Great War, and for obvious reasons couldn't
  get it published until it was over.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before we talk about Spengler's view of history and the world, let's take a tick
  to think about why he's forgotten by most folks these days. The first reason you
  might have already guessed: he was a right wing German in the early 20th
  century, and that's not exactly a popular description these days. Spengler
  didn't much care for Hitler or the Nazis, but he <i>was</i> a German nationalist in the
  days before that got stamped out of the country hard. The second reason is that
  his theories deal with the differences between "races," another view of the
  world not so much in fashion these days. Interestingly, he thought that "race"
  had more to do with the land and culture and less to do with biology, but that's
  a nuance that most folks don't get to with him. The last reason I'd point out,
  though, might be the most interesting: massive cultural cognitive dissonance.
  What do I mean? Well, already in Spengler's day, but even more so today,
  "Progress" is the core tenet of faith in Western Culture. Everything has been
  getting better since as far back as we can look and will just keep getting
  better forever. "From the caves to the stars." Well, Spengler took a big ol'
  dump all over this way of looking at the world. So, his thinking was rejected by
  the culture as a whole, for being incompatible with its core beliefs. That's
  just what makes him so interesting and potentially useful, of course.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before we can dig into why he thought the West was/would be in decline, we have
  to understand Spengler's whole way of looking at the world. Spengler's
  intellectual hero was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He looked to Goethe as a model
  of how to understand the world - through science, history, literature, and best
  of all, through a well-rounded, holistic view that took all of these into
  account. This is a fundamentally <i>qualitative</i> way of understanding, and the West
  spent most of the years between Goethe's time and Spengler's working out how to
  understand as much of the world as possible <i>quantitatively</i>. Spengler respected
  what these approaches could do, and acknowledged a lot of discoveries that came
  out of them, but he felt that the mania for quantification had crowded out the
  qualitative approach that allows for truly <i>understanding</i> large, messy topics. It
  is due to this qualitative approach that <i>Decline of the West</i> is sometimes called
  "unscientific," but I would argue that it is instead scientific in an older
  way - eighteenth century philosophers would have recognized this work as plenty
  scientific, as it is based on a lot of careful empirical observation and drawing
  generalizations from those.
  </p>

  <p>
  One method of qualitative science that Spengler relies on extensively, in fact
  that provides the framework for the whole work, is <i>morphology</i>, and this is the
  bit of Spengler's thinking I'd like to focus on in this post. His approach in
  the book is to look at the various cultures of the world and throughout history
  as if each is a living being and to look at the structural elements of those
  beings. Let's take a tick to ground this in the field Spengler borrowed the
  approach from: biology. Let's say that you want to look at both domestic cows
  and wild buffalo and find out what's alike and what's not between them. You
  could go out in the field and watch some of both kinds of animals and take
  careful note of how they behave. You'd see some likenesses, like that both
  animals spend a lot of time grazing, gather in herds, and so forth, but you'd
  also see some differences - like the cows going into a barn when it got cold, or
  being herded around by a dog. This would be an ethological approach. On the
  other hand, you might bring one of each animal into the lab and start taking
  measurements. You might even cut them apart and start looking at their organs
  and bones, seeing how they're shaped, how they fit together, and how they're
  linked. This would be a morphological approach. Both ways give you an
  understanding of the animals, and you'd learn a lot of the same stuff from both,
  since you are still looking at the same animals, but you'd also learn some
  things from one approach and not the other.
  </p>

  <p>
  Most history might be thought of as "human ethology" - it focuses on the
  behavior of individuals and groups, what they did, when they did it, what kind
  of motivations they had, what consequences did they have to live with, and so
  forth. Spengler instead wanted to look at history morphologically - what are the
  "parts" of the history of different cultures, how are they structured, how do
  they fit together, and so forth. The idea is that if you see a period of history
  in both the ancient Mediterranean and in China where charismatic leaders ride a
  wave of approval from the masses into supreme leadership, well, the history of
  both cultures has the same "part," despite some differences, the same way you
  could morphologically recognize a wing in a bat and a bird and work out that
  they're functionally similar despite the differences.
  </p>

  <p>
  So Spengler surveyed the vast expanse of history that he was familiar with and
  looked for what was happening <i>structurally</i>. What he found was that each Great
  Culture he had knowledge of had similar "parts," those parts happened in the
  same order, and they had similar durations. Put all this together, and you have
  a "lifecycle" for the "organisms" that are human cultures. You can look at when
  a culture came together and started doing things its own distinct way, and then
  match up certain parallel developments with how long after the start they
  happen, and you start to see a common arc - early vigorous frothing as groups
  within the culture jockey with each other, coming together into the full
  flowering of its cultural viewpoint, then things start hardening and become more
  focused on material gain, and then you get a Civilization with a lot of nice
  things, still going through the motions of its more vigorous younger self, but
  not truly doing anything new, and eventually that falls apart, and at best, you
  have folks who claim the old identity, but they are a shadow of what they once
  were, likely under the influence of some other Culture/Civilization with more
  power.
  </p>

  <p>
  We're going to talk more about Spengler's cultural life cycle in some upcoming
  posts, but for now I want to focus on the method of morphology specifically. It
  takes some judgment - bat wings and bird wings both allow flight through the
  adaptation of super long "finger" bones, and so are pretty easy to rule as
  "morphologically similar." But what about insect wings? These are still
  structures that allow flight, but they are made of wholly different materials
  and function in a wholly different way. Whether you decide to rule them
  "morphologically similar" will have something to do with why you're examining
  these structures. If you're trying to understand how flight works at all, then
  identifying very different ways different living things have been able to make
  it happen might be useful, and counting all "wings" as "similar" might be
  worthwhile. On the other hand, if you're trying to identify how flight evolved
  in different groups, you might not even count bats and birds as "morphologically
  similar," because they are from such far apart branches of the tree of life and
  obviously evolved at different times in different ways. This brings us back to
  Spengler's qualitativeness - much of why he is called "unscientific" is because
  he makes a lot of judgments about what counts as "similar" - if you look at his
  theory and don't find it plausible, you might see it as him fitting facts to
  theory. In his defense, he was a <i>fantastically</i> well-educated polymath who really
  did know a hell of a lot about a lot of different things, and all of that was
  grounded in aesthetic/qualitative engagement with art, literature, philosophy,
  and the like, so his judgments are not <i>naive</i>, but they <i>are</i> still judgments that
  others might disagree with.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, why did I want to spend a whole post just on "morphology"? Well, it's a
  helpful way of looking at things that has largely fallen out of favor in
  scientific circles, and with so many fields striving to be as "scientific" as
  they can, even those that morphology comes more naturally to have emphasized it
  less. Here's one classic example: from Aristotle onward, it's been a standard
  part of the study of politics to look at the structure of a government or a
  piece thereof - monarchy, oligarchy, or democracy. The United States
  Constitution was built on such morphological grounds - make the Executive branch
  like a monarchy, the Legislative like a democracy, and the Judicial like an
  oligarchy. If you held yourself to only looking at the behavior of specific
  politicians, you'd miss some important things about how the US government works.
  A less orthodox example is for creativity - for example, I took a look at one
  take on what defines Cyberpunk structurally and then applied those
  characteristics in a novel way to my D&amp;D setting, Fellhold.
  </p>

  <p>
  Obviously, history is another field where a morphological approach can be
  helpful, and we'll see more implications of this as we talk through more of
  Spengler's points.

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-April-23
  </p>

  <p>
  Lately, I've been giving some thought to a thread that seems to run through
  three of the best-known tales about Woden. The three tales I have in mind are
  when Woden gives up his eye for a drink of Meomer's (Mimir's) Well, when he
  hangs himself upon the World Tree to find the Runes, and when he brings back the
  Mead of Poetry to Esegeard (Asgard). These tales will already be well known to
  anyone familiar with Germanish lore, most of all those folks who call upon
  Woden. I was looking back over them as I started work on a new <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#lord_of_fallhalls_prayer">Lord of
  Fallhall's prayer</a>. As I read back through them and thought about how I might
  build them into my new prayer, I found a thread of liknesses between these
  tales, but what grabbed me even more was that there was one spot where the
  thread was <i>not</i> clear, but instead murky. So, after bethinking (meditating) on
  this murky bit, I'm writing this post to try to work out what's going on there.
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, first off, let's do a quick run through of what happens in these tales.
  The most straightforward one, and the one that sets the stage for the thread I'm
  drawing between them, is Woden giving his eye for a drink from the Well of
  Memory. It is told in <i>Voluspa</i> 28 and in <i>Gylfaggining</i> 14. To gain a drink from
  this Well, which brings great Wisdom, Woden gives one of his eyes to its keeper,
  Meomer. While there are some other takes, such as that by putting his eye in the
  Well, Woden has ongoing insight into the memories of all beings in all the
  worlds, and thus ever-deepening wisdom, this tale is most often seen as Woden
  paying a very high price for a drink of great worth linked with the wisdom that
  is Woden's key attribute.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, we have Woden giving himself to himself as a sacrifice upon the World Tree
  in order to win the Runes, as told in <i>Havamal</i> 138-141. He hangs (likely
  literally hanged, as this was the most often found kind of sacrifice to Woden -
  hanging), wounded by a spear, for nine nights upon the World Tree. He looks
  "down" and comes back "up" with the Runes. So, once again, we have Woden paying
  a high price for something of great worth linked with wisdom, but here the Runes
  rather than a drink. What's interesting, though, is that the <i>root</i> of the World
  Tree is called out by name here, and we know that at least one of the roots goes
  to Wyrd's Well. We also know that the Wyrds are the ones who carved the Runes
  into the tree in the first place, and the Runes are deeply linked with the Wyrds
  and their Well. So I do not think it is crazy to consider that at least one part
  of winning the Runes was a drink from the Well of Wyrd.
  </p>

  <p>
  By now, you can likely see where I'm going with this, most of all since the last
  of these three tales is so <i>very</i> clearly about getting a drink of great worth
  linked with wisdom. I'll tell this tale in bit more depth, in part since we <i>have</i>
  more depth, but also since it might help with working out the murky bit we're
  closing in on. The Mead of Poetry has a somewhat winding backstory, which is
  given most thoroughly in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> 1 and is referenced in <i>Havamal</i> 104-110.
  When the Ese (Aesir) and Wen (Vanir) came together in frith (peace) after their
  war, they all spat into a vat (maybe after chewing some berries, more in a tick)
  and from the spit shaped a man called Kvasir. There is some thinking that the
  roots of the word Kvasir are linked with a kind of berry that was used to make a
  ritual heady drink in elder times. At any rate, Kvasir is the wisest of all
  men/Gods, and he wanders the world helping folks out and answering whatever they
  ask. A couple of dwarves, though, by the names of Fjalar ("Hider" or "Deceiver"
  most likely, but meaning is unsettled) and Galar ("Screamer") kill Kvasir and
  brew his blood into mead (the tellings we have don't say why). This is the Mead
  of Poetry, and drinking it brings great wisdom. These dwarves aren't through
  killing folks yet, though, and they also kill the ettin ("giant") Gilling ("The
  Noisy One", or again, "The Screamer") by taking him out rowing in a boat and
  sinking it, letting him drown, and then his mourning wife by dropping a
  millstone on her. Nasty bit of work, these two. Well, Gilling's son Suttung
  ("Heavy With Drink," but here again, meaning unsettled) does what is looked for
  from kinsfolk in those days and comes to get some kind of wergeld from the
  dwarves. He puts them on a rock that floods at the high tide and told them to
  give him the Mead of Poetry if they want to get off before they drown, and so he
  gets it. Suttung then takes the mead in three holders, <i>Son</i> (either
  "Reconcilliation" or "Blood," both of which seem linked with what happened to
  Kvasir), <i>Bodhn</i> ("Vessel"), and <i>Odhroerir</i> ("The One That Stimulates to Ecstasy",
  likely first the name of the Mead of Poetry itself, but Snorri interpreted a bit
  of <i>Havamal</i> as meaning it was the cauldron that held it), and puts it under the
  mountain <i>Hnitbjorg</i> ("Colliding Rocks") warded by his daughter, Gunnlodh
  ("Invitation to Battle").
  </p>

  <p>
  All that backstory before Woden even comes into the tale! Woden sets out to get
  the Mead, and along the way, he comes upon nine thralls (slaves) mowing grass
  for hay with scythes. He pulls out a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#what_to_make_of_whetstones_in_germanish_tales">whetstone</a> and sharpens all of their
  scythes. They give the newly sharpened tools a try and are very happy with how
  much better they work, so they all want to buy it, each putting forth what
  outlay he thinks will get him the stone. Woden, though, instead throws the stone
  up into the air, and the thralls clumsily get after it, and in the ruckus slit
  each other's throats. Woden goes on his way and finds their owner, who "just so
  happens" to be Suttung's brother Baugi ("Ring Shaped"). Baugi is grousing about
  losing all his thralls and wondering how he's going to get all the work on his
  holding done. Woden says he'll do the work of nine men all summer long, if Baugi
  can get him a drink of the Mead of Poetry. Baugi tells him that his brother
  Suttung keeps it all to himself, and so he doesn't know if he'll be able to get
  a drink for Woden, but he'll at least try. So, Woden spends the summer doing the
  work of nine thralls, and sure enough, gets it all done, so Baugi takes him to
  see Suttung. Surprising no one, Suttung tells them "hell no" when they ask for a
  taste of the mead. Thanks to the work Woden did, though, he gets Baugi to help
  him get into the mountain to get at the mead. Baugi pulls out the drill Rati
  ("Drill," cleverly enough) and begins drilling into the mountain. He stops and
  says the hole is good to go, but Woden blows into it and sees that the dust and
  rock chips fly back out toward him, which shows that the hole doesn't go all the
  way through, so he tells Baugi to keep going. Again, Baugi says it's good, this
  time the dust flies through, so Woden turns into a snake to go through the hole,
  and for some reason, Baugi tries to stab him with the drill, but he dodges and
  gets through the hole and into the mountain.
  </p>

  <p>
  Once inside, Woden turns back into a man and finds Suttung's daughter Gunnlodh
  guarding the Mead. To give him a drink, she asks him to spend three nights with
  her, and he agrees. After the three nights, she seats him on a golden stool and
  offers him each of the three holders of the Mead. Woden, though, takes huge
  drinks and drains all three in one sip each. He then flees the mountain, holding
  the Mead inside himself, and turns into an eagle to fly back to Esegeard.
  Suttung also turns into an eagle and gives chase. Woden gets back to Esegeard
  and spits out the Mead into waiting holders, and so now the Ese have the Mead of
  Poetry. Snorri tells us that Woden made it just in time, but not what Suttung
  did after (was he killed like Thjazi chasing after Idun? Did he fly away in
  shame?). He <i>does</i> tell us that it was such a close call that Woden pissed out
  some of the Mead, and this is where <i>bad</i> poetry comes from.
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, so why have I gone into so much depth with this tale, after dealing
  with the others so shortly? Well, first off, we <i>have</i> a longer telling of this
  tale than the others. Through some putting together of having poems to hand we
  no longer have, known kennings, and his own creativity, Snorri spun this one in
  far more depth than the others. Anyhow, I've given all this so thoroughly since
  I do not know what might be weighty and what not, with the business at hand.
  What is that business? Well, I have the inkling that this tale follows the same
  framework as the other two, but maybe less markedly. There is not at first blush
  a <i>Well</i>, and it is not altogether clear what <i>price</i> Woden paid, but we again deal
  with Woden going on a quest to get a drink linked with Wisdom that becomes one
  of his hallmarks. For the link, I'm indebted to Maria Kvilhaug in her <i>Maiden
  with the Mead</i> and <i>Yggdrasil's Seed</i>. She shows many of the parallels between the
  many tales of a Male Seeker going through hardships to reach a Maiden, who gives
  Him a drink of Mead which gives some wonderful quality. Well, there's not a
  clear maiden in the tale of Meomer's Well, not a clear drink in the winning of
  the Runes, and not a clear Well in the winning of the Mead of Poetry, but there
  are some hinting links.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, I think it is the "drink" that is likely the common bond between these
  tales. This one is fairly readily dealt with: as I said above, the Runes are
  <i>very</i> closely linked with the Well of Wyrd, maybe <i>the</i> foremost of "cosmological
  wellsprings of drink" in Germanish lore. As such, the thought that at least one
  bit of how Woden won the Runes was to drink from this Well is not so
  far-fetched. So that gets us a "drink" in all three tales. Next, we have the
  lack of a Maiden at the Well of Memory. This one is a bit trickier. Gunnlodh is
  very prominently shown in the tale of the Mead of Poetry, Wyrd (Old Norse <i>Urdhr</i>)
  is the eldest of the Three Wyrds (Wyrd, Werdhende, and Sculd), and so is implied
  in the Winning of the Runes, if we accept the link to the Well of Wyrd, but what
  of Meomer's Well? I don't have a straightforward answer here. Meomer is (maybe)
  an ettin, is (maybe) Woden's maternal uncle, and is (definitely) an initiatory
  figure. In many of these "Maiden with the Mead" tales, the Maiden has a male
  warder figure. The best I can do is that Meomer's Well has the warder, but not
  the Maiden, at least as told to us. That leaves us with the Well. This might be
  even more of a stretch than the bit about the Maiden, but bear with me. One of
  the things that struck me about the first two tales is that they have two of the
  three Wells given as watering the three roots of the World Tree. Meomer's Well
  and Wyrd's Well are both straightforward enough, but where is <i>Hvergelmir</i>? Well,
  Kvilhaug puts forward that these Mead-giving Maidens are often in the
  Underworld, and may or may not be figures of Death themselves. Hvergelmir is in
  the Underworld. One of the Maidens linked with this mythic complex in
  complicated ways is Idun, and one of her kennings is "The Keeper of the Sun of
  Hvergelmir." I'm not arguing anything as simple as "Gunnlodh is Idun," but I do
  think there's enough thematic overlap to make this case: Gunnlodh lives under a
  mountain and plays a role similar to other "Underworld Maidens," making it not
  crazy that she is a death/Underworld figure. If so, a link with the Well of the
  Underworld (Hvergelmir) would not be crazy.
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, so, however flimsily, we now have a link between drinks from the three
  Wells that feed the World Tree that Woden took. At two of them, he paid a clear
  price (his eye and his life), but at the third, the price is not as clear. Is it
  the three nights with Gunnlodh? Given that she isn't said to be ugly or
  terrible, and none of the latter day drawings of her felt that she should be
  either, this doesn't seem like much of a "cost." One thought is that the <i>Havamal</i>
  telling might hint that Woden <i>married</i> Gunnlodh and then skipped out on her once
  he got the Mead as a dowry. If this reading is right, then might the cost be
  giving up his word/good name/wedded life with Gunnlodh? Maybe the cost is the
  summer Woden spent working for Baugi. If so, was the price paid the work itself,
  or the giving up of status in allowing himself to be a thrall? Does the
  whetstone have anything to do with it? How about Kvasir's backstory? And what of
  all this drilling and double crossing stuff?
  </p>

  <p>
  Right now, I'm leaning toward some combination of lowering Himself to thralldom
  and actually doing the work of nine men as the initiatory "price" paid by Woden
  for the Mead of Poetry, but I haven't wholly settled on that. I have the
  niggling feeling that I'm missing something in the symbolism of the tale. If you
  have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

  <title>What to Make of Whetstones in Germanish Tales?</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-April-17
  </p>

  <p>
  So, I was reading thinking about the three wells from which the roots of
  Yggdrasil, the World Tree, draw their sustenance, as one does. It struck me that
  Woden paid a high price and gained something from at least two of the three,
  giving up his eye for a drink from Meomer's Well and giving up his life to wrest
  the Runes from Wyrd's Well, but what, then, of Hvergelmir? I wondered if maybe
  Woden's <i>other</i> famous drink, the Mead of Poetry, might somehow be linked here.
  Sure enough, poking around Maria Kvilhaug's <a href="https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/23958/18497.pdf">Maiden and the Mead</a> and <a href="https://the3littlesisters.com/catalog_explorer/the-seed-of-yggradsill/">The
  Seed of Yggdrasil</a>, she proposes just such a link. Now, that led me to wonder
  "what did he pay for that drink?" The ready answer is the three nights he spent
  with Gunnlodh, but that hardly seems to go in the same category as
  self-mutilation and sacrifice. Wondering this led me to look again at the rest
  of the myth, as told in <i>Skaldskaparmal</i> in the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, and it once again
  struck me that there's a bunch of little details that seem. . . odd. One of
  which is a scene featuring a whetstone, which reminded me that there's another
  myth prominently featuring a whetstone (Thor's duel with the giant Hrungnir),
  which led me to ask myself, Jerry Seinfeld style, "what's the deal with
  whetstones?"
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org7c01a85"></a>Odin's One Weird Trick to Get a Summer Job<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7c01a85">
  <p>
  First off, the bit of the tale that got me started down this road: on his way to
  get some of the mead, Odin meets nine thralls mowing grass with scythes. (Aside:
  I'm switching to all Norse names for telling the tale, since that's the version
  we have. Maybe sometime I'll get into how I treat Old Norse vs Old English vs
  modern Englished names of the Gods). Odin pulls out a whetstone and offers to
  sharpen up their scythes. They agree, and once he does, they do a few test
  swings and are thrilled - the scythes work <i>way</i> better now. All nine of them want
  to buy the whetstone, each putting forth what he's willing to pay. Instead of
  taking any of these deals, Woden throws the whetstone up in the air, and in
  their clumsy haste to snatch it up, they all kill each other with their newly
  razor-sharp scythes. As "luck" would have it, these nine thralls belonged to the
  brother of the giant who has the mead, and Odin offers to do the work of nine
  men over the summer if Baugi can get him a taste of that mead. Baugi says
  "sorry, man, my brother has it and he won't even share it with me, but I'll see
  if I can get him to let you have some."
  </p>

  </li>

  <li><a id="orgc653c49"></a>Stephen Mitchell to the Rescue - Whetstones Stand for Authority<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc653c49">
  <p>
  So, what the heck is going on here besides a weird fairy-tale kind of excuse for
  Odin to get an "in" with sons of Gilling? I've long wondered this, but never
  strongly enough to run it down, until now. I took a look at a bunch of my
  <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#list_of_books_on_germanish_belief_with_thoughts">books</a>, and found some intriguing hints, but nothing really satisfying. Then
  through a shot-in-the-dark web search ("whetstones in Norse myth"), I found "The
  Whetstone as Symbol of Authority in Old English and Old Norse" by Stephen A.
  Mitchell, which pretty much answered the very thing I was asking myself.
  Mitchell argues that whetstones were a symbol for kingly might across Germanish
  lands and for a very long time, drawing on archaeological, linguistic, and
  written evidence. He believes this claim for a few linked reasons: 1. widespread
  metaphorical linkage between "sharpness" and wits, 2. kings were often symbolic,
  or even literal, "weapon givers", 3. whetstones were used by smiths, who were
  magic and holy, and 4. there's seems to be a Proto-Indo-European link between
  some kind of "stone" and the sky/it's chief God.
  </p>

  <p>
  First, all of the Germanish tongues use words for sharp/sharpen/hone to mean
  both that someone is clever or witful, but also as verbs meaning to "egg on" or
  "incite" (the "egg" there, by the way, is a borrowing from Old Norse from a word
  that means <i>to sharpen</i>, but the English phrase comes straight from Old Norse
  usage). You can see how these would be key king skills, and sure enough, in the
  sagas, we see Kings who are good at their job doing these very things, and kings
  who are bad at their job either not doing them, or doing them poorly. King
  Canute's worthless older brother was called "Harald Hein," <i>Hein</i> being a cognate
  for "hone," in the same way that he might have been called "tiny" if he was very
  fat. So, we know that the way folks talked and thought in lands where Germanish
  tongues were spoken saw "sharpness" and "sharpening" as things that go with
  kingship.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, among such warlike folk, Kings often put swords in their followers hands,
  whether literally ("here's a sword - go kill that guy") or symbolically ("and
  where did the wealth to get such fine gear come from? Oh, that's right, the rich
  farmland I gave you"). Since swords were so closely linked with kings, anything
  to do with swords would likely be fair game for becoming a symbol of kingship.
  And whetstones did just that! In the well-known Sutton Hoo burial, they found a
  scepter with a piece of whetstone as the ball on the top of it (likely linked
  side thought: the scepter itself comes from hammers/clubs wielded by kings,
  which are themselves linked with the blunt weapon of the fighter of the Gods -
  Thor's Hammer, Hercules's club, and so forth). Besides the two myths I brought
  up, there are also two sagas where a whetstone stands for kingly might/right. In
  the Mead story, it might mean something that Odin uses a symbol of kingship to
  take out some thralls, but I haven't worked out wholly what that might be yet.
  </p>

  <p>
  Third, and now we're getting more mythological, from a very early time, smiths
  were seen as having awesome and uncanny powers, very likely with religious
  overtones. The whetstone is one of the tools of the metalworking trade, and so
  it likely took on some of this religious awe and mystery. Also, whetstones often
  throw off sparks, which look rather like lightning - bright, fast-moving light
  from nowhere that can start a fire. That might help to explain why Hrungnir
  brings a whetstone to a magic weapon fight. This link with the holy would likely
  strengthen the associations we talked about above, even if in later times it was
  not part of day-to-day life to see smiths as magic and/or holy, symbols can
  linger on for a very long time after the association that led to it being a
  symbol is forgotten - like scepters as signs of kingly might/right and the clubs
  they were based on.
  </p>

  <p>
  Lastly, Mitchell points out the comparative evidence from far-flung
  Indo-European tongues that some words for "stone" and "sky" have the same root.
  There are also some mythological parallels. What's striking about the four
  Germanish tales we have about whetstones, though, is that <i>three</i> of them show the
  stone somehow moving through the air - Odin throwing it up high, Hrungnir
  throwing his at Thor, and in <i>Gautrek's Saga</i>, the king throws a whetstone at his
  hawk to get it back to work. So, if we buy that the sparks from whetstones were
  linked with lightning and that the "stone" linked etymologically with "sky"
  could be a whetstone, then these stories of hurled whetstones likely come from a
  story about some kind of holy whetstone moving through the air (clouds? the sun?
  I dunno).

  <p>
  I haven't had time to really let this sink in yet - for one thing, I want to
  bethink (meditate) at least a few times on all of these tales, what they share,
  how they are unalike, and so forth. I still haven't worked out what the link is
  to Odin's payment for the mead, but I did <i>at last</i> unknot something that had been
  bugging me for years, so I call that a win.

  <li><a id="org48433ec"></a>Lead-In: What is Narcissism?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org48433ec">
  <p>
  (The post's name is a joke, by the way. Lest I die of maximum irony, I don't
  plan on talking about myself much here.)
  </p>

  <p>
  For the past few weeks, I spent most of my spare time going through the archives
  of <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/archives.html">The Last Psychiatrist</a>, a "post-rationalist" blog written by, you guessed it,
  a psychiatrist. It's wide-ranging, covering everything from in-depth breakdowns
  of studies on psychiatric medication to write ups of pop culture. One thread,
  though, became maybe his main theme, and it pulled me in and wouldn't let go:
  Narcissism. The likeness he paints of this way of seeing the world and how rife
  it is in today's America seemed worryingly spot-on. Ready to become deeply
  worried about yourself, your friends and family, and your culture? Then climb
  aboard.
  </p>

  <p>
  First off, let's lay out what he means by "narcissism," as what he's talking
  about is neither what most folks mean when they say the word, nor what the DSM
  calls "Narcissistic Personality Disorder." For The Last Psychiatrist (hereafter
  "TLP"), narcissism does <i>not</i> mean "grandiosity" or "having a wildly overblown
  opinion of yourself." Instead, it means having an identity that you have
  more-or-less made up, rather than one that has grown out of what you <i>do</i>, and
  guarding that identity keenly. Folks who do this lean toward seeing themselves
  as the main character in their own story and anyone else as only backup
  characters. So far, so irksome, but so what? Well, when a narcissist's identity
  is threatened, the wonted answer is <i>rage</i> - anger wildly out of keeping with what
  set it off. When we're lucky, this is only a laughable shouting fit.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we're not, narcissists kill their whole family and then themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you'd like to get TLP's take in a (fairly) short shape, I'd steer you to <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2006/12/if_this_is_one_of_the_sexiest.html">this
  post</a> as the clearest "summary" (it's still pretty long). If you <i>truly</i> want to
  get his full take, with lots of examples of what he means, check out every post
  under "<a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/">Narcissism</a>". Even there, many of his other posts not under that header
  still touch on it. If you're willing to settle for my take, read on for a
  (fairly) short rundown.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgdcd48c1"></a>Identity<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdcd48c1">
  <p>
  So, the root of narcissism seems to be a "constructed" identity. "I am a rebel"
  or "I am a sensitive artist" or "I am a no-nonsense businessman" or whatever.
  These tend to be at least somewhat conscious - it's how you think of yourself,
  whether or not you explicitly put a label on it (but you likely do). What's so
  bad about that, though? Well, the problem is what's behind these self-assigned
  identities: vast, yawning insecurity. You desperately <i>tell yourself</i> "I'm a
  sensitive artist" because deep down, you are worried that you are <i>nothing</i>. You
  feel adrift and meaningless, and you hope that if you convince everyone (but
  most of all yourself) that you <i>really are</i> a sensitive artist, that insecurity
  will go away. There's a catch 22 in all this, though: you know you're faking it.
  So, if other people <i>really do</i> start treating you like a sensitive artist: you
  get gallery showings, you're written up in snooty magazines, models and rich
  folks want to be seen hanging out with you, and so forth, you end up subject to
  Groucho Marx's famous quip: "I don’t want to belong to any club that would
  accept me as one of its members."
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's take a far more common example. You have a young man who wants to be the
  kind of guy that women like. After first longing for girls that he's afraid to
  talk to, he eventually works up the nerve to ask a few out, and he gets
  rejected. Rather than turning bitter and assuming it's them that don't see his
  greatness (another unfortunately common narcissistic type), he decides he'll
  work out what he's doing wrong. So he works out, starts dressing nicer, learns
  how to look and act confident, and then he asks out a beautiful girl, she says
  yes, it goes well, and they start dating. You might think he'd be like "hooray,
  I have successfully become the kind of man that women want! My identity is
  secure!" but you would very likely be wrong. Instead, for as long as things go
  well, part of him is thinking "did I just fool her into liking me?" and if the
  answer is "yes", then she's not a good source of validation, because she's too
  easily tricked. If the answer is "no", then she's not a good source of
  validation, because she's a bad judge of character - she likes this person that
  is so unlikable? What's wrong with her? It gets worse, though - even if all of
  that remains in the background or shut down, if/when things go badly and they
  break up, well, now he has "proof" that women don't really like him at all, or
  that all his work phony, or what have you.
  </p>

  <p>
  This will all likely either sound completely nuts or horrifyingly familiar. The
  problem was that our hypothetical dude was too focused on his "felt sense of
  identity" and not enough on "what are the things I've done and how do they
  compare to an external set of standards that I have internalized as truly
  important." Instead of asking "am I a guy girls want to be with?" it would have
  been better if he had learned to value <i>for itself</i>, being fit, being comfortable
  taking calculated risks, showing respect to himself and those around him by
  dressing well, treating romantic partners with love and respect, and so forth.
  That way, his sense of "who am I?" is not based on a <i>label</i> and is not based on
  "what does she think of me," but is instead based in "well, it's important to me
  to do certain things. Did I do them? Well, at least kinda, the best I could.
  Yeah, I fell down here and here, but I did a pretty good job there."
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgd1ec091"></a>Main Character<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd1ec091">
  <p>
  One way that this guarding of identity shows up is that the narcissist sees
  himself as the lead character in his own movie or book, everyone else is only a
  background character. Of course, this is somewhat metaphorical, a way to talk
  about how a narcissist can't put himself in someone else's shoes. But <i>also,</i>
  thanks to the pop culture that raised us all, a lot of times this is very nearly
  literally true: a narcissist sees his life as a story, that it "must" have some
  deeper meaning right around the corner, and one day he'll be seen as the special
  hero he badly wants to be.
  </p>

  <p>
  This shows up as everything getting linked back to the narcissist. It's not
  about doing what's good for the children, it's about <i>am I be a good father</i>? It's
  not about acknowledging the grief of someone at the funeral, it's about <i>am I a
  supportive friend</i>? It's not about working with someone worthy that you love to
  build a life together, it's <i>am I the kind of man who would have a wife like
  this</i>?
  </p>

  <p>
  The more narcissistic someone is, the less it even crosses his mind to think of
  things any other way - what other ways of thinking even are there? Different
  ways of looking at me?
  </p>

  <p>
  If you want to spot a narcissist in the wild, one good rule of thumb is to look
  for how many times he uses "I, me, my, mine." If you ask him about someone else,
  mark how quickly it gets linked back to what he knows or has done, or if you get
  a beat with puzzlement as he wraps his brain around this weird way of thinking -
  <i>other people's perspectives? Who knew</i>?
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org3cb353c"></a>Narcissistic Injury<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3cb353c">
  <p>
  The worst thing that can happen to a narcissist is to be confronted with a
  threat to his identity. The "successful businessman" that is about to be exposed
  as faking it through massive debt. The "family values" politician about to be
  found out for having gay sex in airport bathrooms. The "promising young man"
  confronted with the fact that he is no longer young and he has squandered
  whatever promise he once had. The very worst threat to a narcissist's identity,
  though, is "who are you, again?" Things may be going <i>terribly</i> for a narcissist,
  but as long as he can tell himself the suffering is <i>about him</i>, then he's still
  the main character, his identity is intact as "persecuted hero" or
  "long-suffering stoic" or whatever. Telling your narcissistic husband than
  you're leaving him, getting into a screaming match about it, dragging it out
  through awful family court drama - all of that is, at least, still somewhat
  about him. If you just leave in the night and never speak to him again, just
  send the paperwork to be signed, no emotion, no reaction - <i>that</i> is a
  narcissistic injury.
  </p>

  <p>
  The frightening thing about narcissistic injury is, as I mentioned in the
  lead-in, it leads to <i>rage</i>. The unbearable tension between "who I <i>need</i> to think
  of myself as" with "here's evidence you're definitely not that guy" is resolved
  by lashing out at whomever is felt to most strongly be causing this tension. If
  a man thinks he's a good husband, but his wife points out to him he's never
  around, he doesn't help with the chores or the kids, and he doesn't even have a
  good job as an excuse for any of that, he's going to be <i>pissed</i> and it's going to
  be <i>at her</i>, because on some level he knows she's right. Again, the vast majority
  of the time, narcissistic injury leads to the equivalent of a temper tantrum -
  screaming, insults, accusations, and so forth. Sometimes, though, it can be much
  worse. If you go and look at what we know about folks who have done mass
  killings or killed their girlfriends/spouses/families (and often themselves
  after), it pretty much always becomes clear that it's about some identity and a
  threat to it. So, if you have someone in your life that this post seems to apply
  to more than you'd like, think very hard and be <i>very careful</i>. Maybe there's a
  gentle way to nudge them toward a less narcissistic outlook, or maybe you need
  to go. Whatever the case, think twice before you threaten them with public
  shame, anything that would make either the folks they care about most, or lots
  of folks (or both), see them as not what they want to think they are.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgd70452b"></a>Help! I Think this Might Be Me<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd70452b">
  <p>
  First off, by this meaning, <i>everybody</i> is at least a little narcissistic, and you
  have to be. Secondly, if you're young (teens or twenties), more of this is
  developmentally normal. So don't give up on yourself yet.
  </p>

  <p>
  That being said, if some of this post left you feeling unsettled (as TLP's posts
  did for me), the way forward is both straightforward and very hard. As much as
  you can, you need to think of other folks as their own beings, with their own
  will, <i>not</i> as what they are to you, and you need to take more heed of what you <i>do</i>
  than "who I am". So, don't ask yourself "how can I be a better father?", instead
  ask "what can I do to help my daughters?" Don't say "I want to be more secure in
  myself", instead say "here's how my deeds stack up to an outside, measurable
  standard." As I said, straightforward, but hard.
  </p>

  <p>
  Journaling, therapy, meditation, and other ways of finding insights about
  yourself can help you come to know that this is something you might need need to
  work on, but it seems they don't do much to help you change since the <i>point</i> of
  narcissism is to ward off change. What's the way around this? Use your
  narcissistic leanings on behalf of something better and "fake it till you make
  it."
  </p>

  <p>
  Worried you have trouble seeing your kin as anything other than outgrowths of
  yourself? Then make the identity that you work so hard to guard that of
  "steadfast husband and father." Maybe it doesn't "feel true," you know you're
  faking it? So what? It's not for you! It's for them. If you want to be "a
  writer", well, start cranking words out, <i>most of all if it feels fake</i>. Just keep
  going. One day, you'll have a body of work, and instead of saying "I'm a
  writer", you can say "I wrote that." Lastly, adopting a more-or-less explicit
  code of ethics/behavior that is grounded in what you <i>do</i> rather than "who you
  are" seems like it ought to help - religion or other spiritual practice is
  likely helpful here, as long as it pushes you. If you find yourself using your
  religion to give yourself a pass - "I know I spent a week and thousands of
  dollars on hookers and blow, but Jesus still loves me, so my wife will too" -
  then you have yoked it to the narcissism.
  </p>

  <p>
  All of this is hard work, not least because our whole pop culture and the way we
  were raised pushes us toward narcissism, and if you're an adult, you've likely
  settled into it somewhat.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, if you want to do better, you have to ask: "who might I be hurting, and what
  can I do to stop?"

  <title>Last(?) "Hail Idun"</title>

  </p>

  <p>
  Whew, I think I have <i>at last</i> gotten to the shape of the "Hail Idun" that I want to use for my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>. Those of you that have been following along have seen that it's taken rather a lot of tinkering to get here (and I didn't show all my work!), but I'm pretty happy with what I've gotten to, and my Rune casting says this ought to go well.
  </p>

  <p>
  A very big thanks to everyone who has shared feedback on my earlier tries at getting this right - all of your thoughts were very welcome, even if I didn't end up going with the words or thoughts you put forward, you still helped steer me toward what we have here. Of course, if you don't like it, that's all on me!
  </p>

  <p>
  As I believe I've said before, this prayer is rather idiosyncratic and builds on what has come out of my bethinking (meditation), divination, and worship. What might strike you as odd, though, is that I didn't put in anything about apples and did put in "ale." Mostly this comes from some of the kennings for Idun given by Snorri, such as "ale giver" and "drink willow." I've come to think (shaped somewhat by Maria Kvilhaug's thinking) that Idun is linked with the myths of Goddesses/Giantesses that ward/give drinks with magical/religious weight. The lack of apples is only since I wanted to keep in a link to Yggdrasil and to the "drink," and I ran out of room!
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Hail Idun,<br>
  Yggdrasil's Seed,<br>
  well-spoken wife of wordcraft,<br>
  wreathed in blessed blossoms.<br>
  <br>
  Holy Idun,<br>
  open our hearts<br>
  with ale's dearest drink<br>
  to awakening of everlasting life.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  I hope that you find this prayer helpful, whether to use as-is, or as a spur to coming up with your own. Either way, I'd love to hear how it goes.

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-March-26
  </p>

  <p>
  Back when I was about to get out of the Army, for a while I thought I was going to become a farmer. One of my good buddies turned me on to Joel Salatin, the founder of <a href="https://polyfacefarms.com/">Polyface Farm</a>, who has worked out a way to raise animals ethically, in a way that helps the environment, and make good money doing it. I was inspired and bought all his books (at the time). Looking back, there was more than a little wishful thinking involved, of course - I grew up in suburbia and have never raised/cared for animals that weren't pets. I ought to have found a way to "test drive" farming - go volunteer somewhere, keep some backyard chickens, that kind of thing. For better or worse, my wife was not so thrilled with the idea, so I found another way. Salatin's whole approach is pretty cool, but I want to share one piece of it here.
  </p>

  <p>
  Salatin manages to keep more cattle per acre than any of the neighboring farms. There's a few things that let him do this - like a commitment to building soil through composting and using the farm for more than just cattle - he raises sheep and pigs in a way that mimics a natural ecosystem, similar to Takao Furuno's approach described in <i>The Power of Duck</i>. The main way, though, is both counter-intuitive and simple: smaller paddocks. In case agricultural vocabulary is not one of your hobbies, a "paddock" is a fenced-in area for the keeping of livestock. When raising cattle, often folks will not just let them loose on their whole land, but will instead rotate them through a few paddocks. Salatin's paddocks at Polyface Farm are much smaller than those on most ranches. The result? More cows per acre.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sounds bad, right? "Cramming cows into smaller paddocks, forcing them to survive on less land! Open pastures!" That's not actually what's happening here, though. Do you know what cows do when given wide-open pastures? They spread way the hell out. Remember above when I mentioned ecosystems? Well, when you look at ruminants in the wild, what do they do? They huddle together while grazing. Why? Protection from predators. For many reasons, Salatin doesn't fill his farm with wolves, but he <i>does</i> want his cows to huddle together. See, it turns out that when cows spread out, they get very picky - they only eat the <i>tastiest</i> grass, and then they wander over, skip over all the iceberg-equivalent grass and go to the next clump of baby spinach. Cows need variety in their diets, though. If you let them eat anything they want from the full buffet, they skip a lot of what's available. On the other hand, when they're squished together with a bunch of other cows, they eat whatever's in reach before their neighbors can get to it. You've likely already guessed where this is going: smaller paddocks force cows to clump together, which makes them eat more of the available grass, so you get better efficiency while the cows eat just as well (actually better: the variety means more vitamins and the like). Not only do the cows eat more of the grass on the same acreage, you know what grass does over the spring and summer? It <i>grows</i>. Which means that you can rotate back to the same paddock after a few weeks. The smaller paddocks then also mean that you can rotate back sooner, which is even <i>more</i> efficiency. You have more cows, that are better fed, and therefore tastier, on the same amount of land, <b>and</b> the cows are even happier about it, than if you'd let them "roam free(ish)" on the entirety of your land.
  </p>

  <p>
  As an exercise for the reader, I encourage you to think about any other mammals that come to mind who are regularly allowed to spread out nearly as much as they like and do as they damn well please, but maybe were better off when circumstances constrained them to huddling together, finding every bit of value in the immediate space they could.
  </p>

  <p>
  A bit late tonight, as my kids were home for Spring Break and after they got to bed, my wife and I finished watching <i>The Sopranos</i> for the first time (very short thoughts: great show, stupid ending, though not inconsistent thematically). At any rate, I've been meditating on the words for my take on a "Hail Idun" all week, taking into account a lot of thoughts from the <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/223141.html?thread=39594405#cmt39594405">feedback I got</a>. I think I'm getting closer, but I'm still not there, so here's three more takes:

  </p>

  <p>
  The first thing I have to say is that I'm not wholly happy with my thoughts below. I've read the book and I'm thinking about it, but I might need to do more to truly soak it in. I started writing this post to get those thoughts in order, and now that I've done so, some of it has come together, but other bits have stayed murky. That's all to say, I may come back to this book, and I don't know how long I'll stand behind what I have to say below - we'll see how things go!
  </p>

  <p>
  This book comes highly recommended in several "How to Heathen" books, like Galina Krasskova's <i>Modern Guide to Heathenry</i>. Written in 1982 by Paul C. Bauschatz, who seems to have been an English professor at the University of Maine and published by the University of Massachusetts press, it's <i>very</i> hard to find a copy to buy these days, but seems to be pretty readily available in large libraries (I checked out a copy from the university where I work). My guess is that it didn't get that big a print run, since it's a fairly niche topic, but then Heathens took to it and bought up all the copies and there's never been a reprint. I'm thinking about writing to the publisher to ask them to consider a reprint, given that if you can find a copy at all (checks <a href="https://www.alibris.com">alibris.com</a> - nope), it goes for (checks Amazon) at least $980. Seems like a market opportunity to me.
  </p>

  <li><a id="orgf4698fd"></a>The Main Idea - Pre-Christian Germanish Folk Saw Time Very Unlike Us<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf4698fd">
  <p>
  At any rate, why is this book so sought after by today's heathens? It sets out to explore the pre-Christian Germanish worldview, to try to understand what it was like "from the inside." Specifically, Bauschatz argues that the pre-Christian Germans had a <i>very</i> different conception of how time worked and that this is reflected in their myth, cultural practices and artifacts, and language. Since it turns out you can't really talk about fundamental conceptions of time without getting into cosmology, causality, and other pretty big topics, this turns out to have a lot of interesting things to say for folks interested in understanding Germanish beliefs and lore.
  </p>

  <p>
  So what is this very different way of thinking of time? In short, the Western Christian/post-Christian view of time is the familiar linear "past, present, future," and from a theological perspective, that line exists within an enclosing timeless eternity. Bauschatz didn't make this comparison, but I can't help but see the enclosing timelessness as Magian and the linear perception of time nested within it as Faustian, and the attempt to wed them together the outcome of the pseudomorphosis that produced European Christianity. The elder Germans, though, seem to have seen time as being made of "past and not-past," and of these, the past had far more weight. I'm still working my way through all of this, which is part of why I'm writing these thoughts down, but if I understand right, the main idea is that the importance of things can only be seen in hindsight. A lot of stuff happens, but most of it ends up being trivial - nothing that matters comes of it. Some things, though, become the causes for the events that matter.

  <li><a id="org918c25a"></a>The Well and the Tree - Past Happenings and What Grows from Them<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org918c25a">
  <p>
  So, what are the "Well" and the "Tree" in the name of the book? To my readers who know their way around Germanish Lore, this will be clear enough - the Well of Wyrd and the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. In the lore, the Yggdrasil is said to hold all of the world, and to have its roots in one or more wells, but the best known is the Well of Wyrd, or if you would rather have the Old Norse, <i>Urdhrbrunnr</i>. Now, that word <i>brunnr</i> doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean a "well" in the sense of a shaft dug deep into the ground, lined with stone, and with a bucket to draw water from it, as you likely think of when you hear "well." It seems to have been used to mean all of: wells, springs, streams, and catch basins. The heart of the meaning seems to have been "something from which drinking water is drawn." In today's Germanish tongues, it has mostly specialized to one of those meanings, and in English has almost wholly vanished, other than in a few steadnames that end in "-burn" or "-bourne." The three Norns who tend this "well" - <i>Urdhr</i>, <i>Verdhandi</i>, and <i>Skuld</i> in Old Norse (which is attested), or <i>Wyrd</i>, <i>Werthende</i>, and <i>Sculd</i> in Old English (which is a modern reconstruction) - may or may not have been a conscious borrowing of the Greek <i>Moirae</i> or "Fates," but the thought that the world is a Tree that grows out of a nourishing water source tended by (a) wise woman/women might be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlcT_iL9-U">very old indeed</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Bauschatz argues that these are mythological representations of the way that the elder Germanish folk thought of the world and time. He pulls together archaeological findings, artwork, story motifs, and the use of language to make his case. He does his best to reconstruct what that sense of world and time might have been like, since it seems like it might have been rather unlike how the folks of today see the world, and even more so unlike how we see time. The heart of what these represent to Bauschatz is the <i>containment</i> of the Well and the <i>branching</i> of the Tree. They are linked by a sense of life and growth. The Tree is kept healthy and growing by the water and mud of the Well, and the doings of the Worlds held in/made up by the Tree "fall down" into the Well and renew it. The "now" is the accumulation/fulfillment of everything that has come before, and so the past is at its "fullest" <i>right now</i>. The idea that things started out perfect and have been getting worse, that the world has been deteriorating in a way that will be washed away/renewed by some future event, seems to be wholly outside of how elder Germanish folks saw things.
  </p>

  <p>
  This leads to a few implications: first, the future is not set, but it's not wholly unguessable either. One way to put it might be that the elder Germanish folk would look at a batter hitting the ball and hear the bat hit the ball and see the form of the batter and think "wow, that might be a home run" rather than focusing on the outfielder running to catch the ball and wondering if he'll be at the right place at the right time. Secondly, learning what happened in the past is of great worth, because it's the best way you have of learning about how cause and effect work. Thirdly, doing great deeds lays the needed groundwork for great things to come - you renew the well and feed the tree when you leave great things behind you. These three things seem like a lot of why this book has so strongly struck today's heathens, and I can see why.

  <li><a id="org152332d"></a>The Linguistic Evidence - What Future Tense?<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org152332d">
  <p>
  Very likely the source of Bauschatz's theory, and I suspect the bit that he was most interested in, is a grammatical observation about the German language family. Namely, grammatically-speaking, <i>no</i> Germanish tongue expresses the future morphologically. In fact, <i>every</i> Germanish tongue only conjugates its verbs into past and non-past. This part gets pretty technical, enough so that even as someone who took linguistics classes in College, majored in Latin and Greek, and has read a lot about the linguistic evidence for the origin and dispersal of Indo-European languages, I found it hard to follow.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's take a quick side trip into linguistic concepts and terminology in case the above paragraph read like gobbledygook to you. What do I mean about expressing grammatical concepts "morphologically"? First off, "morphological" is a fancy word for "in the shape of," and when used in linguistics is used to refer to the sounds made in a word, and is most of all used when the sounds of a word <i>change</i> to reflect some change in meaning. For example, "write" is in the present tense, but when I change the vowel to "o", we get "wrote", which is now in the past tense. That's a morphological change. So is making something plural by putting and "-s" on the end - like "kid" and "kids," or weirder changes like "child" and "children." So far, so good?
  </p>

  <p>
  Most Indo-European languages made/make morphological changes to words to convey what they are doing in a sentence grammatically. If you only speak English, this can be tough to get your head around, because we don't do much of that and instead express grammatical function by putting words next to each other - for example, to show who is writing, we put a pronoun next to the word "I write," "you write," and so forth. To show future tense, we add in "will" - "I will write." There's a variety of historical reasons for this that we can get into another time, but one of the contributing factors is what Bauschatz is getting into here, and we'll talk about that in a second.
  </p>

  <p>
  To make the idea of morphological changes to show grammatical function a little clearer, let's take a look at another language that does more than English - Latin. Here, <i>videbo</i> means "I will see" - the <i>vide-</i> bit is the root, meaning "see" and the <i>-bo</i> bit says "I will." If I wanted to say "I will be seen" (passive voice) or "if [something happened], I would see" (subjunctive), you'd make more changes to the verb (<i>videbor</i> and <i>videam</i> respectively). Morphological changes like this seem to have been a big part of how proto-Indo-European worked, which is why all Indo-European languages today make at least some morphological changes to words to convey grammatical meaning. What those changes were in proto-Indo-European is a matter of some debate, and harder to describe than the examples above, but Bauschatz goes into it in the book.
  </p>

  <p>
  The short version is that it seems like proto-Indo-European was doing <i>something</i> similar to tense with morphological changes, but that the various daughter languages evolved in slightly different ways. The Germanish kindred of tongues seems to have evolved to where you had a morphological past and a morphological "not past." Weird as it is to think about, they didn't seem to feel the need to express that something "will happen" in the future until they started being Christian. Take a closer look at how we put something in the future now: "I <i>will</i> write." We don't think about it much, but that "will" is <i>exactly</i> the same word as the will in "willpower." The sense is "I will it to happen," meaning "it is my intention right now to do that thing in the future." Every Germanish tongue has a similar "workaround" for expressing futurity - we slap some kind of helping verb onto a "not past" form of the main verb, and those helping verbs usually mean something like "have in mind" or "intend" or "am obliged to." Fun fact: "shall" as in "I shall do the thing," is etymologically linked with "should," which is the English cognate to the Norn "Skuld."
  </p>

  <p>
  Anyhow, Bauschatz argues that Germanish tongues lack a morphological "future tense" because the idea that you can talk about things in the future as if they're certain, established, "real," just in a different conceptual "place" was outlandish to the folks who spoke Proto-Germanic. The best they could do was to say "well, this is what I intend to happen" or "given what's happened, the most likely outcome seems to be this." As the speakers of these tongues Christianized, they had to grapple with a worldview that saw the future as a more definite thing, something that held the dearest hope of the new religion.

  <li><a id="org2158580"></a>Some Downsides - Academicese, Lack of Grounding in Ways of Belief<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2158580">
  <p>
  Overall, I rather liked the book and it sparked a lot of thoughts, but it has some downsides. For starters, at times you can tell that this book was written in the 80s by an English professor, because it often (usually?) indulges in post-modern academic jargon when it could just state something plainly. Often enough that it's actually hard to follow at times. I can sympathize that Bauschatz's task is a tough one, trying to understand and describe a different way of understanding time and the world than you and your audience take for granted, but it often feels like he leans too hard into abstract terms and the way of talking about things that his field expected at the time to demonstrate you were a member in good standing. Secondly, Bauschatz is very clearly coming at this stuff from a way of looking at things that takes as given that these stories, these ways of thinking, and so forth are nothing more than stories made up to cope with the world, nor more or less true than anyone else's. When he dives deep, it is into the language used. He doesn't seem to give much weight to the stories as stories, as units of meaning with their own worth. There are pros and cons when a writer is a believer in the field being written about (and when not!), but here, I think Bauschatz's valiant attempts to understand what it was like to see the world as an elder German are undercut by his unwillingness to take seriously "what if some bits of how they saw the world were right? what if those things really are handled by Goddesses?

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67a0c6f">
  <p>
  Overall, I think this book is well worth reading and sheds a lot of light on how time, causality, and "fate" are shown in the Germanish lore. That being said, it doesn't seem to do so in the clearest, most straightforward way it might. There are a lot of times where I found myself going "why don't you just say what you mean?" I had hoped this post might be a start toward re-stating the worthwhile insights in a more straightforward way, but I think there's more work to come on that front.

  <title>Jordan Peterson's Framework for Myth</title>

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-March-02
  </p>

  <p>
  Well, after the comments on my <a href="https://jprussell.dreamwidth.org/2951.html">List of Germanish Books with Thoughts</a> went rather long and ended up taking a lengthy detour into discussing Jordan Peterson's way of understanding myths, as laid out in his book <i>Maps of Meaning</i> and in loads of lectures since, I reckoned it might be helpful to spell out that framework as clearly and straightforwardly as I might, because this is one area where I think Peterson is not at his strongest. So many of his lines of thinking and research are linked in his head and have implications for each other, he often fares far afield in a way that can be hard to follow, especially if you're new to his thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
  That being said, I once told a friend that if you listen to enough of Peterson's lectures, in at least one of them, he will spell out his way of thinking about a key topic from the very most bedrock concepts up to the widest implications, and he'll make every step as firmly supported as he knows how. Unfortunately, in every <i>other</i> lecture, he will just refer back to the higher-level implications and how they relate to the topic at hand. His more recent books <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, and presumably (I've yet to read it) <i>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</i>, do a decent job of laying things out in an order that makes sense and builds on each other, but with a lot less of the depth than <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, which I found a bit disappointing. At any rate, if I might flatter myself a moment, I've long felt like my (rather boring) super power is to be able to listen to questions folks have about a topic and understand what it is they're actually confused by, and therefore what answer would help resolve their confusion. I wouldn't have thought this was much of a super power, but after years being on both sides of a classroom, sitting through corporate meetings, attending military trainings and debriefs, and so forth, I've found that it's <i>really</i> common for folks trying to explain things to get a question, and then answer something way different, often while missing the fairly easy distinction the questioner was actually looking for. And so I set out, modestly, to try to more clearly set out the thinking of someone who has made himself known worldwide and rather wealthy by explaining things.

  <li><a id="org619144a"></a>We're Not Going to Talk About the Biological Grounding<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org619144a">
  <p>
  Okay, so if you dig into <i>Maps of Meaning</i>, a decent chunk of the book will be dedicated to explaining some concepts about neurobiology and animal behavior that Peterson wants to use as the foundation for everything that follows. His goal in laying all of this out is to give as firm a material grounding as he can to all of the symbolic and narrative stuff he talks about later. This section is interesting, impressive, and with what little I know of the field, seems pretty comprehensively argued. That being said, if you are <i>not</i> coming at this from a skeptical standpoint, if you already believe stories and myths include important information about what it means to live and how to do so as well as you might, you can likely skip over this. So that's just what we're going to do here: I'll give the <i>briefest</i> of summaries so that you can decide if you're interested in digging in more, but from this point on, I'll assume that you're okay with the premise "the structures of meaning (symbols, narratives, and so forth) within stories and myths give meaningful insights into how the human mind works and how to live a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#open-minded_materialists_gentle_introduction_to_spirituality">meaningful, worthwhile life.</a>" If you don't agree with that premise, I humbly invite you to read my thoughts on finding meaning in life by following that last link.

  <li><a id="org69a36a1"></a>The Very Short Rundown of the Biological Grounding<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org69a36a1">
  <p>
  At least in vertebrates (and maybe even in invertebrates, hence Peterson's infamous thing with the Lobsters), animals seem to have two groundmost motivational systems: to move toward good things and away from bad things. Moving toward good things produces a bunch of feel-good reward chemicals, like dopamine, and moving away from bad things seems to relieve a bunch of feel-bad chemicals that cause anxiety and stress, like cortisol. This leads to a world full of known good and bad things, to which we more or less know how to react, but then an even wider world of the unknown, which holds vast amounts of both good and bad things. As such, we can react to "the unknown" with either the "moving toward good things" motivational system, or with "moving toward, not away from, bad things" anti-reward system. For beings with things like symbols and narratives (like us), we can somewhat choose how we conceptualize of the known and unknown in order to get more of what we want and less of what we don't - are we being forced out into the darkness full of monsters ready to eat us by harsh necessity? Or are we striding into a realm of possibility, ready to handle any obstacles along the way? The former will produce a lot of anxiety and little sense of reward/meaning, whereas the latter will feel full of reward/meaning with minimal anxiety.
  </p>

  <p>
  Got it? Hooray, we just covered roughly the first 13 chapters out of 68 of <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (~84 pages of 469).

  <li><a id="org77852a1"></a>Peterson's Biggest Influences Here are Jung and Nietzsche<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org77852a1">
  <p>
  The next big thing to get out of the way before we talk about the framework itself is that Peterson is first and foremost a synthesizer. He'll be the first to admit that most of the ideas he shares are outgrowths and remixes of the thinking of folks he admires. He has a <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/">big ol' recommended reading list</a> if you want to delve deeper into where his thinking is coming from.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most important thing to know, though, is that Peterson's method of analyzing myth is about 80-90% Jung, with a good seasoning of Nietszche, and then finished out with his other influences. In other words, I mainly think of "Peterson's" analytical framework for myths as a very helpful introduction/guide to understanding myths from a Jungian standpoint. The framework below relies on Jung's concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">"archetypes"</a>, patterns of behavior, symbolism, and association that appear to be very deeply embedded in human brains and that show up in a variety of forms across many cultures and throughout time. For example, the father in the story of the Prodigal Son, Jupiter of Roman myth, and Mufasa from the Lion King all share characteristics of the "Father" archetype - they act in ways fathers often act, they symbolize things fathers tend to symbolize, and they are associated with things fathers tend to be associated with, and in all three case, those actions, symbols, and associations have a lot in common (controlled/protective aggression, warmth and indulgence to children, enforcer of rules, and so forth). Where I think Peterson is helpful is in giving an underlying conceptual framework for how the different archetypes interact with each other in a more systematic way than Jung was willing or able to do (more on the pros and cons of this in a second).
  </p>

  <p>
  Nietzsche maybe does less to create the shape of the framework or the pieces within it, but his thinking and ethos underlie a lot of the application and interpretation of that framework. You might say that Peterson's whole project here, most of all the bit we skipped over so blithely above, with the biological grounding, is a thoroughly Nietzschean undertaking. Nietzsche rather forcibly pointed out "hey guys, if you don't really believe in God, why are you still doing the stuff he told you to? Maybe we should figure something else out instead." Peterson went "huh, but here we are, more than a century later, still doing that stuff - what's driving that? Even if we don't intellectually believe in God, is there something else going on?" So that's why it's helpful to have Nietzsche in mind, even if most of the book is far more directly influenced by Jung (who was, of course, himself influenced heavily by Nietzsche). To put it briefly, the thesis of the book might be something like "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?"

  <li><a id="org98c6ba6"></a>A Quick Word about Abstraction<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org98c6ba6">
  <p>
  Alright, so here we are for the main event. First, a word about abstraction. This model is an example of an abstraction - you might even argue an abstraction of abstractions. What do I mean by abstraction? Here, at least, I mean a general label you generate to explain what several specific instances have in common. So, you read the Prodigal Son, you hear a few myths about Jupiter, and you watch the Lion King. You notice that the father figures in these stories have some things in common. You also think about all of the actual fathers you have known in your life -  your own, your friends', your own experience with your children, and so forth. You notice that some of the things the story-fathers have in common are also shared, mostly, by these real-life fathers. At this point, you have dozens of specific data points, but if you want, you can take the things that all of them (or at least most of them) have in common and call that the "Father abstraction". No one of these individual fathers will 100% match this abstraction, but all of them will match at least a little, and all of them will match the Father abstraction more closely than, say, the Mother abstraction. So far, so good, right?
  </p>

  <p>
  Well, what if what you're interested in is the difference between widowed fathers, and fathers married to natural mothers, and fathers married to step mothers? Now, the unifying "fatherness" between these three categories is maybe helpful, but much less so, because it hides the very distinction you want to pay attention to. Or, what if you're interested in the story of your own father, the actual, individual human being? All of his nuance and idiosyncracy. Well, now what he has in common with other fathers is almost useless, because you want to know precisely about what is unique to him - even if he still exhibits almost all of the traits of the "Father Abstraction".
  </p>

  <p>
  I bring all this up to make clear something about Peterson's approach. There's a general rule with abstractions - the more widely they can be applied, the less accurately the represent any given instance of the abstraction. Let's think about maps. Imagine you have a military-style grid map that covers an area of roughly 500 square kilometers (10 x 5) with a 10 meter contour interval (there are topographical lines on the map showing changes of elevation of 10 meters). This is a fairly detailed map -  you can successfully use it to find your way through the woods pretty well if the changes in elevation are distinct enough, or with the help of a compass. Now imagine we zoom out to a map that is roughly 5,000 square kilometers and shows changes in elevation at 100 meter intervals. This map covers a wider area, which is certainly useful, but you're going to have a much harder time working out if you're in <i>this</i> tiny draw or <i>that</i> one. The zoomed-out map tells you about more places, but it tells you less about all of those places than a more zoomed-in map would tell you about any one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> tends to work down to some pretty granular "abstractions" - some of the entries may only cover a handful of specific instances, but they analyze what those have in common in a lot of detail. Peterson, on the other hand, zooms way out to try to arrive at the six(ish) archetypes that explain <i>every story ever told</i>. This insight struck me when I was thinking about why I was so irritated by this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve">condescending review of Peterson and specifically Maps of Meaning from Current Affairs</a>. Setting aside the other unfair things this article does, what's relevant to this post is that it makes fun of the diagrams in <i>Maps of Meaning</i> for being so simplistic as to be meaningless. I would argue, instead, they are at the high end of abstraction in order to apply as widely as possible. The good news is that the framework these diagrams represent can be applied to almost any story. The bad news is that without familiarity with a broad set of instances to which that framework applies, it doesn't do much to help you. Imagine that you had never reflected much about the symbolic role of "fathers" in stories or the kinds of roles "fathers" tend to play in real life. Now, imagine someone says to you "okay, so what we're looking at here is clearly an instance of the Father archetype" - if you haven't ever connected the specific instances you've encountered to that abstraction, it's not going to do you much good at all. I think that's part of why <i>Maps of Meaning</i> (and Peterson's lectures) is so sprawling - he sees the abstraction linking many instances, but he realizes that not everyone he's speaking to does, so he's desperately trying to cram a wide survey of specifics into your mind so that the generality abstracted from them will mean something to you.

  <li><a id="orgd1dfe5d"></a>Order, Chaos, and the Mediator<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd1dfe5d">
  <p>
  Based on the biological grounding that we so blithely skipped over above, Peterson argues that our perception of the world, at a very fundamental level, is sorted into stuff that we treat as pretty much settled (Order), stuff that hasn't been explored and could be anything (Chaos), and how we feel about those things, right now, and in general (the Mediator). Order is symbolically masculine (if your hackles are hackling, see the aside below), Chaos is symbolically feminine, and the Mediator is <i>almost</i> neuter, as what's most important about the Mediator is usually being the <i>child</i> of a symbolically masculine and symbolically feminine force. That being said, our history being what it is, most stories have been about dudes, so the Mediator is usually depicted as a guy, with some flavoring of symbolic masculinity. The other important thing to keep in mind is that both Order and Chaos tend to be "static" until the Mediator interacts with them. Even if there's a lot of "change" within Chaos, it's not <i>significant</i> change - it's "sound and fury, signifying nothing". Think of a pot of water boiling - lots of movement, no real change. Until you put the pasta in!

  <li><a id="org7278055"></a>A Quick Aside on Gender<br />
  <div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7278055">
  <p>
  Okay, I know gender is a hot topic these days, so I want to make a few things clear about the very simplified presentation here:
  </p>
  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>The symbolic "masculine" and "feminine" here described are <i>not</i> one-to-one with our biological sex, or even the gender we identify with. Everyone has both masculine and feminine elements within them, and folks like Jung and Peterson argue that to be a fully-developed, healthy person, you need to be comfortable with both, and integrate both wholly into your personality. Whether "masculine" symbolic traits have some fundamental link to male biological sex, and if so, to what degree, is not really important to the functioning of this framework, so if it helps, treat it as wholly arbitrary (see 2 below)</li>
  <li>What characteristics get considered "masculine" or "feminine" in this framework are largely derived from looking at lots and lots of myths and seeing what kind of characters are depicted as male and which as feminine. There are a few challenges here: a. the corpus of myths drawn on is almost entirely from the Mediterranean and Europe, from Ancient Egypt through early modern times, and so the myths of other cultures around the world might consistently assign <i>different</i> traits to masculine or feminine archetypes, b. even within the cultures ancestral to the modern West, what gets considered "masculine" and "feminine" has some variation - for example, the Egyptians had a Father Earth and Mother Sky, and to the Germanic folks, the Sun was a beautiful lady and the Moon a macho man. All of which is to say, we're talking in broad brushstrokes here, but ones that are the most useful for understanding the myths and stories of the Ancient Near East, Mediterranean, and Europe through the Early Modern period.</li>
  </ol>

  <li><a id="orgcee5e3b"></a>The Good Side and the Bad Side of the Three Basic Categories<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcee5e3b">
  <p>
  Each of the three basic categories (Order, Chaos, and Mediator) has a good side and a bad side. These bring us back to our basic motivational systems that we briefly summarized in the Biological Grounding above (you see why he went to the trouble to make sure you believed him on that stuff?) The good side of each symbol represents what about it draws us toward it and rewards us if we do indeed go there - Good Order provides helpful predictability, Good Chaos provides new possibilities, and the Good Mediator allows for these things to be balanced dynamically, adjusted as needed. The bad side, then, reflects what about these categories causes anxiety if you can't get away with it - Bad Order is controlling and stifling, Bad Chaos is wild and unpredictable, the Bad Mediator is too absorbed in him/herself to balance the others and makes things worse. Putting this Good/Bad valence together with the three basic categories gives us six main archetypes, which Peterson argues represent a fairly complete, coherent view of how the world works and how to find meaning within it.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgf3777eb"></a>The Good King and the Tyrant - Order, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf3777eb">
  <p>
  If you've grown up playing D&amp;D like me, and even more so if you've delved into the Poul Anderson and Michael Moorcock fiction that inspired its alignment system, you're likely used to thinking of Order as "basically good". Peterson argues this is only half-right. Civilization and society are heavily associated with Order, especially it's good side. The good side of Order is represented by the Good or Just King. Laws basically uphold what is right, good, competent people usually do better than wicked ones, if you need help, there are folks to turn to who can give it, if you have something you need to do, someone can tell you how to do it.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the other hand, too much Order, or the wrong sort, or even Order that used to be helpful, but now no longer applies, can all become the bad side of Order, the Tyrant. Laws catch you in a tangled web that makes it impossible to do anything without breaking one of them, folks advance more for knowing which boxes to check and what forms to fill out than from competence, if you need help, only properly licensed, authorized, and monitored officials can help you, and if you have something you need to do, you damn well better do it the way everyone else does, or else. If you have ever navigated an automated customer service menu to try to handle a straightforward request, only to have every choice you try take you back to the same (wrong) answer (or even worse, this happened with a live human slavishly following a script), then you know what Bad Order can look like.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga249b11"></a>The Kind Mother and the Devouring Beast - Chaos, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga249b11">
  <p>
  Again, we're facing a bit of bias from the language we use, as we tend to default to "Chaos is bad". The good side of Chaos, the "Kind Mother" archetype, we might instead call "possibility," or "fertility," or even "creativity". The idea is that the only place new things can come from is the unknown, the not-fully-organized, thus, the Chaotic. Good Chaos is also receptive in the good sense - it welcomes you, it responds to your exploration of it, it reveals knowledge and treasures when you ask politely.
  </p>

  <p>
  The bad side of Chaos, the Devouring Beast/Mother, is everything bad about the unknown, the unorganized, the untamed. Beasts in the wilderness, dragons in caves, child-eating witches in gingerbread houses, all of these are manifestations of Bad Chaos. But then, so is the criminal, the outlaw, the raider. Bad Chaos is also receptive in the bad sense - it envelops you, it gives you somewhere to get lost in, it reveals how little you truly know and how insecure your treasures are.
  </p>

  <p>
  Interestingly, the earth (as in, the ground) plays both of these roles. The earth is where the plants we eat grow out of, where the animals we eat roam, and it holds the water we drink. On the other hand, it's also where forests full of lions, tigers, and bears grow, where outlaws and invaders lurk, and where our bones disappear into when we die. The sea can also play both roles (fish come from it, but you can drown in it).
  </p>
  </div>

  <li><a id="org4716525"></a>The Hero and the Villain - The Mediator, Good and Bad<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4716525">
  <p>
  Standing between Order and Chaos (whether Good, Bad, or Both) is the individual, the Mediator. This person stands for each of us as we read the story - he makes choices that we can reflect on, undergoes trials that we can sympathize with, and teaches us lessons about achieving goals (or failing to tragically). The Good Mediator is the Hero - an individual who shows wisdom, compassion, generosity, bravery, or any other noble qualities. The Hero recognizes and values the gifts of Good Order and Good Chaos, and bravely confronts the depredations of Bad Order and Bad Chaos. Maybe most importantly, the Hero <i>balances</i> Order and Chaos appropriately - if things have become too rigid, he brings in the rejuvenation of Chaos, if things have become too wild, he brings in the steadying of Order.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Bad Mediator is then, of course, the Villain, the flip side of the same coin. There's a reason for the stereotype of "we're not so different, you and I. . ." - in a good story, the Hero and the Villain <i>do</i> have much in common. Both face an uncertain world full of risks and rewards, both see the interaction of Order and Chaos in their world and try to take some action to put it more to their liking, and both serve to remind us, the reader/listener, <i>what people are like</i>. In many old stories, they are literally brothers. Where the hero displays noble qualities, though, the villain shows some or all of the ignoble: folly, cruelty, selfishness, cowardice, and more. Where the Hero finds balance, the Villain is more likely to tilt things <i>further</i> out of whack, or to swing the pendulum too far the other way. Often, the villain sees only the bad side of one, the other, or both of Order and Chaos. At his worst, the Villain believes that Being itself is wrong and should be undone, the ultimate nihilism.

  </li>

  <li><a id="org000bade"></a>A Couple of Examples, to Make this Clear<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org000bade">
  <p>
  Alright, so, like I said, the trouble with abstractions is that if you don't have specific instances to link them to, they can be so vague as to be unhelpful. So let's go through a couple of examples.
  </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgabea61c"></a>Story/Mythic Example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgabea61c">
  <p>
  One of Peterson's favorite examples, and a film I've come to appreciate more thanks to his exegesis of it, is <i>The Lion King</i>. If you somehow haven't seen it, I suppose I should warn you that here be spoilers. Simba is obviously the Hero, the Good Mediator figure. Mufasa is obviously the Good King/Kind Father, and thus the positive side of Order. Scar kind of plays double duty as the Bad Mediator (Villain), as well as embodying the Tyrant, Bad Order. Nala somewhat takes on the role of Good Chaos by being one hell of a surprise to Simba when she finds him, and starting him on his path back to Pride Rock. And the hyenas are then Bad Chaos (though interestingly, put to work on behalf of Bad Order). The landscape also takes on some of these roles. The Elephant Graveyard, the barren desert that Simba first escapes to, the Pride Lands when they've been screwed up under Scar's rule, all of these are Bad Chaos. The Pride Lands at the beginning and end of the story and the lush paradise Timon and Pumba take Simba to are places of Good Chaos. You can also see how the different archetypes manifest in the same character at different times - young Simba is brave and loyal (Good Mediaor), but full of himself and a bit foolish (Bad Mediator). Teenage Simba is kind and protective of his friends (Good Mediator), but he's deeply afraid and avoids responsibility (Bad Mediator). Adult Simba acknowledges his responsibility and admits what he has done wrong to try to save his people (Good Mediator), but lets himself fall for Scar's manipulations (Bad Mediator). He also shows alternation between how much Chaos and how much Order he represents, and whether it's good or bad. As a rambunctious, rule-breaking child, he embodies Bad(ish) Chaos, but as the one who brings the rains back, Good Chaos. In his desire to boss people around and have his ego flattered ("I Just Can't Wait to Be King!"), he shows Bad Order, but by deposing the Tyrant and restoring just rule to the Pride Lands, he shows Good Order.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, you can see how the application of these archetypes in different ways, and the interplay between them, can lead to a fairly rich and nuanced set of insights into a story.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orgcb4e4a2"></a>"Real Life" example<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcb4e4a2">
  <p>
  Okay, stories are well and good, but if you're not yet convinced that understanding stories better will help us understand ourselves and how to live our lives better, then an example of how to apply these archetypes to a story like the one above won't do much for you. So, let me run through how we could use these to think about situations in our lives.
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's say you're stuck in a job that makes you miserable. The economy sucks and you're worried about finding another job (Bad Chaos). Your boss is a micromanaging jerk who takes credit for anything good the team does, and passes blame for anything bad (Bad Order). But even worse, the team is a mess - there are no standard procedures to follow, no one knows who is responsible for what, and your boss is constantly dropping surprise last-minute assignments on you (Bad Chaos). You've gotten to the point where you try to avoid as much responsibility as you can and lie about how much work you're doing (Bad Mediator), because trying to do better has just gotten you burned in the past. Your only relief is to spend your weekends either playing video games for hours on end or getting hammered - or both (Bad Mediator).
  </p>

  <p>
  One day, you've had enough, and you decide you're going to put your life back on a track that suits you better (Good Mediator). You realize that one reason you feel stuck is that you don't have the skills you need to get a job somewhere else, so you sign up for a course (Good Mediator). Through the course, you meet some folks who are also looking for work, and you start to hear about opportunities you'd never considered (Good Chaos). You decide that you're going to create a habit of applying to 5 new jobs a week until you find a new one (Good Order). Once you land the new job, you politely, but firmly, tell your boss that you're leaving and it's because this place is terrible (Good Mediator), and you have a very candid exit interview with HR, hoping that maybe the company can be a little better to work for, even if you're gone (Good Order). As you get ready for your first day on the new job, you're a little nervous, but mostly you're excited, because now you know that if it doesn't work out, you can always find something else (Good Chaos).
  </p>

  <p>
  Alright, so that wasn't the most detailed or interesting scenario, but hopefully it gives some idea of how these ideas can play out in your life. More importantly, once you've learned to think that way, you can start analyzing situations in your life through this lens - where do you feel stifled (Bad Order)? Where do you feel overwhelmed by uncertainty (Bad Chaos)? Where do you act like a jerk (Bad Mediator)? Where do you help others out (Good Mediator)? Where do you have helpful routines (Good Order)? Where do you feel excited about unexplored possibilities (Good Chaos)?
  </p>

  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><a id="orga4e238b"></a>Some Shortcomings of Peterson's Way, as I See Them<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga4e238b">
  <p>
  Having spent all these words laying out why I think Peterson's framework is helpful, you might (rightly) guess that I'm a big fan. Even still, no framework is foolproof, and this one is no exception. For me, the biggest challenge in using this framework is the level of abstraction discussed above - the fact that it can be applied to <i>any</i> story means that it's missing some of the nuance that it might be helpful to highlight. One example: Jung identified the archetype of the Magician/Wise Old Man, and Campbell noticed how very common that figure was in the "Hero's Journey" mythic storyline. Where does the Magician fit in here? Well, he's kinda-sorta Good Chaos, because he deals with the unknown, but he's also kinda-sorta Good Order, because he often provides wisdom and guidance to the young hero, and he's kinda-sorta the mediator because he helps the hero understand and deal with balancing Order and Chaos. The point is, having a "Magician" archetype you can talk about is often helpful, and it doesn't fit as neatly into the higher-level abstraction of Peterson's framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  Perhaps more fundamentally, let's return to the Nietzschean motivation for this whole project in the first place, which we summarized (and somewhat oversimplified) as "if God is dead, why do His stories keep shaping what we find meaningful?" This is making a few pretty big assumptions, though: what about the wide swaths of the world that get by just fine with other bases for their morality? What about folks who still have active, meaningful spiritual experiences and don't feel like (the) God(s) is (are) dead at all? In these cases, I think Peterson's analysis still has much to offer, but his need to ground out this analysis in materialistic explanations compatible with a scientific understanding sometimes bleeds through.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org6c88c2b"></a>With These Thoughts, Hopefully You Can More Readily Engage with Peterson's Work<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c88c2b">
  <p>
  So, here we are. Peterson's framework is fairly high-level, fairly abstract, but because of this, it's pretty versatile. It's a bit like a Swiss Army Knife of story/myth interpretation - in the long run, you might get far more out of a myth or story through other ways of looking into it deeply, but this gives you a handy starting place, especially for those stories that otherwise seem opaque. Is there a female character? Maybe she represent Chaos, Good, Bad, or mixed. Can the main character's actions be interpreted as balancing Order and Chaos? What about representatives of Order - are they acting more just and protecting, or more tyrannical and controlling? I like to think of this method as a kind of prybar for getting into the underlying meaning of a story - it might not help you fully unpack it, but it can almost always help you get started.

  </p>

  <p>
  So, I'm getting close on my "Hail Idun", but I can tell I'm not <i>right</i> there yet.
  Divination has suggested that I ought to go with a single stanza of Galdralag
  (two four-line half stanzas), and a few of the images/themes I should/shouldn't
  include. These poems/prayers are highly personal, but I'm also trying to make
  sure they work for other folks, so I'm going to share three variants I'm
  thinking over below, and I'd very much welcome your thoughts on what bits work,
  what don't, and what I might change. As I've said before, whatever I land on for
  this prayer will be the beating heart of my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, so I want to get it
  right.
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org0efe3d5"></a>Way 1<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0efe3d5">

  </p>
  <p>
  Blessed Idun,<br>

  Goddess ale-giving,<br>
  Quench our thirst for thee.<br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org13174fa"></a>Way 2<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org13174fa">
  <blockquote>
  <p>

  <li><a id="org211b60e"></a>Way 3<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org211b60e">

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1ff2aea">
  <p>
  Again, it would be a great help if you can share your thoughts on any of the above, most of all if the wording of any bits works better than others - whether to pick one or another, whether to blend them together, or whether to start all over again. Thanks very much, and I hope you find something helpful here.

  <title>Opening Thoughts on Beauty</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2023-February-19
  </p>

  <p>
  This is very much a "start writing to work things out and see where takes you"
  kind of post, or even more so, series of posts, I'm sure. The more I think about
  and reflect on the role of aesthetic taste in questions of meaning, metaphysics,
  and even ethics, the more weighty it seems to be. I know that it's far from an
  original thought to be like "whoah, maybe beauty is a transcendental virtue" (as
  in, "Plato talked about this, and it wasn't new then" unoriginal). Even still,
  it's a line of thinking I'm trying to work out for myself, and I think maybe
  talking it over with you will help with that. Hopefully you'll at least bear
  with me, and with any luck, I'll share something you find helpful.
  </p>

  <p>
  In my head, this feels like a coherent, even simple idea, but whenever I find
  myself trying to explain it, I see that it is actually huge, messy, and touches
  nearly everything else. I had been thinking I should read more about this and
  wait to write about it until I had digested more folks' thoughts, but one of the
  things I'm trying to make myself do with these weekly blog posts is to do more
  of my thinking "out loud", both since it lets me get more feedback from others,
  but also since it makes me get it down in some more-or-less definite form, which
  often makes it clear where my thinking is fuzzy, derivative, or otherwise not
  what I'd like it to be. So, here's my attempt at a short version: our sense of
  what is aesthetic, what is beautiful, what is pleasing is <i>central</i> to our ability
  to sort out what is best and most meaningful in life. It's not the <i>only</i> thing
  around that, but it's one of the very weighty things.
  </p>

  <p>
  What do I mean by this, exactly? If you have a philosophy that makes good sense
  to you and you can back up logically, but it leaves you cold, it's almost
  certainly <i>not</i> your path to a truly meaningful and good life. Likewise, if there
  is something that stirs you deeply, but you can't truly say why, you likely
  ought to follow it. I suspect, but don't yet have any way to make my case, that
  our sense of what "looks right" or "feels right" or "is beautiful" is a very
  deep synthesis of many factors, including some that are very important, but very
  hard to access consciously. An analogy I can draw on from experience: if you've
  ever learned to draw human bodies, then there are certain proportions in a
  drawing that you will just expect to see, and if you don't, you'll be like
  "something is wrong with this drawing, I don't like it". On the other hand,
  there are certain ways real human proportions can be exaggerated or manipulated
  for pleasing artistic effect (think the giant eyes that anime borrowed from
  Disney cartoons). With enough muscle memory of drawing correctly proportioned
  anatomy, getting the proportions wrong just "feels" off, even if you can't say
  exactly why. Now, you might argue that such drawing doesn't carry much moral or
  spiritual weight, and you're likely right, but it's a very clear cut example of
  somewhere that a lot of internalized knowledge due to practice, observation, and
  feedback leads to a situation where that internalized knowledge is perceived as
  "it just doesn't feel right". I suspect that most aesthetic perception of the
  sort "I dunno, I just like it" or "that just sounds off to me" is, in fact, the
  same kind of deeply internalized knowledge from repeated exposure and judgment.
  </p>

  <p>
  One nice thing about this way of thinking about aesthetics is that it helps us
  get around the always-present and always-thorny problem of "what about sexual
  attraction, though?" If you haven't run into this, here's how it goes: "The idea
  of 'beauty' is clearly somehow related to the concept of sexual attraction, but
  there are beautiful things that have nothing to do with sex, so what gives?"
  This is an especially telling point if your primary basis for understanding
  aesthetics, or even all of human psychology, is an evolutionary one, where sex
  gets the starring role. So how does my proposal above address this? Well, if we
  take "aesthetic judgment" to mean something like "the qualitative feeling that
  something you observe is suitable or not suitable to the purpose for which
  you're evaluating it, whether or not you can articulate the drivers for that
  judgment," then all of a sudden the link between sexual attraction and aesthetic
  beauty becomes easy to define. If a judgment of something as aesthetically
  "beautiful" is the positive feeling you get for something that you're pretty
  sure will "work", even if you don't know why, then seeing someone that will
  "work" for you sexually, even if you can't articulate why, will present in a
  very similar way. Add in the fact that the sex drive is super important to most
  folks, and this becomes an area of aesthetic judgment that almost everyone
  exercises every day, all the time. So, by this logic, it's not that aesthetic
  beauty is some ramification or epiphenomenon of sexual attraction, it's that
  your judgment of sexual attractiveness is just your best exercised aesthetic
  muscle (if you're anything like most folks).
  </p>

  <p>
  Okay, my thoughts could go a lot of different directions from here, but that
  actually got me to a new conclusion (I hadn't worked out that judgment of sexual
  attractiveness is a <i>subset</i> of aesthetic judgment, rather than something
  foundational or ancestral to it). So, I think I'll wrap things up for now. Some
  directions I'd like to go here: what to make of evil aesthetic judgments (it is
  <i>pleasing</i> to torture this person)? Can you arrive at ethically defensible
  positions without bringing in aesthetics? Can aesthetics lead you astray? What
  role have aesthetic judgments played in my own spiritual growth? All these and
  more lead me to want to write many more posts, but I have no idea when they'll
  come out.

  </p>

  <p>
  Today is my birthday, so I'm going to go ahead and take one of my "steadholders"
  for the year. I had hoped to get a new take on the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#the_hail_idun_prayer">Hail Idun</a> prayer in
  Germanish meter, but my first few drafts aren't doing it for me, and since
  it will be the beating heart of the <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I want to get it right.
  Instead, a few things I've been thinking about:
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li>38 truly feels a lot closer to 40 than 37, but even that was "not my
  'mid-thirties' anymore." I've always sought to not get too hung up on youth
  and my age, and to know and accept my own looming death, but it didn't fully
  hit me until 2018 when my mother passed away and my first daughter was born
  within a couple of months of each other. That was one hell of a shot of
  "you're only one step in the ongoing march of life" all at once.</li>
  <li>My older daughter is doing her bit to make me feel the full weight of
  growing older. Yesterday, she asked me "Daddy, are you an old man?" and I
  said "no, not yet, but I'm on my way there." So, she said "will you be an
  old man tomorrow?" and again "no, not just yet." "Well, when will you be an
  old man?" "Not for a while, honey."</li>
  <li>More earnestly, my deepening spiritual work has been a big help with
  acknowledging and dealing with my feelings about getting older. I truly
  don't know where I'd be had the last few years gone otherwise. These days,
  my only regret is that I didn't find this path sooner, but I keep telling
  myself it's not a race, there's no prize for "doing more," it's not about
  what's at the end of the path, it's all about walking it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  With that said, I put forth my blessings to you and hope the coming year treats
  you wonderfully.

  <b>Date</b>: 2023-February-05
  </p>

  <p>
  The very first book that I dug into after my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#thoughts_on_spending_a_year_with_the_dead">year with dead writers</a> was <i>The
  Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine Feminine Hidden in the Rosary</i> by
  Clark Strand and Perdita Finn. Someone had spoken well of it on a <a href="https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/183049.html?thread=29927177#cmt29927177">Magic Monday</a>
  over on JMG's dreamwidth journal, and it sounded like it would be
  helpful to me in my <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a> work. Overall, I found the book helpful and
  thought-stirring, but below, I share my thoughts in more depth.
  </p>

  <p>
  In a nutshell, the book makes the case that the Rosary is a very helpful tool
  for spiritual growth and healing that need not be only for Catholics, or even
  Christians. The book is written with one chapter for every bead on a stock
  Rosary, and the chapters are grouped by the old mysteries (so no "Luminous
  mysteries"). Through these chapters, the writers put forth that the Rosary
  represents a very, very old strand of Goddess worship squelched by the church
  that nevertheless found its way into folks' daily practice. They give some
  slightly changed ways of saying the prayers to make them a bit more welcoming
  for those who are not Christians. They also give some thoughts on how to pray,
  such as getting together in "Rosary Groups". The bulk of the book speaks of the
  writers' own spiritual paths with the Rosary: coming to it through
  "coincidences" and visions, deepening connection with it, and some "whoah, this
  [stuff] works" moments. Along the way, they talk about how the Rosary came to be
  and what has happened with it, of the Church, of religion more broadly, and
  their own backgrounds in spiritual seeking. If any of this sounds like it might
  be interesting, read on!
  </p>

  <p>
  I said at the start that my goal in reading this book was to deepen my
  understanding of the Rosary as a step on the way to crafting my "Heathen
  Rosary", and weirdly enough, this book might as well have been written for that
  very end. Okay, okay, not <i>wholly</i> that, but their way of talking about the Rosary
  was remarkably helpful to me in a few ways. First, the weight they put on the
  Rosary as a way of getting a hold of the "Divine Feminine", but matched with
  calls to the "Divine Masculine", lined up with one of my gut-feelings about what
  makes the Rosary work so well. Next, my way of working has been to "back-craft"
  the Rosary, to work on understanding what makes it tick beyond "it's
  contemplation while saying the same prayers over and over with beads to keep
  track". As such, their use of a <i>almost</i> the stock Rosary, but with a <i>very</i> unalike
  theological understanding and goal, meant that a lot of their insights were
  worthwhile to me. Lastly, the book highlights the slow, steady insight and
  wisdom that comes from ongoing work, even if you don't know why/how/whether it's
  working, which matches how spiritual practice has worked out for me so far.
  </p>

  <p>
  To take these as they were named, the first thing was weighty enough to show up in the
  under-name (subtitle) of the book: the Rosary is a way of getting in
  touch with the "Divine Feminine." While this was one of the main
  ways the book was helpful to me, it also touches on one of the book's biggest drawbacks for me, which is that the writers seem to believe something like "all Goddesses are one Goddess". As such, they see worship of
  mother Goddesses in the paleolithic caves of France, the Eleusinian Mysteries, and
  praying the Rosary all as unalike ways of giving prayer and worship to the same holy Being. This
  is what is sometimes called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LSd3iLCUtU">soft polytheism</a>, which I think is
  likely an overly shallow take on what's going on in the spiritual world. This hurdle is fairly readily dealt with, but
  it's also there throughout the whole book.  Even so,
  I think they rightly mark out some threads of what worship for feminine
  beings is like and bring those threads out clearly in the Rosary and what it has
  to teach. What kind of things do I mean? Things like kindness, forgiveness, open-heartedness, and
  wisdom. The book doesn't highlight as much the matching (not to say equal weight)
  between the masculine and feminine held in the Rosary. Each decade of ten "Hail Marys" opens
  with an "Our Father" and closes with a "Glory Be" (which calls upon the Father,
  the Son, and the Holy Ghost) - so you can see that Mary (the feminine) is very
  much at the heart of the practice, but with a weighty masculine match. I
  think it likely that this is a weighty bit of what makes the Rosary so mighty
  spiritually, and I want to have the same overall take for my Heathen Rosary.
  </p>

  <p>
  Next, this book is indeed helpful for my "back-crafting" work, since it takes the Rosary earnestly, but is not bound by Catholic theology or
  doctrine. This opens the writers up to insights about how it works and what it's
  doing that a Catholic might either not heed or else make match up with the overall shape of their
  set of beliefs. For one ready showdeal, the set of prayers for the Rosary given in the book
  leaves out the Apostle's Creed at the beginning, because that is a downright
  affirmation that "yes, I believe the things Christianity has to teach" and puts
  the whole prayer in that framework. A Catholic likely deems that a needful
  bit, where Strand and Finn see it as a "lock" put on the gate to keep
  out those the Church wouldn't want saying "its" prayer. Likewise, in talking through the
  mysteries to be contemplated while praying the Rosary, a Catholic like de
  Montford will strongly ground them in the wider framework of Catholic theology, with
  a lot of steering on what a right understanding of each mystery might be.
  This work, on the other hand, looks at the mysteries as one set of tales showing
  wider spiritual truths. You don't have to believe that 2,000 years ago a Rabbi's
  dead body woke up and walked out of a cave to find loveliness, meaning, and Truth of
  a less straightforward kind in the tale of the rebirth. I'm most of all thankful
  that the writers spelled out how both the mysteries and the words of the "Hail Mary" go from life to suffering to death
  to rebirth. I may not want my Heathen Rosary to go through the same steps, but I
  do want the same kind of deep, framing resonances between the
  prayers themselves and the overall practice. To bring in an
  overly-leaned-upon forlikening (metaphor): this book has worked like a Rosetta Stone for the Rosary for
  me - rather than needing to translate from Catholic to Heathen with nothing in
  between, I can see what translating the Rosary into other spiritual "tongues"
  looks like, which is helpful.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thirdly, the book spoke to a way of coming at spiritual growth that I seem to need to work on -
  steadfast, bit-by-bit unfolding of wisdom and insight through ongoing work. To
  fully share what I mean, I might have to lay out a bit about myself. Growing
  up, I was always a "smart kid" - I understood things quickly, soaked up new
  knowledge, and otherwise was ready to do things with my mind. I say
  this not to brag, as you'll see, but to highlight that I was (and largely still
  am) "brainy", maybe to the harm of other ways of knowing and understanding
  the world. This was made painfully clear to me in the aftermath of my mother
  passing away from cancer.  Mind-wise, I had settled myself with what had
  happened, what it meant to me, how I should think and feel about it, and I
  thought I was alright. But I was not alright. My wife at last got me to go talk to a
  therapist, and through that and some of my own looking back, I had the insight
  that I was so wont to being able to think my way through things, to use my mind
  to handle stuff in my life, that I thought my feelings would play by the same
  rules, to answer to the same ways of doing things. In the same way that as a kid in math class, after doing a few problems I "got" how to bring to bear the principle
  and found further going over boring and unneeded, I thought that reading a few
  books, thinking about what happened in a few other folks' lives  meant that I "got" grief
  and could go about my business with that little hardship cleanly worked out. As will
  no doubt be blindingly clear to you, unless you share the same quirk of which
  I've been telling, this is not at all how grief or any other weighty feeling
  works. You have to, you know, truly <i>feel</i> it, and that takes time and cannot
  be bossed around by the words in your head. What does work is daily, plodding
  work, over and over again, whether you're "feeling it" this time or not. Whether
  prayer, meditation, journaling, or whatever other spiritual practice, every time
  I have buckled down and done it no matter what, <i>that</i> is where I have been gifted
  with worthwhile spiritual experiences. The book had a lovely quote on coming at
  the Rosary in this way:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Rosary wisdom tends to grow slowly, building gradually over the course of a
  lifetime. The rosary isn't a degree program. There are no classes or courses.
  There's no diploma at the end. There isn't any end. We never stop accumulating
  the wisdom of the rosary. The beads turn, the seasons pass. The experiences of a
  lifetime settle within us like fallen leaves and flowers, becoming the top-soil
  that nourishes and informs our lives.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Overall, I found this book insightful and helpful, and I'm very glad I read it.
  That being said, it won't grab everyone alike. For starters, if the Rosary holds
  no spiritual or aesthetic appeal for you, I doubt that this book will change
  that. For another, Strand and Clark are coming at this from an openly "feminist"
  outlook, which brings along with it ways of framing and understanding things
  that you may or may not find helpful. One showdeal is their strong dislike and
  wariness of hierarchy, most of all those mostly made up of men, as seen when
  they speak rather harshly of "religion" many times in the book. By "religion"
  they seem to mean any group with any hierarchy given to spiritual ends. Another
  showdeal is that in a few steads they treat masculine ways of understanding or
  dealing with the world as childish or mistaken, things that need to be outgrown
  or put aside, rather than matched with feminine ways for a healthy whole. For
  both of these showdeals, they share things they have lived through that make it
  rather understandable how they would come to this way of looking at the world,
  including some truly wretched dealings with so-called spiritual teachers, but I
  still think they've "learned too much" from those happenings. Lastly, they speak
  in rather apocalyptic words about the way the world is going - it's not so much
  that I doubt things things are going to go poorly, but rather that I don't
  foresee the sudden and utter outcomes held in apocalyptic thinking about what
  may come. I think a slow, ragged <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-long-descent-a-user-s-guide-to-the-end-of-the-industrial-age-john-michael-greer/15681939?ean=9781945810282">descent</a> is a far more likely forecast.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, if you'd like to learn more about the Rosary from a truly not-Christian
  way of looking at the world, or maybe work at understanding some of what folks have
  found in praying the Rosary, this book's a great way to do that.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Date</b>: 2023-January-29
  </p>

  <p>
  In my ongoing work on a <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#why_a_heathen_rosary">Heathen Rosary</a>, I hit upon the thought that I ought to have something much like the Christian "Sign of the Cross" - a quick prayer and bodily token of self-blessing and warding. As with much of this undertaking, I started from the thought that Christian, most of all older kinds of Christian, tradition has much that works well, and maybe it doesn't <i>only</i> work for Christian beliefs. The things that drew me to the Sign of the Cross were 1. it is rather short, 2. in that short length, it calls upon a whole, balanced holiness, and 3. it is linked with energy centers in the subtle body. These hallmarks let the Sign of the Cross be something that Christians use both day-to-day (before and after longer prayers, when coming to the altar, and so forth) and also "as needed", such as coming across something dreadful or grasping that a statement ought to have been a prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, I set about coming up with such a short prayer-with-gesture that works for my own beliefs and worship. What I came up with largely came from intuition, meditation, prayer, and divination. I haven't tested it out much yet, so if anyone else finds this helpful, I'd love to hear from you. Let me break down how I matched up the bits I laid out above:
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>To make it short, I settled on <i>Galdralag</i> <a href="https://jpowellrussell.com/#rules_of_germanish_meter">meter</a>. I also tried out some others, such as four lines of <i>Anglo-Saxon Long Lines</i>, but those felt a bit long for what I was looking for.</li>
  <li>To get a whole, balanced likeness of the spiritual world, I began with the thought of the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>. As I worked on this and meditated, though, it came to me to instead focus mainly on the three wells from which the World Tree's roots drink - in Old Norse, <i>Hvergelmir</i>, <i>Mimisbrunnr</i>, and <i>Urdabrunnr</i> (more on these below when I talk about the words I picked).</li>
  <li>For the energy centers, I drew on those marked out in John Michael Greer's Druidic magical systems, such as that laid out in his <i>Druid Magic Handbook</i>. These are the "womb center" about an inch below the belly button, the "third eye" between the eyebrows, and the heart center (unsurprisingly, at the heart).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  Again, I got to much of this in a way I can't wholly spell out in a way I can back up, but it feels pretty strong to me nonetheless.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, what of the prayer itself? As I said, I used <i>Galdralag</i>, and here's what I came up with:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  From seething hwer<sup>1</sup>,//
  Woden's drink,//
  and Wyrd's holy well,//
  Mighty tree unmatched.
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  <i>1 An Old English word meaning "boiler, cauldron"</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  A few thoughts on the words I picked. First, "hwer" was a bit of an odd one, but I couldn't land on a translation of <i>Hvergelmir</i> I liked much. <i>Hwer</i> is the direct cognate with Old Norse <i>hver</i>, a word for a pot or a kettle. The <i>gelmir</i> bit is cognate with "yelling", but "Yelling Pot" just doesn't have much of a ring to it in English, to say nothing of making the alliteration work. The sense of <i>Hvergelmir</i> seems to be something like churning rapids, or a steaming, boiling hot spring. "Woden's Drink" is a pretty straightforward kenning for Meomer's (<i>Mimir's</i>) Well, the well of wisdom that Woden gave his eye to drink from. Wyrd's holy well is, of course, the Old Norse <i>Urdhabrunnr</i>, Wyrd being a direct cognate for <i>Urdh</i>. The "mighty tree unmatched" is, also of course, the World Tree, <i>Yggdrasil</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, here's how I've been doing it:
  </p>
  <ol class="org-ol">
  <li>Take 2 fingers and put them about an inch below your belly button and say "From seething hwer,"</li>
  <li>Move your fingers to the spot between your eyebrows and say "Woden's drink,"</li>
  <li>Move your fingers to your heart and say "and Wyrd's holy well, Mighty tree unmatched."</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  This ought to work for Heathen's who'd like an all-around self-blessing/warding to say before and/or after prayer, when running into wicked things, and so forth. I'll start using it, and I'll let you know what I find out.
  </p>

  <title>List of Books on Germanish Belief with Thoughts</title>

  </p>

  <p>
  I very much like when a writer shares not only the books that they read, but also what they think of them - an "annotated bibliography". I may not have a book of my own (yet), but I do have a big ol' list of books I have read or want to read on Germanish belief, and I thought I'd share it. As I get to the books I haven't read on this list, I might come back and add my thoughts on them. If you know of any books you think ought to be on the list, kindly let me know! For now, I'll share my thoughts either from reading the book, or what I know about it that makes me want to read it.
  </p>

  <p>
  Also, it ought to go without saying, but given the times we live in, I'll say it anyhow: my putting a book on the list below does not mean I agree with it in whole or in part - it only means that I think it might have some insights on understanding the field it's about. 
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="orgdefeb0c"></a>Wellsprings of the Lore<br />
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdefeb0c">
  <p>
  These are the elder works that everything else builds upon. Mostly written down by Christians, and mostly written sometime after folks worshiped the Germanish Gods and Goddesses, we are nevertheless lucky to have far more to work with than the beliefs of many other lands. These works show us a tantalizing glimpse of the wider world of Gods, Goddesses, elves, dwarves, and other wights that the folks of Germanish lands lived in before the coming of Christianity.
  </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="org-ul">
  <li><a id="org7c8632c"></a>The Prose Edda<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7c8632c">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Snorri Sturlusson <br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes, more than once, from many translators<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is <i>the</i> book to read on Old Norse mythology. If you read nothing else, read this one. Helpfully put-together and makes good sense, maybe <i>too</i> much sometimes, but most of the "summaries of Old Norse Mythology" below are mostly restatements of this. More than one good translation out there, but I like the Jesse Byock one or Jackson Crawford's.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org0680cba"></a>The Poetic Edda<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0680cba">
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Many writers<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: In many ways, this is even more grounded than <i>The Prose Edda</i>, but it's harder to follow if you haven't already read Sturlusson's learned summary. Jackson Crawford's translation is helpfully literal, Lee Hollander's has a delightful Germanish taste thanks to the words he uses, and Maria Kvilhaug's take in her book <i>Seed of Yggdrasil</i> (see below) gives the meaning of the proper names, which is a big help to understanding.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org00a101a"></a>The Sagas of the Icelanders<br />
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org00a101a">
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some of it<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: I have a lovely collection of <i>all</i> of the sagas in translation, available <a href="https://sagas.is/yfirlit.htm">here</a>. These works give a lot of hints about what pre-Christian belief and worship looked like, but it takes some amount of combing to make the most of them.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org2a94db4"></a>Germania<br />

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Tacitus<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Bits<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is maybe our oldest written take on what the Germanish folks of the time believed and did for worship. It has the great strength of <i>not</i> being written by Christians, which gives a very different look at things.
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>

  <li><a id="org2fed551"></a>Gesta Danorum<br />

  </p>
  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Saxo Grammaticus <br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This re-tells many of the stories found in the <i>Prose Edda</i> and tells a few others not known elsewhere, but through the "euhemerization" lens. Basically, Saxo believes that the Heathen lore was a garbled way of talking about normal humans that lived in the world. So, he needs to be taken with lots of salt, but he shares a lot that can't be found elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Snorri Sturlusson<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No]]
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is a history of the kings of Norway and Sweden written by the same heavy hitter who gave us the <i>Prose Edda</i>. Though written as a "history," the older bits likely draw on beliefs from before Christianity. For translations, Lee Hollander's is good, but there are very many.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Some<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: This is the very kind of workhorse book that everyone else is lucky to have when someone goes to the trouble to put it together. It brings together short outcuttings (excerpts) from Classical and Medieval Christian sources on Germanish Heathens (so, pretty much everything other than the Germanish Poetry that we have about the Heathenry of elder times). My one gripe is that it doesn't give the Latin or Greek, only the words wended (translated) into English.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Unknown, translated by J.R.R. Tolkien<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Not <i>only</i> a translation, this tells a coherent version of the story of Sigurd and Gudrun, which are told in multiple places in multiple languages. Tolkien put it together following the rules of Old Norse/Old English poetic meter in modern English, which makes for a lovely read. Mark that it's a bit of a stretch to call this a "wellspring", since Tolkien did much to work together bits that didn't readily fit together, and the words are his own poetry.

  There's a fairly large body of work in Old English, much of it poetry, but all written down by Christians. Even so, there are hints and clues to older belief salted throughout, and if nothing else, you can get an understanding of the folkways that kept going after switching over to Christianity that might help us understand what folks were like before Christianity..

  <b>Thoughts</b>: One of the many overviews of Old Norse lore. I have to confess that I have many of these, but have not much read them, as I feel like I already know most of what they hold. That being said, besides their main use (helping folks new to the lore get to know it), they are also helpful to more knowledgeable folks since they bring together in one stead what we know of the tales, beliefs, and worship about each God, the evidence for which might be spread across many works of elder times.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: I'm reading this at the time of putting this list together, and I'm finding it rather interesting. It seems that Bauschatz mostly uses linguistic evidence to argue that the speakers of Germanish tongues thought about time in a rather unalike way to how we do now or how Roman and Christian writers did, and that we misunderstand what myths meant when we put today's way of looking at time on to them. <i>Very</i> hard to find, but try your nearest university bookhoard.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: Unlike many of the books on this list, this one looks more to old <i>things</i> rather than old <i>words</i> - it goes over the archaeological evidence for the Gods of pre-Christian England. Some online reviews say that Branston is overly ready to see what he wants to see, but even if so, I would often rather have a writer willing to do that than one who is <i>so</i> careful with finding meaning that you are left with nothing useful for someone seeking to shape their own worship.

Enright lays out the evidence that Celtic and Germanish warbands of the <i>volkerwanderung</i> times had a role for a woman as seeress and initiator, and that you can see hints of this throughout the later lore, even as late as Beowulf. This seems rather weighty for understanding Germanish Goddesses, maybe Freyja most of all.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: You can say with much fairness that this monster work is the granddaddy of the whole field. Most folks only know about Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm for the fairy tales they gathered, and don't know that they were mostly gathering those tales to find hints about the Gods, lore, and beliefs of elder Germanish folks. While some of what Grimm puts forward has been deemed wrong by later writers, much of it holds up, and if nothing else, his writing is a nearly unbelievable <i>wealth</i> of clues to Germanish folkways, beliefs, lore, and worship beyond the obvious ones from the <i>Eddas</i> and <i>Sagas</i>.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: Many of the works for today's worshipers below mark out this book as somewhere to learn much about how the Germanish folks of elder times thought about the world. From what I've read, it seems that it is very much an outgrowth of its time, and holds a lot of the ways of thinking of the late 19th and early 20th century. All that being said, it seems to be a thoroughgoing take on getting at the thoughtworld of pre-Christian Germanish folks, rather than only understanding their tales or folkways.

Many of his books have only been translated into English in the last ten years or so, so I think he hasn't hit the English-speaking world as hard as the amount and worth of his work maybe should. I'm still only dipping my toes into his stuff, but it is wonderful to find someone talking about things I want to learn about, but coming at it from a wholly different grounding than what I already know.

He also strikes a balance between sharing what implications a bit of evidence might have, while being careful to call out what is well-grounded and what is more out-there. This book does a wonderful job of finding the links between the Old English evidence (often scant) and the Nordic lore that is so much more thorough. If your interest in Germanish lore, belief, or worship is at all Anglo-Saxon flavored, this book is well worth your time.

  To get the most out of works on belief and ways of worship, it is often helpful to know more about what life was like and what things were going on when those ways were widespread.

  This bit could likely be built out far more, most of all if I ever settle on taking on Old Norse or today's German. For now, this is weighted toward my liking of Old English. Mark also that this bit hold works on Runes as a way of writing rather than as a tool for magic. It's helpful to know that many "serious" folks whose field of learning is the Runes lean toward putting very little weight on their use for magic at all, ever, since they do not wish to be overly linked with folks today who seek to use the runes for magic. Make of that what you will.

  While not straightforwardly about Germanish belief, these works look into what we might know or guess about the forebearers that Germanish folks shared with other folks of Eurasia. These can be a wellspring of surprising insights, but should also be taken with the right amount of salt, for almost the whole field comes from folks going "this thing calls this other thing to mind", whether that be words that sound alike, tales that go along the same lines, or Gods that took similar worship. Professional men and women of learning work very hard to put these likenesses on the strongest footing they might, but at the end of the day, they make a call on what they deem believable and what not, so be careful taking any of their conclusions without giving them your own thought. Mark that if you start going down this path, then works of lore for <i>every other Indo-European folk</i> might have a bearing on what you can work out, but I've deemed those out of scope for this list, lest it grow to even more laughable length.

  <b>Thoughts</b>: A wonderful pulling-together of everything we had at the time this was printed on "where did the speakers of proto-Indo-European come from?" A lot of the genetic evidence hadn't been published yet, but this pulls together linguistic, archaeological, and comparative means to argue that the speakers of Proto-Indo-European came from the steppe just north of the Black Sea (modern-day Ukraine and Western Russia). Also a great example of how to make a multi-disciplinary argument thoroughly and fairly straightforwardly.

This take meets with some skepticism, but I haven't ever read it for myself to weigh it, which I ought to do.

  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: A book of "comparative poetics", rather than focusing only on similar thematic elements in the myths of unalike Indo-European folks, Watkins looks at the likenesses in how these folks came up with poems (mostly oral, but later, written down). He argues that you can arrive at a Proto-Indo-European myth about killing a dragon, that had common poetic elements that left traces for hundreds of years after.

  These books are written by folks who worship the Germanish Gods and/or do magic founded in Germanish ways. Unlike the Learned Works above, these often lean more heavily on what the writers themselves have seen, thought, felt, or done.

  The following couple of books (at the time of first writing this, both by Eirik Westcoat) are about poetry written for worship and/or magic. They also include some help in coming up with such poetry for yourself, which I have put to good use in my own soul-work.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Eirik Westcoat<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Yes<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: <i>Greatly</i> helpful work on prayers written following the ways of old Germanish poetry. Also holds <i>many</i> prayers written following such ways. A big help if you want to know either a) some prayers you might say to the Germanish Gods, or b) how to write your own prayers as a kind of poetry much like what pre-Christian worshippers used to the same ends.

  <b>By</b>: Eirik Westcoat<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: Much of it, but not Cover-to-Cover<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Much like his earlier work above, Westcoat here writes a lot of poetry to do with going through the course of study in <i>The Nine Doors of Midgard</i>. Especially helpful for those going after magical learning and/or worshiping Odin most of all.

  These books are more about "making stuff happen" and/or "learning about what might happen" using means that come from Germanish belief. Mostly that means the Runes used for divination or magical purposes, but there are some other linked ways of going about things as well.

  </p>
  <p>
  As I said above, "shamanism" is a word that gets used for many unalike things, but the ways of the folks who live about the North pole gave us the name, and I think it likely those ways left some mark on the ways of the Norse at least, and maybe the wider Germanish world. The books below are all by Raven Kaldera and/or Galina Krasskova, and they have a way of looking at things that is rather unlike other folks, so take with as much salt as seems right to you.

  <b>By</b>: Raven Kaldera &amp; Galina Krasskova<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: Their take is that the beliefs and ways of working with Gods and spirits of the Germanish folks were shaped by shamanic ways of working, and this is meant to be a "how to" for a modern seeker.

  <p>
  <b>By</b>: Raven Kaldera<br />
  <b>Have I Read It?</b>: No<br />
  <b>Thoughts</b>: One thing that makes Kaldera somewhat controversial amongst the worshipers of Germanish Gods is his worship of and working with the <i>Jotnar</i>, the "giants" of Norse myth. Most folks see these as hostile or at least indifferent beings, and worship of them as not a good idea, but Kaldera says otherwise.
