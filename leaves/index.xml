      <description>For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had somewhat sundered &amp;ldquo;selves&amp;rdquo; on the web - I had a blog and social media account for gaming, another blog and webstead for coaching and thoughts on business and getting more work done and such, and I&amp;rsquo;ve lurked around reading but not putting out there my interests in things like philosophy, mysticism, and religion. After listening to Naval Ravikant talk about why you want to welcome and make the most out of what you have that no one else does, and to Josh Waitzkin talk about how greatness comes from &amp;ldquo;embracing your funk&amp;rdquo;, I made up my mind to set that right - hence, here we are.</description>

      <description>Hello, dear reader, and thank you for stopping by this corner of my webstead. This is where I tell you how you can help me make some money from the stuff I put out here, if you feel so minded. I already am overwhelmingly thankful that you take the time to read my stuff, but if you choose to do any of the things below, it will help me to put more time and work into writing and sharing my thoughts.</description>

      <description>When you are first getting started learning a new field, it can be hard to thresh out the wheat from the chaff. Finding out the groundwork in a field is not too hard these days, what with wikipedia and nearly unending books at your finger tips, but if you can find someone with a way of looking at things that is very much their own, maybe even a bit weird - as long as they&amp;rsquo;re not a full-on crank - that is a great boon.</description>
