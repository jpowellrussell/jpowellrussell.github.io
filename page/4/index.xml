        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-06-16-fragility-robustness-and-antifragility/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/6/9/rethinking-risk-with-antifragile&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed a new way of looking at the concept of “risk” and our inability to scientifically define it. Today, we go a little deeper and break systems into three categories based on their exposure to volatility: fragile, robust, and antifragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to realize that volatility, time, and risk are really the same thing. This sounds bizarre, right? But let’s return to our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rationality.pdf&#34;&gt;least-worst definition of risk&lt;/a&gt;: “exposure to negative outcomes brought about by volatility.&amp;rdquo; With this in mind, we can see that given enough time, every possible extreme of volatility will be experienced. To return to our coffee mug example, if you leave that mug on a table in San Francisco, eventually an earthquake will knock it off and break it. So, the combination of its exposure to negative outcomes (falls make it break) plus time (eventually something will happen to knock it off) means that more time equals more likely that it is broken. I should point out, of course, that this concept is statistical and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical&#34;&gt;empirical&lt;/a&gt; in nature, which has three important implications: 1)it is only really valid probabilistically, 2) it can’t predict the outcome for any one single thing, and 3) it makes no theory-based claims as to why time will eventually break most coffee mugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that exposure is the most practical thing to care about, since it definitely matters and we can actually observe it. Contrast this with the other elements of “risk” usually considered - the timing or intensity of the outcomes concerned, which we can’t every really know ahead of time. WIth our focus squarely on exposure, we can now look at how to categorize systems based on exposure, and It turns out that there are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile. The first two will be familiar and intuitively obvious, but this last category is novel and thus gives Taleb’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto-ebook/dp/B0083DJWGO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1497559271&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=antifragile&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; its name. Let’s go through what each category means and give some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragile things are hurt by volatility - eventually something goes wrong and they break. The easy example we’ve been using is the coffee mug. An important concept that we’ve skipped over so far is that these categories are defined by their relationship with volatility, which can be changed by circumstances - it’s not an intrinsic quality, even though some things more inherently tend towards fragility than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this distinction, I like to think about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy&#34;&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt;. A brick sitting on top of a ladder has more potential energy than one sitting on the ground. Nothing about the brick changes except its relationship with the gravity well it’s sitting in. Likewise, with our coffee mug, if you wrapped it in bubble wrap, stuffed it in a box, put that box in a waterproof bag, then put that inside a nuke proof bunker filled with packing peanuts, it would be significantly less fragile than sitting on your coffee table, which is less fragile still than balancing on top of a stack of books as you try to open a door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most relevant real world examples are traditional stocks and artificial systems that are overly optimized. Sure, traditional stocks go up when volatility goes in their favor, but they go down when it goes down, and you need &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.360financialliteracy.org/Topics/Budgeting-Spending/Budgeting-and-Saving/Understanding-the-Math-of-Recovering-from-Losses&#34;&gt;bigger growth to offset your loss&lt;/a&gt;. Highly optimized systems, on the other hand, work great until they catastrophically don’t. These failures are usually due to an unforeseen change in environmental circumstance or an excess of predicted capacity. Traffic is a great example. Highways don’t get linearly slower as cars are added during rush hour - they go from zooming to standstill exponentially quickly as their capacity is exceeded. If you like guns, think about the (somewhat exaggerated) &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16&#34;&gt;difference between an M16 and an AK-47&lt;/a&gt;: an M16 is more accurate and generally higher functioning, but stops working after much less abuse than the less optimized, cruder AK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the AK-47 can be described as “more robust” or “less fragile” than the M16. Robust is usually considered the opposite of fragile, but that’s not quite accurate. Robust things are indifferent to volatility - shit happens and they abide. Volatility neither particularly hurts nor particularly helps them. Think of &lt;a href=&#34;http://s1.thingpic.com/images/u3/z7gW8yQ1gQAjKqq9Vmgcf47e.jpeg&#34;&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; in Paris - through centuries of wars, invasions, and revolutions, it has remained beautiful and solid and standing. Sure it’s a little rougher around the edges, but it’s not a pile of rubble. Nor is it larger or more beautiful or superior in some way. It simply is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to examples of increasing robustness in day to day life, I like to think about my finances and my schedule. As I mentioned before, I keep somewhat large cash savings around, because it makes me more indifferent to volatility. I can pay for the unexpected without indebting myself or scrambling around. Likewise, when scheduling, I build in buffers of time (a trick I originally learned in the army) so that if something unexpected happens (major accident on the freeway, a train stops traffic, there’s a marathon I didn’t know about - whatever) I still get there on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the star of the show, the most novel category: antifragile, the true opposite of fragile. Antifragile systems actually benefit from volatility - eventually something will happen that makes them better or stronger. These systems are most often found in nature. Think of your immune system: once you have chicken pox, you’re immune. Or your muscles: lift weights and you get stronger. Most interesting of all, look at evolution: species and even ecosystems get more efficient and better adapted to their environment over time by responding to the various stressors that come up due to volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is exciting and sounds like a super power, everyone immediately thinks “how can I be more antifragile?” Well, there’s good and bad news. First off, the bad news is that it is more applicable to systems than to individual entities. The good news is that we create &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking&#34;&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt; in our life constantly, and we can engineer those to be as antifragile as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb became wealthy by betting against the market with out of the money put options - when the financial crisis hit and the market tanked, those options paid off. He had no precise knowledge of when a crash would happen or how big it would be, but given enough time it would. So he constructed a system with &lt;a href=&#34;http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf&#34;&gt;convex exposure&lt;/a&gt; where he accepted finite, limited downside constantly for near unlimited upside in the event of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ourselves, it helps to remember that robust is usually a necessary stepping stone to antifragile. Remember the savings we talked about? Step 1 is you don’t care about negative outcomes. Step 2 is to create ways to actively benefit from them - such as by buying undervalued stocks when there is “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/contrarian-investing.asp&#34;&gt;blood in the streets&lt;/a&gt;” or setting up positions that automatically benefit like Taleb’s. Or you might find other ways that disorder in your life can benefit you - have something read or listen to whenever you find yourself unexpectedly delayed, for example. Another favorite of mine is to practice Jocko Willink’s habit of responding to all negative situations with “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8&#34;&gt;Good&lt;/a&gt;.” Or perhaps,  invest in business ideas that take advantage of the seemingly negative, like staffing agencies in a world of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/quit-your-job-2017/&#34;&gt;declining full time employment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basics of Taleb’s framework come pretty easy, but there is so much depth there. For example, I didn’t even touch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/a/taleb_n_1.html&#34;&gt;math&lt;/a&gt; behind it, because that’s not my forte. I promise that as you think about these concepts, you will begin seeing them in your life and trying to find ways to apply them. If you figure out anything interesting, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preventative Maintenance - Self Care Part 2</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-05-26-preventative-maintenance-self-care-part-2/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-05-26-preventative-maintenance-self-care-part-2/ -&lt;p&gt;We talked last time about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/5/18/the-bathtub-model-of-stress-self-care-part-1&#34;&gt;a theoretical model of stress&lt;/a&gt;, now I want to talk about a few of the best methods for preparing yourself to handle and dissipate stress over the long term. We’ll cover how exercise, diet, sleep, and mental tools can all insulate you against stress and deal with it once it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about before, and as you’re no doubt sick of hearing, exercise is the single best thing you can do to improve your ability to deal with stress across the board. Of course, this is in addition to all of the other health benefits you get from exercise, which I don’t need to belabor. So, how does exercise impact stress specifically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, when it comes to stress, regular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/managing-anxiety/exercise-stress-and-anxiety&#34;&gt;moderate to vigorous exercise seems to have the greatest impact&lt;/a&gt;, ideally &lt;a href=&#34;http://stresscourse.tripod.com/id57.html&#34;&gt;3-5 times a week&lt;/a&gt;. As an added bonus, frequent workouts &lt;a href=&#34;https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/study-physical-activity-impacts-overall-quality-sleep&#34;&gt;also help you sleep&lt;/a&gt; (see below for more on sleep). Now, sure, breaking a sweat and breathing hard 3-5 times a week is substantially more involved than the baseline I recommend in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/27/the-lazy-mans-guide-to-exercise&#34;&gt;The Lazy Man’s Guide to Exercise&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll want to start small and build if this is new to you. We’re in it for the long haul, here. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2016/05/09/the-secrets-of-gymnastic-strength-training/&#34;&gt;Coach Sommer&lt;/a&gt; says, “if you want to be a stud later, you have to be a pud now.” Some good ways to start small are to start incorporating increased physical activity into your daily life: take the stairs instead of the elevator, ride your bike to the bar instead of driving, go for a walk while you take your phone calls, that kind of thing. Lots of people get a lot out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wareable.com/fitness-trackers/the-best-fitness-tracker&#34;&gt;tracking their steps and heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re all about tracking and visibility here, so consider giving a gadget a try (mine’s finally in the mail as I write this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note on getting strenuous: people tend to hear “break a sweat, breathe hard, get your heart rate up” and assume that means “cardio,&amp;rdquo; which is really code for “jogging,” and then they throw up in their mouth a little. Wait, by people, I mean me - so if you hate running as much as I do, let me re-assure you there are lots of options. Go for a fast bike ride. Head to the dojo and roll. Box. Hell, stick to lifting and go for a moderately heavy routine with shorter rests. Just about anybody can find something that gets their heart pumping both literally and metaphorically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get yourself into good operating shape, sleep is neck and neck with exercise in terms of results. For sleep to help though, you need to get enough and it needs to be high quality. Ever slept all day after a fun night out and still felt tired and shitty? Then you know that all sleep is not created equal. That being said, shooting for more sleep is a good place to start for most of us, since high achievers tend to place sleep somewhere down there between “going to the dentist” and “filing your taxes” in terms of desirability and priority. Much like exercise, though, sleep is a force multiplier that will &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.si.com/nba/2017/05/22/andre-iguodala-credits-better-sleep-improved-performance&#34;&gt;improve your performance&lt;/a&gt; in every other area if you take it seriously. You need to be a bit strategic about how much sleep, though. As I first learned from a college roommate of mine, most people &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/remember-the-90-minute-rule-to-ensure-a-refreshing-nigh-1551241082&#34;&gt;sleep in roughly 90 minute cycles&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s a good idea to chunk your available sleep accordingly - you might actually be better with 6 hours than 6.5 hours if you can’t get to 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That covers “enough” sleep, so where does “high quality” come in? For starters, you’ll sleep better if you exercise and eat healthy, but that’s gotta sound pretty old by now. A slightly less obvious one is to avoid alcohol too close to bed, which may sound counter-intuitive as alcohol is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nosleeplessnights.com/does-alcohol-help-you-sleep/&#34;&gt;most frequently used sleep aid&lt;/a&gt; - but it will prevent you from getting the deep sleep your body needs. Similarly, blood sugar can affect the depth of your sleep, so If you frequently find yourself waking up groggy, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/trouble-sleeping-some-bedtime-snacks-can-help-you-sleep#1&#34;&gt;try a tablespoon of peanut butter before bed to even out your glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides what you consume, your environment before, during, and after sleep is a major component of “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kelly.starrett.7/posts/560553770790345&#34;&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; When you pause for a second and think about deep evolutionary time, most of our ancestors probably didn’t stay up that late after the sun went down or sleep in that much after the sun came up. And they certainly weren’t staring at sunlight-mimicking screens until moments before closing their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, you want your sleeping place to be dark. Really dark. Like, underground with closed shutters dark. If you can’t swing that, &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Revolutionary-Patented-SLEEP-MASTER-Sleep/dp/B0015NZ6FK/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495647064&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=sleep+master+mask&#34;&gt;a good eye mask&lt;/a&gt; is a lot cheaper than blackout curtains and a lot more attractive than foil on the windows. And stay away from screens for at least an hour before bed, preferably entirely after dark - even if you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513&#34;&gt;Nightshift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://justgetflux.com/&#34;&gt;f.lux&lt;/a&gt;, or a pair of &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Uvex-Blocking-Computer-Glasses-SCT-Orange/dp/B000USRG90/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495647185&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=orange+safety+glasses&#34;&gt;dorky orange safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend. Once you wake up, you want to reset your body’s light-based regulation system by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.belsomra.com/static/pdf/light-early-in-the-day-boosts-sleep-at-night.pdf&#34;&gt;getting some sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, preferably a 15-30 minutes if you can swing it. I like to spend part of my morning routine sitting outside in the sun with my journal when the weather cooperates, but even on overcast days, standing by a window and looking outside will help. As an added stress-regulating bonus, sunlight exposure helps produce Vitamin E, which appears to &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/sun-happiness.htm&#34;&gt;help make you happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next big offender of the modern world is noise. Even if you are lucky enough to live way out in the country with neighbors miles off, there’s still probably computers whirring, spouses snoring, cats knocking things over, or whatever. While especially jarring in the middle of the night, noises like this most frequently are a problem by preventing you from getting to sleep, as they stop you from turning off your hyper-aware daytime brain. So, either get some &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Macks-Pillow-Silicone-Earplugs-Value/dp/B003LZQGN6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495647907&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=mack%27s%2Bsilicone%2Bear%2Bplugs&amp;amp;th=1&#34;&gt;good earplugs&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Marpac-Dohm-DS-Natural-Sound-Machine/dp/B00HD0ELFK/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=hpc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495647446&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;keywords=white%2Bnoise%2Bmachine&amp;amp;th=1&#34;&gt;white noise machine&lt;/a&gt;. Pro tip on the white noise machine: you can get 80% of the benefit from a cheap desktop oscillating fan, so if you have one lying around, it’s a great way to make sure white noise doesn’t bother you or anyone you share a bed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these approaches, you need to experiment and see what works for you. For example, I have found that if I wear orange safety glasses from sundown until bed time and then strap on a sleep mask all night, I wake up incredibly groggy - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melatonin-dosage-and-risks_us_56deff8ce4b03a40567a1e1e&#34;&gt;probably a melatonin overload&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the 90 minute guideline is just that - an average from observing lots of people. If you rigorously time your wake-up to be exactly 6 hours after you drift off, you might be off by 20 or 30 minutes if your cycle is just 5 or 6 minutes different from the average. A good rule of thumb is that if you could fall back asleep with zero effort 30 minutes after you got up with no coffee in your system, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/10/28/dont-cut-sleep/&#34;&gt;you didn’t get enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of sleep and exercise will get you 80% of the stress mitigation and dissipation benefits, but there are other important pieces of the puzzle, and the next biggest is eating well. Diet is even more complicated than exercise and sleep, so I’ll stick to a very brief overview. Whatever dietary choice you make to get healthier, it’s almost certainly going to involve &lt;a href=&#34;http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/welcome-to-the-war-on-insulin&#34;&gt;fewer simple carbohydrates than most Americans eat&lt;/a&gt;. While it seems true that &lt;a href=&#34;http://main.poliquingroup.com/articlesmultimedia/articles/article/1403/five_reasons_to_eat_carbs_at_night.aspx&#34;&gt;some carbs before bed can help getting to sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the long term health effects of non-stop starches are pretty horrifying. Options include Tim Ferriss’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/comment-page-10/&#34;&gt;Slow Carb diet&lt;/a&gt;, the widely known &lt;a href=&#34;http://thepaleodiet.com/&#34;&gt;Paleo diet&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/&#34;&gt;Ketogenic Diet&lt;/a&gt;. I have enjoyed and felt good on all of these options, but of the three, the easiest to start and stick with is definitely the Slow Carb diet. If you aren’t practiced at funky food restrictions, give it a try before you jump into Paleo, Keto, pure juicing or any other more strict diet. It’s easy to stick with even when you go out with your friends, it tastes good and is filling, and it’s easy to build muscle and lose weight while you’re doing all this exercise and sleeping well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for goodness’s sake - drink some water. Staying hydrated is one of the few things in life that makes everything else better and is as close to free and easy as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve talked about physical fixes, but there are several mental tools you can use. I’ve purposely left these approaches for last precisely because most people think of stress as “all in your head”, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/5/18/the-bathtub-model-of-stress-self-care-part-1&#34;&gt;as we saw previously&lt;/a&gt;, it is largely a physiological phenomenon and most of the best answers are likewise physical. That being said, your brain is part of your body, and a rather important part at that, so the ways you manage it affect everything else. I agree with &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2009/04/13/stoicism-101-a-practical-guide-for-entrepreneurs/?utm_campaign=Startup%2BWeekly&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=Startup_Weekly_15&#34;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanholiday.net/stoicism-a-practical-philosophy-you-can-actually-use/&#34;&gt;Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism&#34;&gt;Stoicism&lt;/a&gt; is the best “mental operating system upgrade” you can install for a chaotic and stressful world. Check out Holiday’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph-ebook/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495648679&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/a&gt; if you want a discussion of how to be a stoic in the modern world, or read Seneca’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Letters-Stoic-Epistulae-Morales-Lucilium-ebook/dp/B005NC0MGW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495648708&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=letters+from+a+stoic&#34;&gt;Letters from a Stoic&lt;/a&gt; for advice on how to be a stoic in the first century CE - turns out the way is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just a few years ago meditation was still considered pretty out there, but these days it’s extremely common, and just about everyone has heard something about it. What a lot of folks don’t realize is that there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://liveanddare.com/types-of-meditation&#34;&gt;a lot of different types of meditation&lt;/a&gt;, and that different types work better for different people. As with building any other habit, for meditation I recommend picking a stupidly easy microhabit that you do every day, and build from there - say, ten &lt;a href=&#34;http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/mindful_breathing&#34;&gt;mindful breaths&lt;/a&gt;. Many people find &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/mindfulness-meditation&#34;&gt;guided&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/&#34;&gt;meditations&lt;/a&gt; useful, and there are lots of options out there. You might even try the free trial of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app&#34;&gt;headspace app&lt;/a&gt; - which incorporates some nice features to support habit formation. The single best piece of advice I ever received for getting started in meditation is this: just remember that simply sitting still, breathing deeply, and taking a break from the press of life is good all by itself. You are winning just by spending the time. The point is the practice. You can worry about the finer points later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last mental tool is pretty new for me, but has already had a tremendously positive impact on my life - consciously feeling gratitude and wishing happiness for others. This part will likely sound the most “hippy dippy” to you, and the least in keeping with my usual hard nosed self improvement advice, but it is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier&#34;&gt;empirically backed&lt;/a&gt; and it works. To practice gratitude, simply make a habit each day of writing down three things you are grateful for. I use the prompts from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal&#34;&gt;Five Minute Journal&lt;/a&gt; in my own planner to remind me. Bonus points if you really make yourself feel the gratitude. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonyrobbins.com/&#34;&gt;Tony Robbins&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2016/09/18/how-to-resolve-internal-conflict/&#34;&gt;wonderful follow-along audio exercise&lt;/a&gt; for getting into this that takes about five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing happiness on others is even easier. This is an exercise I got from Chade-Meng Tan in &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495649543&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt;: pick two random people a day and think to yourself “I wish they will be happy.” Don’t say anything, don’t do anything, just think it. It’s remarkable how quickly this starts to turn things around and improve your mood, and you’ll find it hard to stick to just two people once you make a habit of it. The results are seriously out of all proportion you could expect from something so easy. I have found it to be doubly effective as an antidote to frustration while driving - right after I curse at someone for doing something frustrating on the road, I catch myself and hope for them to be happy. It reminds me simultaneously that whatever they did wasn’t that important, that they’re a human who deserves happiness, and that anger is unhelpful and corrosive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pick just one technique from each of the categories above and put them into practice for a month, I guarantee your life will be better - you will feel happier, more relaxed, and much less stressed. Keep them up long term and start adding in more and you will be healthier and mentally sharper. Even with these practices, though, stress will still intrude on your life and you’ll get to points where you need something to do now. So next time I’ll share some stress “first aid” techniques to cope with acute stress as you feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-05-19-the-bathtub-model-of-stress-self-care-part-1/ -&lt;p&gt;Stress is something that we all probably experience more often that we’d like and near constantly hear about in books, online, and on popular TV shows, but most of us have a pretty nebulous understanding of just what stress really is. So, today I want to introduce a more specific definition of stress than we usually use, talk about a useful model for thinking about it, break that model down its component parts, and then take a look at how that breakdown can help us more effectively manage and use stress in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, let’s get on the same page about what I mean by “stress” and why it’s not quite as bad as you may have heard. When I say “stress”, I am referring specifically to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)&#34;&gt;physiological stress&lt;/a&gt;, which is characterized by an elevated heart rate, increased cortisol levels, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system (the “fight of flight” response). These responses can be incredibly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/08/15/managing-stress-arousal-for-optimal-performance-a-guide-to-the-warrior-color-code/&#34;&gt;useful&lt;/a&gt; sometimes. When experiencing them, you may experience enhanced concentration to the point of &lt;a href=&#34;http://sirlingames.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/17/evolution-2008-results-and-stories.html&#34;&gt;apparent time dilation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/emcrit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/grossman-heart-rate.jpg&#34;&gt;improved reflexes&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&#34;http://abcnews.go.com/US/superhero-woman-lifts-car-off-dad/story?id=16907591&#34;&gt;unexpected displays of strength&lt;/a&gt;. Even the health problems we associate with stress appear to be determined by how we &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend&#34;&gt;think about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend&#34;&gt; the stress in our lives&lt;/a&gt;. But what does this have to do with feeling overwhelmed because you have a million items in your inbox? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we didn’t evolve with inboxes, and our bodies still haven’t quite gotten the memo that the modern world is a bit different. We respond to anything unpleasant or a threatening or discomforting the same way we would respond to a clear and present physical danger - by prepping our bodies to either run away or beat something to death. This effect is exacerbated when money is on the line, because in the modern world, money = how we buy food and shelter. It’s not that long a chain for your monkey brain to evaluate threats to your work as threats to your life. So we respond to our boss yelling at us, the threat of not landing a deal, or pushing ourselves to meet that deadline the same way we would if we got into our car and found we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYIKdQcqbjI&#34;&gt;a cougar for a co-pilot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given this physiological understanding of stress and why it’s relevant even to the most sheltered of office workers, I want to introduce a useful model for thinking about stress that I first encountered when I was preparing to join the Army in &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Combat-Psychology-Physiology-Deadly-Conflict-ebook/dp/B072HHSZNN/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;me=&#34;&gt;On Combat&lt;/a&gt; by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://tipyomi-sender.appspot.com/showtip/Sheepdog%20Tip%20of%20the%20Day/Before%20Combat/100&#34;&gt;the bathtub model&lt;/a&gt;.” I like this model because it is simple and easy to visualize, but still captures a lot of nuance about how we experience stress in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s great about this model is that it lets us isolate and manipulate three separate variables when approaching how to think of and deal with stress. “Stress” is usually this big, scary blob of a concept that feels omnipresent and unfightable. When I hear “reduce stress” and my response is “what the hell does that actually mean?” Should I quit my job and face not knowing where my next meal is coming from? Or maybe I should stop caring about improving myself and the things that excite me. Hell, maybe I should just hide in my house and never come out - after all, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Otla5157c&#34;&gt;there’s another way to interpret YOLO&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly I don’t think any of those are great answers. Fortunately, the bathtub model lets us come up with better ones by considering the three essential pieces of a bathtub: faucet, drain, and tub. Let’s step through each one and what it means in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first piece, the faucet represents the sources of stress in your life - people yelling at you, worries about money, saber tooth tigers trying to eat you, et cetera. This is probably the most obvious part of the model, and the one that comes to mind when you think “stress.” We tend to look at it as some external force irradiating us as we go about our business. One nice thing about the faucet metaphor is that it suggests a useful application: you can adjust how open or closed a faucet is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do that by introducing or removing stressors from your life. Most of us come to accept the majority of stressors in our life as givens, but really we choose to accept them. Even for unexpected events totally outside of our control, we can at least change &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495143311&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=man%27s+search+for+meaning&#34;&gt;how we view and interpret them&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the truly external forces in our life, there are tons of things within our control - interacting with people that drain us, engaging in activities with no useful outcome, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://daily.barbellshrugged.com/my-top-self-care-moves/&#34;&gt;consistently maintaining poor posture&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to turn down the firehose of stress filling up and overflowing your tub is one of the most straightforward and impactful ways to see immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, we all end up with some stress coming into our lives - even if you retire to pristine alpine monastery, something is going to stress you out eventually. Which means we need something to actively relieve stress - the drain for your tub.  Some good examples are working out, getting a massage, or meditating. Some not so good examples are drinking, yelling at your kids, or doing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial thing to recognize here is that like the faucet, you can change the size of your drain. Sure, having a nice, cold drink at the end of a really trying day will relieve some stress immediately, but jogging consistently every day will make it harder for you to even get to that point. Getting enough sleep, eating well, and maintaining healthy, loving relationships are also fantastic examples of how to increase the size of your drain. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-the-luckiest-guy-on-the-planet-in-4-easy-steps/&#34;&gt;James Altucher’s daily practice&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty great starting place if you’re looking for maintenance activities that will keep your drain flowing clog-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the source of the name of the model: the tub itself. This is the least obvious and most important part of the model. When you hear about the negative side effects of stress, what you’re really hearing about is the tub overflowing. You see, the tub is your capacity to function effectively under stress. And guess what: like the other two pieces of the model, this is not a fixed amount, but rather one that you can adjust through training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single biggest thing you can do to increase your tolerance for stress is to exercise regularly. I know you keep hearing this, but in our sedentary society we need to hear it early and often: exercise makes everything better, and stress is no exception. Why do you think the most elite military units also work out the hardest? Do you think it’s so they can punch terrorists to death or secure allies via arm wrestling contests? No, it’s mostly to improve their capacity to endure physiological stress. &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Soldiers-Load-Mobility-Nation-Marshall/dp/B00FXA04YO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1495144949&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=soldier%27s+load+and+mobility+of+a+nation%5D&#34;&gt;Exhausted people and terrified people are psychologically and physiologically damn near identical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, most of what will increase your bathtub size - exercise, good sleep, breathing exercises, and meditation -  is similar to what will help you drain stress, but they operate by slightly different mechanisms, and their results are different. When you exercise, you release all kinds of great hormones, and when you relax afterwards, you bleed off those that contribute to physiological stress, like cortisol. Regular and intensive physical training, though, actually allows you to perform &lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/emcrit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/grossman-unified-model-stress-performance.jpg&#34;&gt;normally (or even better) at elevated levels of physiological stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Navy SEAL that kicks down a door and shoots a terrorist in the face doesn’t have a calm heart rate or low levels of cortisol - he probably actually has higher of both than a normal person could endure without passing out, because he has trained his body to accept and make use of that state. He has a multi-person jacuzzi where most of us have a foot basin. While I don’t expect most of you to be engaged in that variety of high-performance activity, more effectively inoculating yourself against stress will allow you to get better results any time stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the bathtub model has let us break down the big, scary topic of “stress” into manageable variables that we can tweak in our life. By having different pieces to attack, we can mitigate one area we can’t change right now by focusing on another that we can. I’m going to talk soon in more detail about some of the things I have found helpful in my own life for adjusting those variables, but I’d love to hear what you do to effectively deal with stress in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Super” Combinations from Tools of Titans</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-05-12-super-combinations-from-tools-of-titans/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-05-12-super-combinations-from-tools-of-titans/ -&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1494546414&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt; here, but today I want to share my favorite trick for using the book. While every “tool&amp;rdquo; in the book is useful individually, I believe some of the material is even more useful when synthesized into a coherent whole. Below, I’m going to share the one that’s been on my mind the most recently, with a concrete example of the super tool in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools of Titans works as a “choose your own adventure” book, with almost every chapter dedicated to one of the top performers interviewed by Ferriss on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/podcast/&#34;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few original chapters by him, many of which are cleaned up versions of previous &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. All of the material is fantastic and focuses on actionable recommendations you can immediately incorporate into your life, but it can be a bit scattered. If you don’t know which person talks about which techniques, you might be at a bit of a loss. Fortunately, shortly after it came out, they released an index - if you get the eBook, it’s in there, but if you have a physical copy you’ll need the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2017/01/25/tools-of-titans-index/&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, the book is uniquely suited to flipping through and browsing around for whatever catches your interest - a procedure that I find easier and more pleasant in the print copy. The one concession to topical organization the book makes is to divide it into three sections: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/early-to-bed-and-early-to-rise.html&#34;&gt;Health, Wealthy, and Wise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that ToT is a smorgasbord of fantastic information, but it’s up to you to assemble your own meal. At first, I was a bit disappointed by this approach, as I craved more synthesis. Eventually, though, I realized that the kind of synthesis I wanted had to be highly personalized. So I started doing my own. As I proceeded, I noticed that some combinations were especially - dare I say it? - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRuNxHqwazs&#34;&gt;synergistic&lt;/a&gt;. These tools come together &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZv5Z2Iz_s&#34;&gt;Voltron-style&lt;/a&gt; and form what I like to call “super tools”. Some of these are going to be highly personalized - like the combination of diet and exercise that works best for you - but others have pretty broad applicability and I’ve been able to incorporate some of them into my coaching practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my favorite of these shareable super tools is the combination of “Systems Not Goals”, “No Lose Planning”, and “Maximizing Options”. The first comes from the chapter on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.dilbert.com/?utm_source=dilbert.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=site&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-engagement&amp;amp;utm_content=navigation&#34;&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt; and is summarized in an entertaining &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/Scottadams925/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-overrated/&#34;&gt;slide show&lt;/a&gt;, fleshed out in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964992706/goals-vs-systems&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and greatly detailed in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1376677690&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;recent book&lt;/a&gt;. The basic idea is that instead of focusing on fixed, pre-determined goals as most self-improvement literature recommends, you instead build systems that force you to develop in the ways you want to. Blogging is a great example given by Adams - he wasn’t doing it for a specific outcome, but he knew it would a) help him practice writing, b) give him an opportunity to test reactions to different styles and voices, and c) help him build his audience. This led to articles in major publications, which led to published books, which led to ridiculously lucrative speaking gigs - none of which was precisely what he had in mind, but all of which was enabled by following the system of blogging regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhao6LPShQ&#34;&gt;Zord in our giant robot&lt;/a&gt; of kicking ass is “No Lose Planning”. This is a concept that Ferriss himself &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2016/04/11/tim-ferriss-podcast-business/&#34;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; and explicitly links with the systems approach advocated by Adams, but I think it’s useful to tease out as a separate component. Any time you start a new project, take a look at it through a frame of “what will I get out of this even if it seemingly fails?” In particular, focus on what skills you’ll learn and what relationships you’ll build. The example he works through is podcasting: he knew that it would allow him to get over verbal tics like “ums” and “ahs”, it would let him practice interviewing people (essential to his writing career), and it would give him an excuse to reach out to ridiculously talented people like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.schwarzenegger.com/&#34;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mcchrystalgroup.com/&#34;&gt;General Stanley McChrystal&lt;/a&gt;. So even if not one person ever listened to his podcast, it’d still be a win in his life. When you do it right, any new project you undertake develops skills and relationships that will be worthwhile no matter the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://timfall.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/mixing-metaphors.jpg&#34;&gt;mixed metaphor&lt;/a&gt; puzzle is to “Maximize Options”, and this one comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/&#34;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt;. His website is chock full of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/book&#34;&gt;awesome stuff&lt;/a&gt;, by the way, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/&#34;&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2015/12/28/derek-sivers-reloaded-on-success-habits-and-billionaires-with-perfect-abs/&#34;&gt;episodes&lt;/a&gt; of the Tim Ferriss Show are some of my favorites. At any rate, he talks about the idea that a good rule of thumb when deciding between multiple possible pursuits is to choose the path that creates the most options. I had encountered this concept previously in a discussion on &lt;a href=&#34;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4699&#34;&gt;strategy games&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&#34;&gt;Eric S Raymond&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/&#34;&gt;Nassim Taleb&lt;/a&gt; also talks about this idea in &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto-ebook/dp/B0083DJWGO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1494548661&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=antifragile&#34;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;, where he emphasizes the importance of optionality in situations where there is an uncapped upside. The main reason you want to pursue this approach is that the future is uncertain, and you can’t know what will be the best way to react to changing circumstances ahead of time. That means that the more leeway you have in choosing how to react, the more likely you are to have a good choice available. Think of the old proverb about “if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Now imagine instead a fully stocked toolkit - suddenly your ability to solve problems well is hugely increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does it look like when you put all of these together? Simply put, when deciding on projects to pursue, you select systems that maximize options and have guaranteed benefits in terms of skills or relationships built. Let’s get more concrete: for some of my clients working on improving their career I have recommended improving their social and professional network. First, this recommendation involves a system for improving connections with people, rather than a specific goal - things like building a habit of having lunch with people, identifying people in your network that can have the biggest impact, and so forth. Next, the project is framed in no fail terms - even if they don’t find a new job or land Bill Gates as a mentor, they still will have better relationships and interpersonal habits. Finally, building a good network maximizes your options - the people you get to know and become close to can help you find a job, give you advice, be customers for your business, or hell, even become your new best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this example has given you a taste of what I mean by “super tools”. I’m always on the lookout for new and different combinations that will be especially valuable - both to help my clients and for my own personal improvement. Right now I’m especially keen on figuring out the best combination of diet and exercise from the Healthy section for my own personal use. Have you read the book? Do you have any combinations that you find especially productive? I’d love to hear about them. In any case, I’ll keep sharing as I put more together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools of Titans works amazingly well as a buffet of great options, but it is even better when you create a masterpiece of a meal out of the available ingredients. Some may only work for you personally, others may be widely useful to a variety of people. By all means, if you have any of the shareable variety, let us know so we can start taking advantage of them too! In the meantime, I hope that you put the combination of Systems, Not Goals,  No Lose Planning, and  Maximizing Options to some good use starting today!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-27-the-lazy-mans-guide-to-exercise/ -&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure you’re sick of hearing, exercise is the single best thing you can do to make every other area of your life better and easier. We all know this, but damn if getting started doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck. Especially if you didn’t take to exercise early in life, it’s hard to motivate yourself to endure such unpleasantness. You end up with the same vague feeling of guilt you feel when you realize you haven’t flossed since right after your last dentist appointment. Fortunately, there are reliable ways to make it easier to get started and to practice in a way that sticks, and I’m going to share some of those techniques today - from one lazy bum to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1493327437289-HIRYFJZYMSWBQXROPELT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kB7jRAXYnud1GpUQmNttyhJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFT9fKV5OBz3MYceo3y5RVgjOOxuiKzLoeSJGRqF5pxSYk6F1R1CriF8Yes9BWbW6c/Alternate+Skinny+Jeff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Does this look like someone who works out to you?&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this look like someone who works out to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people just seem to “get&amp;rdquo; exercise and enjoy it with zero effort. Maybe you’re one of them - if so, there’s not much here for you - go for a nice jog or put someone in a triangle choke while the rest of us hash this out. Still with me? Okay, so you know how it is. Check out that skinny nerd above - that’s me. For years I was lazy - as a kid little league was boring, in high school I barely took enough PE to graduate, and in college the most strenuous thing I did was the occasional racquetball game. So what? I wasn’t fat, I was young and full of energy and more interested in reading stuff than “being outside.” Any of this sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1493327502146-NJXE7MVQ2DJ85YPRE48M/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCjAVTnxV7Zc3q25r02TGhhZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEKRFIcgH6JZXmMmFiJ-qn4R08S60Jw4LG_0GwAMX6I0O4sk1tdgEkQsVzLuuaVaBo/Basic+Training+Running.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;That&amp;rsquo;s me on the right, thoroughly enjoying a run, obviously&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s me on the right, thoroughly enjoying a run, obviously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, somewhere along the way of reading about hardass &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Gates-Fire-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B000NJL7QO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493227655&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=gates+of+fire&#34;&gt;Spartans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Modern-Library-ebook/dp/B000FC1JAI/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493227708&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=meditations+marcus+aurelius&#34;&gt;Stoics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein-ebook/dp/B004EYTK2C/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&#34;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Moon-Harsh-Mistress-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0312863551/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493227741&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=heinlein&#34;&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elise.com/quotes/heinlein_-_specialization_is_for_insects&#34;&gt;Robert Heinlein&lt;/a&gt;, it finally sunk in that I was missing out on being a complete human being, and that fitness was necessary for true &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete_(moral_virtue)&#34;&gt;excellence&lt;/a&gt;. So I start working out a little bit - doing some pushups in my room, laps in the pool, that kind of thing, but pretty sporadically. Then a good friend of mine helps give me the crazy idea to join the Army. Being a good nerd, I found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Ultimate-Basic-Training-Guidebook-Surviving-ebook/dp/B004HW6AGK/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493227986&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=survival+guide+basic+training&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on how to prepare for Basic Training, and guess what the top recommendation was? Get in shape before you get there. So I did, and sure enough, Basic was a lot easier than I expected, the expression on my face in the above photo notwithstanding. I mean, sure, there were still hours-long sessions of doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk7yXdzabxY&#34;&gt;ski jumpers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3Gl-nC7IQ&#34;&gt;mountain climbers&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQwNN-0AgWc&#34;&gt;Bee Gees&lt;/a&gt;, but for the first time in my life I was in pretty good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1493327549961-OVNLRV8I0F3AF6PSM2AE/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPZjswWEEM1xUlE2nw_1gDZZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFEypcWtVdAnmHnO4a1hPNGKftICS8WvBaaDvL8dARr2lYCOBSuh7_iz0ZUXSA5sds/Buff+Jeff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Look at that, muscles!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at that, muscles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed that way throughout my five years in the Army, and you know what I discovered that was slightly shocking? It felt great being in shape. Not just the obvious stuff, like picking up heavy stuff with ease or getting checked out when I wore a sweater - don’t get me wrong, those were great. Even more so than that, I felt a sort of ease and confidence all the time. I knew that whatever came up, I could handle it, physical, mental, whatever. Not to mention I could get away with eating garbage and drinking beer and not sleeping nearly enough and still feel fine. Over those five years, I totally shifted my identity from a bookish nerd to a fit guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with static self-identity, though, is that it can get out of date if you’re not careful. When I got out of the Army, I discovered an ugly truth: the group dynamics and the yelling and the threat of punishment all had more to do with me staying fit than I would have liked to admit. Now without a platoon sergeant and 6:30 Physical Training formation, I kept some things the same. I kept eating garbage. I kept drinking beer. But other stuff I changed. I stopped running. I stopped &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goruck.com/how-to-ruck&#34;&gt;ruck marching&lt;/a&gt;. I stopped doing any exercise. No prizes if you guess happened: I got fat. Not morbidly obese or anything, but my pants didn’t fit any more, and I was  staring in the mirror going “what the hell happened? I&amp;rsquo;m a fit guy. I thought I was invincible.” Turns out I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtBc5ABgYEM&#34;&gt;vincible&lt;/a&gt;. Like we all are. So I had to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1493327619307-ARXOSE5LEYU1HRYUXXA4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMaDaKi2epkHuSAS8ZI0rbpZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVExRf72fONj3xACAiDmTquLvbdrmxSnqZEb9JSyoV0DlcY7l6Ms67beKNYVsWU6vCc/Sad%2C+Fat+Jeff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;This is my &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; picture I took when I got serious about getting back in shape. And the last picture of me shirtless, I promise.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; picture I took when I got serious about getting back in shape. And the last picture of me shirtless, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve succeeded in overcoming that and making exercise a priority every single day, and I want to share what works for me. To make it work for you, you may have to tweak some stuff - for example, many people benefit from having a workout buddy or scheduled classes on the calendar. However you make it work, the three principles below will be the foundation that makes it easy to start and easy to sustain: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems, Not Goals - I discovered this &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964992706/goals-vs-systems&#34;&gt;maxim&lt;/a&gt; of Scott Adams’s via &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493229267&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt;, and it is pure gold. Forget about fixating on a target weight. You want to focus on the process, and turn it into something automatic that never goes away. Goals can be great for reminding yourself why you’re doing something when you don’t feel like it, or for getting you motivated in the beginning, but in the long haul, you want to systematize your behavior. That means having a set routine or approach that you follow. In my case that currently means doing one workout every morning from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/&#34;&gt;Gymnastic Bodies&lt;/a&gt; - which I track that in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/14/get-outta-my-head-and-into-my-&#34;&gt;task capture sys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/14/get-outta-my-head-and-into-my-&#34;&gt;tem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micro-habits - The key to building your system is ridiculously easy regular behaviors. For that you want to take advantage of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jamesclear.com/small-habits&#34;&gt;micro-habits&lt;/a&gt;. These are habits so tiny that you can’t possibly find a way to rationalize not doing them. A classic example is to commit to yourself to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-change-a-habit-video/&#34;&gt;flossing just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-change-a-habit-video/&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-change-a-habit-video/&#34;&gt; tooth&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds preposterous, but the science &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-13226-1_13&#34;&gt;backs it up&lt;/a&gt;. Micro-habits serve two key functions: they keep you consistent (see below), and they help you overcome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH5B2j843WU&#34;&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;. When you don’t feel like working out, if you can tell yourself that you only have to do this super easy micro-habit, then you get started, and next thing you know, inertia pulls you into doing the rest of your workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something every single day - Micro-habits help your consistency not just by getting you to workout when you don’t want to, they also give you a way to keep your habit going even when something really does gotta give. Picture a cave man hunched against a blizzard, marching with his tribe cradling a tiny, tiny spark and occasionally blowing on it to keep it going, the seed of the fire that will keep them all alive when they reach shelter. Your micro-habit is keeping that spark going. I think the very best way to keep your habit alive is to do &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2017/03/16/jerzy-gregorek/&#34;&gt;a little bit of something every day&lt;/a&gt;. I was skeptical for a long time, having had some success with working out two or three times a week, but I eventually lost those habits - now I’ve done at least a micro-habit every single day for over a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough theorizing, right? We’re talking about exercise here, so let’s get hands-on and practical! If you don’t already have some ideas of your own, here is my specific recommendation for the absolute novice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to a system of doing some exercise everyday, no matter how small - exercise can be as simple as walking and stretching, btw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it a part of your morning or evening routine, whichever you are doing consistently. If you don’t have either, go with the morning, so there’s less chance you decide to skip it later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a single exercise that you know you can do right now that is too easy to skip - maybe a single push up or squat, maybe touching your toes, maybe walking around for two minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of whether you do or don’t do this somehow (if you have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/14/get-outta-my-head-and-into-my-&#34;&gt;task capture system&lt;/a&gt; going, use that, or you could just use the Seinfeld &lt;a href=&#34;http://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy&#34;&gt;“Don’t Break the Chain” Method&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel motivated and excited to do more, go right ahead! But remember, you still win if you only do your micro-habit - everything else is special bonus exercise. Does this sound like it will never do any good? Perhaps. But we’re working gradually here - I’m not recommending you only do one push up a day for the rest of your life. The goal of this is not to make you a bodybuilding champion. The goal is to help you see yourself as someone who works out every day. This kind of identity shift is super &lt;a href=&#34;http://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits&#34;&gt;useful for habit formation&lt;/a&gt;. Down the road, once this is automatic, we can talk about how to build on it. Just remind yourself that even ten seconds of exercise is better than no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1493327667053-R7NH7I5PJ9PAJOU2SKM1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPZjswWEEM1xUlE2nw_1gDZZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFEypcWtVdAnmHnO4a1hPNGKftICS8WvBaaDvL8dARr2lYCOBSuh7_iz0ZUXSA5sds/image-asset.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Here I am today, looking good and feeling good&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am today, looking good and feeling good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with exercise definitely sucks, I know. Even though I like how I feel when I work out regularly, there are days where I catch myself thinking “do I really have to?” But then my micro-habit steps in to the rescue. A system like this is really just the beginning. Once you start finding it easy to exercise and notice how good you feel, you can expand your daily exercise and get more ambitious (keeping that micro-habit in your back pocket!). Hell, you may even find something physical that you truly enjoy, like bike riding or martial arts. Then you’ll start sneaking in even more exercise and not notice. One day you’ll wake up and realize you’re not actually that lazy anymore - and that’s a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-21-float-on-my-first-experience-with-a-flotation-tank/ -&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about something a little different - my first experience with a float tank session. Also known as flotation tanks or sensory deprivation tanks, I first &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=64ff13e88f&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;heard about them via Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt;, and he discusses them in his latest book &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=254b9de57e&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt;, but apparently Joe Rogan is also &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=f1a193875c&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;a huge proponent of them&lt;/a&gt;, and has some great stuff to say about using them in a regular practice. I’m going to go through some of the benefits attributed to float sessions, talk about my own experience, where things fell a touch short, and things I plan on doing differently next time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, why would you want to float around naked in the dark for an hour? There are a number of studies on the benefits, many of them focusing on therapeutic applications, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=949fe54860&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;treating addiction, insomnia, and depression&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning shortly after their invention back in the 1950’s, they have also been studied &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=573a51abb0&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;in connection with creativity and concentration&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have shown &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=293469ed2a&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;an improvement in “mindful presence”&lt;/a&gt; versus a control group, along with many of the associated benefits usually linked with a regular meditation practice. Some folks report having major emotional breakthroughs, spiritual insights, or even &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=3ead042f09&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;psychedelic experiences&lt;/a&gt; including feelings of transcendence and hallucinations, though these seem to be less common and are not very likely outside of very long sessions. Just about everyone agrees that at a minimum they are &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=2ccf100cc7&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;deeply relaxing&lt;/a&gt; and positively affect stress by reducing cortisol levels and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1492807889449-NVJ936F05GDDKQ6F23GA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLBXYxPb51fd_w-qJv5zy4t7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0prfa1Z6IeUrCPboCAmmHZnxLA1LmtQWLdQZ0EFuAlmmrheQ_YgjG5FLADfkTWtzfw/SCFC%2BFront%2BDesk.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;SCFC+Front+Desk.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went into my session with some pretty high hopes. Turns out I thoroughly enjoyed my session and the time afterwards! It was extremely relaxing, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=aad59a3333&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;Space City Float&lt;/a&gt; did an amazing job of creating a peaceful ambience and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1492807987983-GZJJ23031VIY3YPWJUGH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKu7wfkKCGSXycJlFNmeSER7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYsUTjZSl38MHFC61Z4vVekjLE3R5euVlU0coA5eoL7_Ql-ZUrVfrc-q7qzhmWj5iw/image-asset.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I was shown to the changing room, furnished with slippers and a nice, soft robe. With my stuff stowed in the locker, I went to the “Space Room”, where I was seated in a massage chair. As the chair reclined and started whirring and pushing, I had a few visions of Final Destination gruesomeness, but I quickly settled into it and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588fac99f5e231608e25ebd0/1492808050729-P1Y8DULQ3L5MH241P17Y/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNKU_v8gJAcxDrmB-soKvj1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVH7wdpQi_gwH_-rfgB8xc3aCDYU5QsKfHvKofLxtwAwA5XleA9PsoOHujT9UMkA80c/image-asset.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room is named for the projected “stars” on the ceiling - green pinpoint lights that move slowly and a blue nebula-looking shape. I watched that for awhile but eventually closed my eyes and enjoyed the massage. From there I was led to the actual float room, and based on some of the photos I had seen, I was a bit surprised by the size of the tank. The attendant was very helpful, explained what to expect and gave me a few specific tips on how to proceed. Then he stepped out to let me shower and get into the tank. I had been worried I wouldn’t float, given my poor track record floating in pools and even the ocean, but they put a hell of a lot of epsom salt in the water, and I couldn’t have sunk on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the flotation session itself, I was a bit unsure how to proceed - should I meditate? Just lay there, let my mind wander, and see what happens? Open eyes or closed? Following the attendant’s advice, I counted down from 100 in time with my breaths, a meditation tank I was familiar with. After the countdown, I mostly focused on my breathing, trying to be mindful, but my mind definitely wandered a bit and I might have drifted off to sleep somewhere there in the middle. Other than some sparkly blues and greens near the beginning, I didn’t really see anything whether my eyes were open or closed. Towards the end, my neck was a little sore, but nothing too distracting. At the end of the hour, a light came on in the tank and some soft music played, and I got out, showered again, and headed to the tea lounge, where some pleasant mint green tea was waiting and some relaxing “spiritual” music was playing. I chuckled a bit at the reading selection, featuring a fairly typical “spiritual” mixture of Christian, Buddhist, and new age books, but hey, nothing wrong there, it’s just not my speed. Instead, I opted to read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=1eb2625afd&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;Völuspá&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=a232ef2a97&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;from the Poetic Edda&lt;/a&gt; that I had brought myself and enjoyed both my tea and the residual feeling of relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I really noticed an effect, though, was afterwards. I headed to a coffee shop to get some work done, and I found myself feeling very “still” for lack of a better word. It wasn’t much more profound than I have experienced after a good meditation session, but it definitely lasted longer, and now a week later, I’m still feeling little flashes of the same feeling. Some of the harsher music that I normally enjoy, like heavy metal, was jarring and felt like stimulus overload. Other, softer music was more emotionally affecting, as was poetry, and I had a noticeable tendency to stare off into space and not think about anything in particular. It was easier to concentrate and feel mindful about activities like writing or drawing dividing lines in my journal. If you’ve ever done the exercises from &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=11992a5994&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&lt;/a&gt;, it felt a bit like the “R-Mode” they help you achieve. Plus, my coffee tasted especially good - but that might have just been the brew. While perhaps not as profound or life-altering as I might have secretly hoped, there was a definite effect and I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was overall a very positive experience, and I’m definitely going to do it again, I had a few minor nits to pick. First off, as I said, during the float, I did not experience any particularly profound or novel psychological states, and certainly nothing approaching the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=6f5f5ddc78&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;psychedelic experiences reported by some&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the mood-setting at Space City Float was a bit New Agey for my personal tastes, but only a touch. As I mentioned above, I declined to use the provided neck pillow and experienced some discomfort midway to late in the float. I also was sleepy and probably took a short nap. There were occasional mechanical noises from the tank that detracted from the total sensory deprivation intended. Finally, I haven’t yet noticed any insights or boosts in creativity that I can attribute to the tank session. Altogether, these are minor quibbles, and all can be mitigated or addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time I do this, I’m going to learn from my first experience and do a few things differently. First off, I’m going to make sure I’m well rested for the few days before my session - I was sleepy due to little sleep in this case. That way when I’m seeking deep psychological breakthroughs and the mysteries of the universe I’ll avoid a needed but unwelcome nap. I’ll also use the neck pillow to eliminate distracting discomfort. While floating, I will also more deliberately meditate, using techniques I have practiced in other settings. More structurally, I would like to integrate the session into a deliberate creative process of some kind. After my session, I had the feeling that I could have very effectively engaged in a creative activity, but instead I mostly focused on habitual tasks before taking a call. I am inspired to combine some of the method of James Fadiman’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=f01968642d&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; described in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=2b44f21683&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;episode of the Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/a&gt; and that of James Webb Young in &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=f182278fa5&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;A Technique for Producing Ideas&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, I want to select a creative project, work on it intensively to the point of mental exhaustion for the day or two before the session, put it completely out of my mind for the session, and then revisit it while feeling the immediate after effects. Perhaps its a cockamamie idea, but I want to give it a go. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Floating was definitely an interesting experience that I can’t wait to try again. Unless something goes seriously wrong the next time, I plan to make it a somewhat regular practice. I believe it already has and will continue to have a profound impact not only on my fulfillment thanks to the relaxation and clarity, but also on achievement due to its positive impact on creativity and concentration. If you’re interested in giving it a try, here’s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=ec03c178b2&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&amp;amp;id=d206b4b077&amp;amp;e=a21731beeb&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; for finding a float center for you - alternatively, just Google “[Your City] Float Tank” or “[Your City] Flotation”. If you’ve ever tried floating, let me know how it went for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-14-get-outta-my-head-and-into-my-/ -&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNgcYGgtf8M&#34;&gt;Billy Ocean&lt;/a&gt; a bit, today’s post is all about getting material out of your head and into your task capture system (not as catchy, I know). Writing down what you need to do is the most fundamental building block in a comprehensive &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/10/designing-your-own-productivity-framework&#34;&gt;productivity framework&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a seemingly simple tool, but it really is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&#34;&gt;80/20&lt;/a&gt; tool in the framework. Simply keeping everything you need to do in one place that you check regularly will do more for your productivity and peace of mind than any other single behavior change. So let’s take a few minutes to step through why your head is a garbage place to store tasks, the importance of making your system comprehensive, how to trust that system, and finally, what are some of the tools you can choose from to make sure you find one that fits your needs and your life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as we’ve talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/10/designing-your-own-productivity-framework&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I like to follow &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/&#34;&gt;David Allen’s&lt;/a&gt; example in defining task capture as getting things out of your head and into a system you trust. You don’t want to keep your tasks in your head if you can avoid it for a few reasons. First off, if you store your to do’s in your head, they will pop up like eager puppies trying to lick your face and distract you from concentrating. This situation will totally destroy your focus - even a clear mind is still pretty full of “&lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2016/07/24/how-to-cage-the-monkey-mind/&#34;&gt;Monkey Mind&lt;/a&gt;” thoughts, but one full of to do’s might as well be the primate house at the zoo. Secondly, when you are relying on memory for tasks, it is much harder to intentionally prioritize what you should do and much easier to do whatever you happen to remember. Acting on whatever happens to come into your head leads to more reactivity and less purposeful action towards strategic goals. Finally, the unfortunate truth is that even the best memories are spotty. It’s really easy to “lose” stuff, even important stuff. To really solidify something, our memories require all kinds of context and reinforcement, which most of just don’t do with transient to do’s. Sure, you could mitigate this by improving your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mind-performance-hacks/0596101538/ch01s07.html&#34;&gt;memory techniques&lt;/a&gt;, and such techniques have all kinds of great benefits, but I personally feel like the amount of effort required to master them is better put into memorizing things of more lasting value, so for tasks, I have outsourced the hard work of remembering to pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply writing tasks down won’t totally do the job of getting them out of your head, though, you have to put them into a system that is comprehensive. Basically, this means that you need a home for everything you need to keep track of or worry about. Not everything has to go in the same place, and you will likely have a few components to your system, but to paraphrase Einstein, a good task capture system should be “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein&#34;&gt;as simple as possible, but no simpler.&lt;/a&gt;” At a minimum, you will likely want a calendar and a task list. Now, different people take different approaches here, and as we’ll discuss in a moment, an essential component to trusting your system is that it works for you and your own weird brain. As an example of some different approaches, you might take a &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/15/fixed-schedule-productivity-how-i-accomplish-a-large-amount-of-work-in-a-small-number-of-work-hours/&#34;&gt;fixed schedule&lt;/a&gt; approach as Cal Newport Recommends, or you might take a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/learnonsteroids/SJCI93jfks9ijuquougjksnd908b89djijDr2-Feb/WeeklyDailyGoals.pdf&#34;&gt;Weekly/Daily Goals&lt;/a&gt; approach like Scott Young recommends. One approach I would encourage you not to take is keeping everything in your calendar, for reasons that are again &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/2009/08/when-to-block-your-calendar/&#34;&gt;best explained by David Allen&lt;/a&gt;. Your calendar should be your map of the day, showing the fixed terrain you have to navigate around. The more you introduce optional stuff that isn’t actually fixed, or that you can do at any time, the less trust you will have in the parts that are fixed. In other words, if you get used to ignoring or moving self-determined tasks on your calendar, you’ll erode how seriously you take appointments that are actual obligations to other people - which is bad news. Besides a calendar, you’ll want one or more ways of keeping track of tasks - some folks like to maintain a sharp separation of work and personal tasks, others like to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/09/david-allen-on-why-sorting-your-lists-by-contexts-even-matters/&#34;&gt;sort their tasks by context&lt;/a&gt;, and others like to have one unified place for everything. I fall into that last camp, and I use my &lt;a href=&#34;http://bulletjournal.com/&#34;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; for all tasks, both personal and work. Some folks supplement other tools with an @ACTION folder in their email client, where they keep any emails that require an action until they complete it. Personally, I have found the benefits of reducing the number of tools in my task capture system outweigh the benefits of convenience in processing emails. Your mileage may vary, and experimentation is the best way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing down all of your tasks comprehensively won’t do you any good if you don&amp;rsquo;t trust your system. Today, I want to stress the importance of habit building when it comes to learning to trust your task capture tools. You have to train yourself to turn to your task capture system anytime you ask yourself “what should I be doing right now?” This is all pretty abstract, so let me give you a concrete example of what I mean by a system that you trust. You get to the office and you know you have some meetings today, but you can’t quite remember which ones or when they are, so you pull up your calendar. You see what you have to do, reorient yourself to the day, and trust your reminders to let you know when you need to pack up and head to the conference room. That’s a system you trust. Building up that kind of trust takes some time, but it will go much faster if you choose a system that you enjoy and find convenient. As I’ve said before, I’m all about making it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/11/jeffs-recommended-self-improvement-reading&#34;&gt;easier to do the right thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s such an easy step to choose task capture tools that you find pleasant and satisfying. What do I mean by satisfying and pleasant? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wunderlist.com/&#34;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; has a nice little “ding!” that sounds when you check off a task that fades from the screen. I use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Hardcover-Notebook-Dotted/dp/B018R4I7A0/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492185336&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;keywords=leuchtturm+army+green&#34;&gt;hefty Leuchtturm 1917 notebook&lt;/a&gt; (in Army Green, naturally) with a lovely &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saddlebackleather.com/leather-notebook-cover&#34;&gt;Saddleback Leather cover&lt;/a&gt;. I also write with &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Lamy-CP1-Matte-Black-Fountain/dp/B0030MUMH6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492185445&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=lamy+cp1&#34;&gt;fancy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal/dp/B0002T401Y/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492185477&amp;amp;sr=8-8&amp;amp;keywords=lamy+safari+extra+fine&#34;&gt;fountain pens&lt;/a&gt;. One friend of mine uses checklists in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.onenote.com/&#34;&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt;, because he likes to be able to organize and search the stuff he’s done in the past. The specifics are not important, as everyone has slightly different tastes in convenience and aesthetics - what is important is that you like your tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tools, I’ve alluded to a few above, but there is really an embarrassment of riches out there. For the ultimate in a flexible analog system, go for the largely DIY &lt;a href=&#34;http://bulletjournal.com/&#34;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt;. There are tons of inspiring (and intimidating) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=bullet%20journal&amp;amp;rs=typed&amp;amp;term_meta%5B%5D=bullet%7Ctyped&amp;amp;term_meta%5B%5D=journal%7Ctyped&#34;&gt;examples on Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; and people’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://alastairjohnston.co.uk/cracking-the-bullet-journal-forward-planning-problem/&#34;&gt;personal blogs&lt;/a&gt;. Unless they are dead set on something digital, I recommend that my clients give Bullet Journaling a go - it feels a bit awkward at first, but becomes quite satisfying very quickly. Speaking of digital options, &lt;a href=&#34;https://evernote.com/&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.onenote.com/&#34;&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; have various task management systems built in, but I personally prefer to use these systems better as reference tools, and  mixing reference and task capture systems seems to muddy the mental waters. Other people swear by them as task management tools, though, so go with it if it feels right for you. The above mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wunderlist.com/&#34;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; is an easy (and free) online/mobile tool, and it’s what I use for recurring checklists. It’s also owned by Microsoft, and you’re starting to see the first few indications of integration with the rest of the Office Suite, which might create some useful workflows. A friend of mine prefers &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stripes-checklist-list-manager/id844840340?mt=8&#34;&gt;Stripes&lt;/a&gt; as more aesthetically pleasing and less clunky for his own checklists. For calendars, I recommend you just go with whatever calendar you are already using due to work or personal constraints - which probably means one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/calendar&#34;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icloud.com/#calendar&#34;&gt;Apple Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://products.office.com/en-us/business/microsoft-office-365-frequently-asked-questions&#34;&gt;Microsoft Outlook&lt;/a&gt;. You might have some good reasons for keeping work and personal calendars separate, but if you can at all avoid it and consolidate things, I recommend you do. Finally, to return to analog options, there are a variety of pre-printed planners out there. One very nice brand that seems to cater more to the ladies is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://daydesigner.com/&#34;&gt;Day Designer&lt;/a&gt; - I’ve yet to find something  as nice and comprehensive in a more macho style, but my wife swears by hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task capture is just one piece of a complete &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/4/10/designing-your-own-productivity-framework&#34;&gt;Productivity Framework&lt;/a&gt;, but even if you do nothing else besides write down what you have to do, you are way ahead of the pack. Getting work out of your head will give you a great sense of mental clarity, will improve your consistency in keeping track of slippery tasks, and will help to make everything on your plate a lot more palatable by breaking it into bite-sized, visible tasks. Don’t worry about getting it perfect from the start - you almost definitely won’t, and will have to tweak and adjust as you go, but that’s the beauty of continuous improvement. Have I missed any of your favorite task capture tools? Any approaches I haven’t touched on here? &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jeff.powell.russell@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jeff&#39;s Recommended Self-Improvement Reading</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-11-jeffs-recommended-self-improvement-reading/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-11-jeffs-recommended-self-improvement-reading/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-11-jeffs-recommended-self-improvement-reading/ -&lt;p&gt;Below is an annotated list of some of my favorite books related to self-improvement and the general pursuit of excellence. It’s a pretty long list, so feel free to skip around to the areas that most grab your interest and come back to revisit when you’re looking for something new. It’s by no means comprehensive, and I’ve always got a whole stack of books waiting to be read, so expect updates and additions down the road. The books below are listed alphabetically by author’s last name within each category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time for even skipping around to your favorite categories? Check out my top three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tldr-top-three&#34;&gt;The TL;DR Top Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the following list is pretty extensive, and I know you’ve got plenty to do, so here are the three that I would recommend everyone here read regardless of your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306853&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Ferriss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed from hundreds of interviews available as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/podcast/&#34;&gt;The Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast, this book deconstructs the habits, ways of thinking, and tools of top performers in multiple fields, from Arnold Schwarzennegger to Tony Robbins, there’s something in here for everybody. If you’re unfamiliar with Tim Ferriss and don’t have a more specific need (like working out or learning to cook), I recommend this book as the best starting place, as it captures much of what is in his other three, but with added insight and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306901&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=deep+work&#34;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most recent additions to this list, this book has changed my life. I know you hear that all the time, but I literally mean every day of my life I consciously plan, act, and reflect differently since reading this book than I did before. Recommended to me by a close friend who is as obsessed with personal betterment as I am, it makes the case that in a world of increasing education and automation, the key differentiating skill you can build is the ability to focus deeply on things that matter. I especially recommend this book if you struggle with distraction, feel hassled or hurried all the time, or ever wonder what happened to the days where you could sit and concentrate on one thing for hours at a time. You can sample a lot of Cal’s work at his excellent blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Study Hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310766&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+war+of+art&#34;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Pressfield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; called this “The most important book you’ve never read” in his forward to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Do-Work-Overcome-Resistance-Your/dp/1936891379/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307018&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=turning+pro&#34;&gt;Do the Work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I keep a copy where I can see it at all times, and it has deeply influenced how I think about work and productivity and life. It’s core argument is that we are all struggling against &lt;em&gt;Resistance&lt;/em&gt;, an active, malignant force that grows out of our evolutionarily-derived monkey brains and the pressures of society to hold us back from achieving what we might and to share our individual spark with the world. Extremely motivating and extremely brief - I read it on a flight from Houston to Dallas and was finished before we got to the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;excellence&#34;&gt;Excellence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since studying Classics and Ancient History in college, I have been obsessed with the concept of &lt;em&gt;arete -&lt;/em&gt; a Greek word that captures the related concepts of excellence and virtue and striving to be the best. It has shaped my love of self-improvement, and it is constantly in my mind. These two books embody that concept, giving specific directions on how to strive for &lt;em&gt;arete&lt;/em&gt;, even if they don’t call it that. If you only read one book on this list, I recommend one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306853&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Ferriss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed from hundreds of interviews available as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/podcast/&#34;&gt;The Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast, this book deconstructs the habits, ways of thinking, and tools of top performers in multiple fields, from Arnold Schwarzennegger to Tony Robbins, there’s something in here for everybody. If you’re unfamiliar with Tim Ferriss and don’t have a more specific need (like working out or learning to cook), I recommend this book as the best starting place, as it captures much of what is in his other three, but with added insight and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306901&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=deep+work&#34;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most recent additions to this list, this book has changed my life. I know you hear that all the time, but I literally mean every day of my life I consciously plan, act, and reflect differently since reading this book than I did before. Recommended to me by a close friend who is as obsessed with personal betterment as I am, it makes the case that in a world of increasing education and automation, the key differentiating skill you can build is the ability to focus deeply on things that matter. I especially recommend this book if you struggle with distraction, feel hassled or hurried all the time, or ever wonder what happened to the days where you could sit and concentrate on one thing for hours at a time. You can sample a lot of Cal’s work at his excellent blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Study Hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;productivity&#34;&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a personal favorite topic of mine, and the one where I find myself most often helping coaching clients. While it is only a piece of improving your life, it is one that has ripple effects in all other areas. Getting better at using your time, at working in an effective way, and at keeping track of what you need to do frees up mental bandwidth for the more interesting stuff and opens up your calendar to give you time to decide what you want to do - whether that’s start a business or put ships in bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306936&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=getting+things+done&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; by David Allen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 800 pound gorilla of personal productivity books, and with good reason. David Allen clearly analyzes what stops us from being productive and breaks down work into separate tasks that can be optimized, and then delivers a totalized system for doing so. I use several of the concepts from this book in my own life and productivity coaching, but let me give you a word of caution: if you try to jump into this whole hog from day one, you are setting yourself up for trouble. It’s just too much stuff at once to do on your own for effective behavioral change. I have found the blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://restartgtd.com/falling-off-the-gtd-wagon/&#34;&gt;Restart GTD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a tremendously useful supplementary resource, and it led me to one of the books I recommend below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Interactive-ebook/dp/B01069X4H0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306962&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Covey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The granddaddy of self-improvement books here, it really focuses on a wider area than just productivity and time management, but that is what it is best known for. It synthesizes the information from hundreds of previously written self help books and lays out seven big picture habits for an effective life. My personal favorite is Habit #7, which is &lt;em&gt;Sharpen the Saw&lt;/em&gt; - the reminder that from time to time you have to step back from the work you’re doing and improve your tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge-ebook/dp/B002WE46UW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306989&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=four+hour+work+week&#34;&gt;The Four Hour Workweek&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Ferriss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book that kicked off my own personal journey into productivity and self-improvement more generally - as well as turning me into a lifelong Tim Ferriss fanboy. I credit it with my ability to simultaneously do a great job at work, crush an MBA, and land a management consulting job. While a lot of the specific tools and strategies recommended are extremely useful, this book is most valuable for forcing you to re-examine your assumptions about careers, entrepreneurship, and what you’re uncomfortable doing. Check out Tim’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for a taste of his approach and the kinds of material you might find in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Do-Work-Overcome-Resistance-Your/dp/1936891379/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307018&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=turning+pro&#34;&gt;Do the Work&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Pressfield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sequel of sorts to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310766&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+war+of+art&#34;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; below, and it is extremely encouraging in a gruff sort of way. I recommend reading both together, and then revisiting whichever one you think you need every year or so for the rest of your life. They’re both short, you can read them both in an afternoon. Here, Pressfield argues that the best way to overcome Resistance (more on that below) is a dogged workmanlike professionalism, and then proceeds to detail specific actions to take to develop that attitude. While the book is geared towards creative types, using the writing of a book as its case study, I find it is equally applicable to knowledge work of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exercise--behavioral-change&#34;&gt;Exercise &amp;amp; Behavioral Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lumped these two together because there’s a lot of overlap between habit building and exercise, especially any kind of reading about exercise. At the end of the day, we all know that to exercise, we need to do things that are hard physically, and do them regularly. Everything beyond that is details, which is why it’s so important to figure out the doing it regularly piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/House-That-Cleans-Itself-ebook/dp/B00BFH3UX6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307061&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+house+that+cleans+itself&#34;&gt;The House that Cleans Itself&lt;/a&gt; by Mindy Starns Clark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one is a bit of an odd ball on this list, but here me out. I stumbled onto this book through the blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://restartgtd.com/falling-off-the-gtd-wagon/&#34;&gt;Restart GTD&lt;/a&gt;, and while it has a lot of great advice on how to make it easier to keep your home neat, it also taught me one of the most valuable behavioral change insights I’ve ever come across: &lt;em&gt;if you have tried to do the right thing multiple times and failed, the answer is to make doing the right thing easier.&lt;/em&gt; It sounds ludicrously simple, but we have all fallen into the trap of “well, this time I’ll do the same thing I’ve tried before, but I’ll try harder.” Trying harder isn’t the right answer, you were trying hard last time. This book shows you a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307088&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+four+hour+body&#34;&gt;The Four Hour Body&lt;/a&gt;  by Tim Ferriss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a ton of material on exercise in this list, which makes it look under-emphasized or unimportant, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Exercise is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; practice that will have the biggest multiplicative effect on your life. Besides being stronger and faster (which is cool), you’ll also be smarter, happier, and healthier. Simply put, exercising makes you better at life. This book is my favorite guide to ways to optimize your approach to diet and exercise in a way that gets you the most positive outcome for the least effort necessary. &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490306853&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tools+of+titans&#34;&gt;Tools of Titans&lt;/a&gt; covers a lot of new ground in these areas, but &lt;em&gt;The Four Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; helps to encourage the approach and mindset you need to realize you really can make massive changes to your body, health, and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a passion for learning and want to do so as effectively as possible. These books focus on the skill of “meta-learning” - in other words, how you get better at the act of learning itself. These will act as accelerators for your interest in any of the other categories you see in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything-ebook/dp/B005NJU8PA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307113&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+four+hour+chef&#34;&gt;The Four Hour Chef&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Ferriss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, this Tim Ferriss guy keeps showing up on here, doesn’t he? This is another book “in disguise” like &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/House-That-Cleans-Itself-ebook/dp/B00BFH3UX6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307061&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+house+that+cleans+itself&#34;&gt;The House that Cleans Itself&lt;/a&gt;. While it bills itself as a cookbook that will take you from “how do I boil water?” to complex and impressive meals, all of that is really a vehicle for teaching you meta-learning. Worth the price of admission for the first chapter alone, which breaks down Tim’s approach to learning new skills and tells you how to do the same. Oh yeah, and the recipes are pretty delicious as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Pursuit-Excellence-ebook/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307155&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+art+of+learning&#34;&gt;The Art of Learning&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Waitzkin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie &lt;em&gt;Searching for Bobby Fisher&lt;/em&gt;, and he has displayed a remarkable ability to learn and compete across a wide variety of fields from chess to Brazilian Ju Jitsu. This book discusses his approach to learning and distills it down to principles. It is a bit less immediately practical than some  of the other books on this list, but it is deeply wise and rewards re-reads and ongoing study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;philosophy--motivation&#34;&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all too easy to look past philosophy as some ivory tower pursuit divorced from day to day life - and indeed, a lot of more recent philosophy has become that. But when you turn back to the practical wisdom of the Stoics or Lao Tzu or the Buddha, you find specific recommendations on how to live the best life possible. These books will be especially useful in helping you figure out why exactly you care about being able to get more stuff done or build new habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Modern-Library-ebook/dp/B000FC1JAI/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310624&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=marcus+aurelius+meditations&#34;&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt; by Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends handed me a copy of this book my freshman year of college and said “read this, it’s good for you.” And man, was he right. Since then, the stoics have made up one of the biggest chunks of my personal philosophical thinking and reading. &lt;em&gt;Meditations&lt;/em&gt; is great because Marcus Aurelius wrote it to himself, often in the form of short admonitions that make good instructions for us trying to follow the same example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Mindfulness-HarperOne-Select-Selects-ebook/dp/B005HG4H24/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310652&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=art+of+mindfulness&#34;&gt;The Art of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; by Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delightful and brief book explains how to incorporate habits of mindfulness into your life. I’ve used it to find ways to meditate while walking into work from the parking garage, making coffee, or even just watching the wind in the trees. I have found meditation an extremely valuable habit to pick up, and this book is a nice straightforward primer. I’ve also recently been enjoying the blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://liveanddare.com/&#34;&gt;Live and Dare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which has a nice, comprehensive &lt;a href=&#34;http://liveanddare.com/types-of-meditation/&#34;&gt;explanation of the different types of meditation&lt;/a&gt;. A useful explanation of a term that often gets thrown around without being made very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday-ebook/dp/B015NTIXWE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310679&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=ego+is+the+enemy&#34;&gt;Ego is the Enemy&lt;/a&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent examination of how Ego cripples our ability to succeed, destroys us when we’re on top, and pours gasoline on the fire when we fail. It uses numerous historical examples, good and bad, such as General Sherman and Howard Hughes, Jr. It is one of his works on applying stoic philosophy to the modern world, and I have found it a thoroughly useful corrective when I start getting too big for my britches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz-ebook/dp/B00SI02BW4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310704&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=psycho+cybernetics&#34;&gt;Psycho-Cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; by Maxwell Maltz, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an oldie-but-goodie. Don’t be thrown off by the slightly goofy title, which might make you think of &lt;em&gt;Terminator.&lt;/em&gt; It was a pioneering work in the importance of making use of your psychology to achieve your goals, and the role that internal self talk and visualization play in that. The tone can feel a little dated, but if you imagine of those 1950’s advertisement poster cartoons narrating it to you, it becomes charming rather than distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry-ebook/dp/B0026772N8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310742&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=zen+and+the+art+of+motorcycle+maintenance&#34;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Pirsig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have revisited this book time and again. The first time I read it, I found much to disagree with, but it was still deeply thought provoking. Over time, I’ve come to find it more and more useful and convincing. Probably my favorite aspect of it is how it finds the common threads in Eastern and Western philosophy. Not a lot of specific “how to” advice here, but it is remarkably valuable for making you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310766&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+war+of+art&#34;&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Pressfield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; called this “The most important book you’ve never read” in his forward to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Do-Work-Overcome-Resistance-Your/dp/1936891379/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490307018&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=turning+pro&#34;&gt;Do the Work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I keep a copy where I can see it at all times, and it has deeply influenced how I think about work and productivity and life. It’s core argument is that we are all struggling against &lt;em&gt;Resistance&lt;/em&gt;, an active, malignant force that grows out of our evolutionarily-derived monkey brains and the pressures of society to hold us back from achieving what we might and to share our individual spark with the world. Extremely motivating and extremely brief - I read it on a flight from Houston to Dallas and was finished before we got to the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Awaken-Giant-Within-Immediate-Emotional-ebook/dp/B001EM101Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490310796&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=awaken+the+giant+within&#34;&gt;Awaken the Giant Within&lt;/a&gt; by Tony Robbins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Robbins is energetic and motivating to the point of intimidation. I as myself “how can that guy be so pumped all the time?” Well, this book is your starting place. I consider it a manual for overhauling your mental operating system. Whether you want to quit smoking or start a business, this book has the specific techniques you need to make it happen. It’s a bit long, but that’s because there’s a ton of valuable stuff in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Letters-Stoic-Epistulae-Morales-Lucilium-ebook/dp/B005NC0MGW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&#34;&gt;Letters from a Stoic&lt;/a&gt; by Lucius Annaeus Seneca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun note - &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanholiday.net/&#34;&gt;Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, and I’ve since observed the same thing, that people who like Stoic philosophy come in two flavors: Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. One or the other just seems to “click” with people, where the other doesn’t to the same degree. I enjoy both and find them both useful, but I’ve gotta count myself a Seneca man. He wrote these letters to a friend and protege of his in a very straightforward, friendly, and approachable manner. He uses practical examples and sympathizes with the difficulties of following stoic advice. The letters are also available as an audio book called &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tao-Seneca-Practical-Letters-Master/dp/B01AIXEJ0U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311080&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tao+of+seneca&#34;&gt;The Tao of Seneca&lt;/a&gt;, which I was looking forward to recommending based on the samples I’ve heard via the &lt;em&gt;Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/em&gt; (he published it and recorded the forward), but the Amazon reviews indicate that the audio quality is poor - so check it out at your own risk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto-ebook/dp/B0083DJWGO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311253&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=antifragile&#34;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt; by Nassim Nicholas Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of all of Taleb’s works, but this was the one that hooked me and the one I come back to most often. It contains useful advice on personal finance and organizational design and diet, but really it is a work of philosophy, and it’s central premise is to highlight the existence of things that are neither fragile nor durable, but actually antifragile - they are improved by exposure to time, chance, and chaos. Things like your immune system or life on this planet as a whole all get better by exposure to “bad” things. I think of this book’s discussion of risk and what it really means daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Text-Only/dp/0679724346/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=0679724346&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=6JZGESCM69BJGFCTBYAG&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=Qb2fq&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=ntLSh&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=6JZGESCM69BJGFCTBYAG&#34;&gt;The Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt; by Lao Tzu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptic and mysterious, the seemingly paradoxical nature of much of this work is precisely its value. As a rational, straightforward kind of guy, I often have trouble thinking in more oblique or ambiguous ways, and this book is excellent training in that. I’d also point out that with all works originally composed in a foreign language, the selection of a translation can make all the difference in how useful, intelligible, or engaging it is. I’ve linked here to a well-regarded translation, but any time you’re considering buying a translated work, do some googling to find people’s thoughts on the different versions and compare the pros/cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another wonderfully brief but extremely valuable book, this one steps through the process for coming up with creative ideas individually. While we’re all familiar by now with the idea that the subconscious works on things under the radar and suddenly ideas will seemingly appear, this book lays out the crucial steps before and after “just put it out of mind for awhile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Min-Basadur-Power-Innovation-Solutions/dp/B00SB2KUL8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311552&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=the+power+of+innovation+basadur&#34;&gt;The Power of Innovation&lt;/a&gt; by Min Basadur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit harder to find and lesser known, but details several tools that have transformed my professional life and greatly enhanced my ability to be creative consistently and effectively. Recommended to me by one of my mentors in consulting who studied with Dr. Basadur, this work emphasizes the importance of separating active &lt;em&gt;di&lt;/em&gt;vergence and active &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;vergence, and details an 8 step creative problem solving cycle that can be usefully applied to all manner of business and personal situations. An extremely powerful set of tools for working creatively in any field, whether alone or as part of a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Whack-Side-Head-More-Creative-ebook/dp/B005DO9TW8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311589&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=whack+on+the+side+of+the+head&#34;&gt;A Whack on the Side of the Head&lt;/a&gt; by Roger von Oech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly well-known classic, this book is great for the practical tools it provides for being more creative. My personal favorite tool is the use of “oracles” - some kind of randomized input that you then have to make sense of. This technique can produce amazingly creative results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Step-ebook/dp/B003V1WTLI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311609&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=lateral+thinking&#34;&gt;Lateral Thinking&lt;/a&gt; by Edward de Bono&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, de Bono spells out the difference between traditionally logical linear thinking, such as you use in mathematics, and the more freewheeling lateral thinking. He is careful throughout not to denigrate linear thinking, as it is necessary and useful in a lot of super important contexts, like science, but he does emphasize that lateral thinking has gotten the short end of the stick in our logic-worshipping western culture. The most exciting insight from this book for me was the notion that sometimes you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to have a bad or silly idea in order to get to a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-finance&#34;&gt;Personal Finance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don’t especially focus on personal finance, it is an essential element to get right in an extraordinary life, and I’ve found the following books very useful in thinking about and taking action on my own financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich-ebook/dp/B004WL4BW6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311629&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich&#34;&gt;I Will Teach You to Be Rich&lt;/a&gt; by Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of Ramit’s, and I’ve purchased several of his courses online after reading and getting use out of this book. The actual financial advice here is reasonably straightforward and not too dissimilar from what you’d find elsewhere, but Ramit’s focus is on psychology and actually changing behavior, which is what I think makes this book stand out from the rest. It gives step by step instructions to build &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; for consistently doing smart things with money automatically rather than wagging its finger at you to put together a detailed budget. If you want to set up some interesting compare and contrast, pair with my newest favorite money blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/&#34;&gt;Mr. Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom-ebook/dp/B00MZAIU4G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311653&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=money%3A+master+the+game&#34;&gt;Money: Master the Game&lt;/a&gt; by Tony Robbins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a bit of a doozy, but it is jam packed with specific advice and insights from some of the world’s most successful people in finance and investment. As with his other works, Tony makes it a point to step you through why something is important, what actions you need to take, and committing to yourself that you will take them. If you are already reasonably well versed in investments and personal finance, a fair chunk of this book will be remedial, but the advanced stuff is pretty great. My favorite technique from this book was pre-committing to a fixed percentage of all raises that will go straight into savings/investments so that you can increase your savings year over year and not even notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leadership--management&#34;&gt;Leadership &amp;amp; Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a background in management consulting and the military, I get pretty excited about organizations and the people who direct them. These are a few of my favorites on how to run effective teams and get results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311670&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=extreme+ownership&#34;&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/a&gt; by Leif Babin &amp;amp; Jocko Willink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by that stereotypical designator of badassitude “ex Navy SEALs”, this book has the highest bang for buck of any on leadership I’ve ever read. It presents simple (but not easy) leadership principles and illustrates them with engaging illustrations from the authors’ time in Ar-Ramadi, Iraq. Where I turn to Tony Robbins when I need to be more enthusiastic, I turn to Jocko when I need to be more of a hardass - this book will challenge you to be better and make you believe you can. One of the authors, Jocko Willink, also has his own &lt;a href=&#34;http://jockopodcast2.com/&#34;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; that I find extremely enjoyable and educational - and it will reveal the incredibly thoughtful and reflective mind that doesn’t necessarily come to mind when you hear “ex Navy SEAL”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Managerial-Moment-Truth-Essential-Performance-ebook/dp/B000GCFXS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311689&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=managerial+moment+of+truth&#34;&gt;The Managerial Moment of Truth&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Bodaken &amp;amp; Robert Fritz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also recommended to me by a mentor in consulting, this book attacks the endemic problem of ineffective feedback and mediocre organizations due to a lack of honesty. Not that most folks are actually lying, this book makes it crystal clear that in unpleasant situations like falling short at work, it is all too easy to accept flattering or comforting views of reality instead of figuring out what to improve. It provides a step by step procedure for managers to instead give accurate, useful feedback that people can really act on. The most valuable habit from it is the seemingly simple technique to state and get agreement on the objective truth of what has happened that will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex-ebook/dp/B00KWG9OF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311706&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=team+of+teams&#34;&gt;Team of Teams&lt;/a&gt; by Stanley McChrystal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book describes the challenges faced by the Joint Special Operations Command under General McChrystal in Iraq as they were facing off against Al Qaeda in Iraq in the aftermath of the coalition invasion, and the steps they took to address them. It describes their lessons learned in building organizational agility within the enormous bureaucratic monstrosity of the United States military and the remarkable results they achieved. I have used this book to inform my thinking on how to scale Agile work practices in large enterprises. This book pairs perfectly with the next one down on Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half-ebook/dp/B00JI54HCU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490311758&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=scrum+the+art+of+doing+twice+the+work+in+half+the+time&#34;&gt;Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time&lt;/a&gt; by Jeff Sutherland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutherland describes a project management methodology that was developed in the world of software development and is one way of embodying the &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemanifesto.org/&#34;&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;’s ethos. What I have found using this method in several strategy consulting engagements is that it is extremely effective in other fields as well. While I don’t recommend you try to use the full-on Scrum methodology to run your own personal life, I have found the concepts of quantifying tasks by how much “effort” they’ll take along with retrospectives to facilitate continuous improvement absolutely invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew, thanks for making it with me all the way down here! These books have had the biggest impact on my own self-improvement journey. Do you have any favorites that you don’t see? &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jeff.powell.russell@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; what they are! I’m always looking for new tools, new ways of thinking, and insights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning is Indispensable</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-11-planning-is-indispensable/ -&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning is something that I resisted for a long time. I thought it would be stifling and a pain in the ass, with no real benefit. Oh how wrong I was. Now that I have made planning a major part of how I work, I find myself far less stressed, I rarely feel overwhelmed, and I have made significant progress on personal and professional goals.  In addition to simply thinking about what to do ahead of time, I have found a powerful “force multiplier” in the form of prioritizing work with a method called “Three to Thrive.” Many of us avoid getting started with planning and prioritization because it feels a bit intimidating, but I’m going to share a couple of simple, lightweight ways to introduce them into your life pain free, so that you too can enjoy the clarity and flexibility they bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point to keep in mind is that Planning is about the process, not the output. You will rarely (if ever) follow a plan exactly, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. A lot of us avoid planning out of an intuitive sense that circumstances will quickly stop us from following our intended course of action. As the Prussian Chief of Staff &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Moltke-Art-War-Selected-Writings-ebook/dp/B002DMZ9PO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1491517449&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=von+moltke&#34;&gt;Helmuth von Moltke&lt;/a&gt; said, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder&#34;&gt;no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first contact with the main hostile force&lt;/a&gt;” (you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the catchier paraphrase, “no plan survives contact with the enemy”, but we believe in accuracy here at Jeffco Industries). We get nervous thinking about this inevitability. I know that I sometimes catch myself feeling anxious when I start to deviate from the plan. Fortunately for me, &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; has offered the antidote to that particular poison. He describes the way that planning is &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/08/14/deep-habits-process-trumps-results-for-daily-planning/&#34;&gt;a valuable mental &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that exactly following your schedule to the minute matters far less than the mental workout. Planning trains your brain to actually think about what matters, to realize you have to make trade offs between what you can and can’t try to accomplish in one day, and to not constantly operate in reactive mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest form of planning is the traditional &amp;ldquo;to do&amp;rdquo; list or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/learnonsteroids/SJCI93jfks9ijuquougjksnd908b89djijDr2-Feb/WeeklyDailyGoals.pdf&#34;&gt;a list of goals&lt;/a&gt;. Even this small step is a giant leap ahead of most people. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what&amp;rsquo;s become typical. You come into work and immediately check your email. Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t make it to the office, or even out of bed, before you check. As soon as your day begins, you&amp;rsquo;re reacting to what others need or want, and you spend the rest of the day putting out fires and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bunkstrutts.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/kitty-whack-a-mole1.gif&#34;&gt;whacking moles&lt;/a&gt;. Sound familiar? Now I want you to imagine a different day. You have a plan not to check email until you’ve had an hour or two of high quality work. You come in, you knock it out. Then, when you open up your inbox, it’s because you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;decided&lt;/em&gt; you’re ready to field new challenges and help other people out. How empowering would that feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal list doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be excessively detailed or even very complete - maybe you just write down a handful of things &lt;a href=&#34;http://img.memecdn.com/to-do-list_o_153739.gif&#34;&gt;you want to be sure of&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/04/02/635951676205537820-681818248_tumblr_inline_nzkxu6xAxL1qcq7oa_500.gif&#34;&gt;wing the rest&lt;/a&gt;. If you find yourself allergic to &amp;ldquo;to do&amp;rdquo; lists or daily goals, another simple but effective method is to block off parts of your day for working on specific projects. For example, you fire up Outlook, find an open hour, and create an appointment that says &amp;ldquo;Novel&amp;rdquo;. During that time, you do whatever you need to make progress on your novel, but you&amp;rsquo;re free to decide in the moment. Set up a few of these, and you start to have a pretty robust plan for your day, with &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; space in between left for the reactive stuff we all have to deal with. Whichever method you choose, a time will come when you have to change your plan. Maybe your boss dumps something urgent in your lap, or you wildly overestimate how much you can get done today (I’m especially prone to this one), but as you adjust your plan, you get even more practice at assessing what to do, and your brain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2017/03/23/neurosci-of-expertise/&#34;&gt;strengthens the connections&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can really power up your planning when you add in &lt;strong&gt;Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;. It forces you to make strategic judgements about how you use your time and brain power. All strategy means trade offs - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/questions-successful-managers-ask-employees-2016-3&#34;&gt;choosing to do one thing instead of other things&lt;/a&gt;. Well, perhaps I should say all &lt;a href=&#34;http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Buttermilk-the-Goat-knocks-down-other-goat.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; strategy does&lt;/a&gt;. As Peter Drucker argues in &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials-ebook/dp/B01F1WZGNC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1491518662&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=effective+executive&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Effective Executive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is far more important to figure out &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do than it is to figure out &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do it efficiently. Efficiency is a wonderful thing, and all of us here certainly love it and seek it out, but effectiveness has to come first. Prioritization is the point of contact between your judgment of effectiveness and the world. Many people who make use of some kind of task capture tool fall into the common trap of checking off all the easy things and then saying “look how much I got done!” (I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t know that from personal experience, I assure you). Prioritization forces you to confront your tendency to shy away from the hard stuff that matters and put it in check by identifying what’s important to you in a moment of calm and foresight. Tim Ferriss likes to ask himself “&lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/&#34;&gt;what would make all of my other tasks easier or not matter?&lt;/a&gt;” This is an incredibly powerful question, and I frequently use it to help clients select a goal to pursue in coaching, but you can apply it at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to day to day planning, though, my favorite prioritization method is to choose &amp;ldquo;Three to Thrive” for the day. I’ve adopted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tony-robbins-morning-ritual_us_57c4ae57e4b09cd22d922f78&#34;&gt;this method&lt;/a&gt; from Tony Robbins. It’s very simple: look over your list of things you’re planning to do today, and pick three of them as your “Three to Thrive” (I draw a little &lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b4/dd/3a/b4dd3a0b3396580057090e4ed7731791.jpg&#34;&gt;triforce&lt;/a&gt; next to the actions in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://bulletjournal.com/&#34;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt;). If you complete these three things, you “win” the day. And there you are, you’ve just prioritized your day. A more extreme version of prioritization is to identify &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results-ebook/dp/B00C1BHQXK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1491536340&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+one+thing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The One Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that is most important today and do that. I prefer Three to Thrive for myself and my clients for a few reasons. First, it’s reasonably constrained - three things are not that many things. On the other hand, if you are new to prioritization, the pressure of choosing just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; most important thing can make your brain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221992388_Training_in_creative_problem_solving_Effects_on_ideation_and_problem_finding_and_solving_in_an_industrial_research_organization&#34;&gt;seize up&lt;/a&gt;. Ever tried to answer the question “what’s your favorite movie?” and been at a loss for words? Same deal. Having three things gives your brain a bit of breathing room to worry a little less about getting it “right”, which paradoxically &lt;a href=&#34;http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1158&amp;amp;context=creativeprojects&#34;&gt;makes it easier to do&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, if you are hustling to get multiple projects done, this gives you a way to balance that out. Let’s say you’ve got a day job and are building an online business on the side. You can set a little rule for yourself that every day one of your three to thrive has to be for your day job and another for your business, with your third one as a “flex” priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily planning and prioritization is your first step in taking strategic control of your life. Once you build the habit of thinking about your day and making choices about what to focus on ahead of time, it becomes much easier to apply the same logic to your week, or your quarter. Plans are also valuable after the fact - with a written plan, you can look back and compare it against what really happened. This reflection will let you learn some valuable things about what you were assuming, what you thought would be important, and what actually happened. For example, I recently reviewed my “three to thrive” for each day of the past quarter and had some powerful insights about what had and hadn’t helped move my life in the direction I wanted it to go that weren&amp;rsquo;t obvious when I was making my daily plan. The most unexpected benefit of having a plan,and possibly the best one, is that it actually gives you &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; flexibility to improvise rather than less, because everything else is assessed and under control.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing Your Own Productivity Framework</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-10-designing-your-own-productivity-framework/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-10-designing-your-own-productivity-framework/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-10-designing-your-own-productivity-framework/ -&lt;p&gt;There is an unimaginably huge amount of material out there on productivity, self-improvement, and achievement. Books, blogs, podcasts, online courses: the works. Some of it is amazing, some of it is crap, but most of it is specific and narrowly focused - which is awesome when you are tackling a particular challenge that it addresses. The material that goes broader tends to be presented as a total, self-contained package. The trouble with the former is that you need a way to organize your ever-widening array of tools, and the problem with the latter is that the only person any productivity system works perfectly for is the one who invented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, productivity is only one piece of building a kickass life for yourself, but it is the motor that drives the rest, and getting good at it will accelerate your progress in developing all of the others. If you’ve heard me speak, you know how excited I get about this stuff. So today I’m going to share how I think about breaking down productivity frameworks into their constituent building blocks, so that you can construct your own custom-built system, Lego style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this productivity system will help you kick ass in lots of ways. First and most obviously, you will get more work done. The great thing about being productive, though, is that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get to decide what to do the time you’re using more efficiently, whether that is building your own business or doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macram%C3%A9&#34;&gt;macrame&lt;/a&gt;. Really, whatever works for you. Without time pressuring you into making mistakes or accepting a shallow understanding of what you’re doing, whatever work you decide to do will also be &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/&#34;&gt;higher quality&lt;/a&gt;. The coolest and most surprising benefit I have found is the tremendous &lt;a href=&#34;http://cogprints.org/6289/&#34;&gt;mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;, which lets me indulge in strategic and creative thought, unimpeded by nagging worries and trivial to dos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first element you need is a big picture reason to put up with the effort it’ll take to build these new habits. Once they’re established, the whole thing becomes much easier, that’s the whole point of habits, after all. Initially, though, there will be some times where you ask yourself “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2013/11/resistance-and-self-loathing/&#34;&gt;why am I putting myself through all this crap?&lt;/a&gt;” Having a clear goal to achieve or an overarching purpose for getting more work done will also help lay the groundwork for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2006/03/24/living-up-to-our-full-potential/&#34;&gt;balancing achievement with fulfillment&lt;/a&gt;. Just like money or possessions, though, self-improvement can fall prey to the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/931385/youre-probably-searching-for-a-better-life-but-what-if-you-already-have-it/?utm_source=qzfb&#34;&gt;Disease of More&lt;/a&gt;”, where it becomes its own goal, never satisfied. One piece of the puzzle is to enjoy the journey for its own sake, but you’ll also want to take Ferris Bueller’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo&#34;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; by having some milestones to savor once you get to them. So right now, while you’re fired up and motivated, I recommend you settle on a tangible, external goal that you can clearly point to when it’s achieved, such as “land my dream job” or “get three paying clients” or the like, and then write it down somewhere you’ll see it every day. No really - that last part is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your goal settled, the next thing you&amp;rsquo;ll need is a way to keep track of what to do - a way to &lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt; work. As David Allen has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedolectures.com/david-allen-the-mind-is-for-having-ideas-not-holding-them/#.WN08NxLysQ8&#34;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;your brain is for having ideas, not storing them.&amp;rdquo; The more you try to keep holed up there, the less bandwidth for valuable creative and strategic thinking. An effective Capture tool has two essential elements: it is as complete as possible and you trust it. Most of us are pretty good at staying on top of what we have to do at work, but if you’ve ever felt the frustration of suddenly realizing you have an important personal matter that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi-7KwM4GWI&#34;&gt;fell off your radar&lt;/a&gt;, then you know why it is important to have as &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; a capture tool as possible. Ideally, you want a home in that system for everything you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you to get any use out of your complete capture system, you need to &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; it. Ever written something down on a sticky note and then found that note months later, task utterly forgotten? Or how about that time you bought a fancy new planner and put it away after a week?  Those are systems you don’t trust. To really get those tasks out of your head, you have to believe deep down in your gut that everything you need to do is in your system and if it’s not in your system you don’t need to do it. An often overlooked piece of building trust in your capture system is to find one that you actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; using and find pleasant. It sounds a bit silly, but when it comes to behavioral modification, we already have so much &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490894007&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=war+of+art&#34;&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; that we need to remove as many sources of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK1ch07.html&#34;&gt;friction&lt;/a&gt; as possible. An easy way to do that is to find something that feels less like a chore and more like a hobby. Maybe it’s the little “ding!” in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wunderlist.com/&#34;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; or a carefully hand drawn calendar in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://bulletjournal.com/&#34;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; - the important part is that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good chunk of the tasks that you’ll need to capture won’t just pop into your brain. We get requests, invitations, directives, and opportunities. So we have to figure out how to sort through these incoming message and identify what actions to take. The trouble is that the valuable items come all mixed in with a lot of other “stuff” - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE&#34;&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.duffelblog.com/&#34;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&amp;amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fdims-shared%2Fdims3%2FGLOB%2Fcrop%2F5184x3456%2B0%2B0%2Fresize%2F1600x1067%21%2Fformat%2Fjpg%2Fquality%2F85%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fdc494cc630ee35fd092a3f790234db95%2F201793312%2FphprvBP3o&amp;amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;amp;signature=d6858270b410c030e93053330e7319af122dec9b&#34;&gt;facebook updates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/imgfave/image_cache/1293855946963071.png&#34;&gt;holiday cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saddlebackleather.com/&#34;&gt;catalogs&lt;/a&gt; - you get the idea. In order to separate the wheat from the chaff, you have to &lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt; these various inboxes. The reason you don’t want to just leave your actions mixed in with all the other stuff is that your brain is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_miser&#34;&gt;fundamentally lazy&lt;/a&gt;. We have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower-limited-resource.pdf&#34;&gt;finite amount&lt;/a&gt; of mental processing power in any given day, and every time you have to sort through a pile of undifferentiated stuff, you have to use some of it up. If you process your inboxes effectively, you only do the sorting once, and you pull out the actions and put them into that capture system we just detailed. To accomplish this, I again draw heavily on David Allen, who has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://facaffairs.med.wayne.edu/pdfs-new/for_gtd_sessions_-_workflow_diagram.pdf&#34;&gt;ugly but comprehensive flow chart&lt;/a&gt; for processing your inbox. The gist of it is that you have two main decisions with a couple of branches below them: Is there an action here? Do I care about keeping this? If there is an action, and it’s yours, you put it into your capture system. Whether there’s an action or not, if you care about keeping it, you put it into some sort of reference system, like saving it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://evernote.com/&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; or an Archive folder in your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve focused on the fairly tactical exercises of getting tasks out of your head and out of your inbox. Remember that extra &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2016/11/27/tools-of-titans-josh-waitzkin-distilled/&#34;&gt;mental bandwidth&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned? Here is where we talk about using it to get more strategic. You do so by &lt;strong&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Reflecting&lt;/strong&gt;. This can start small, such as simply writing a few things you hope to accomplish today and then checking in how you did at the end of the day. Another easy way to build some planning and reflecting into your life is to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal&#34;&gt;Five Minute Journal&lt;/a&gt;. When you start expanding your horizon to the next week or month or quarter, though, you really start to take control of your life and begin to steer it in the direction you want to go. Most folks know the importance of planning and do so to some degree, but reflection is rarer in our future-focused culture and is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ryanholiday.net/an-exercise-in-self-reflection/&#34;&gt;absolutely vital&lt;/a&gt;. The only way you can get better is to look back and assess what worked, what didn’t, and to what degree. Doing so consciously and purposefully will allow you to accelerate your improvement process far past what you can get by only occasionally, passively looking back. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum&#34;&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt; methodology incorporates this concept into its very DNA, holding a retrospective at the end of each 1-3 week block of work. During this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/april/key-elements-of-sprint-retrospective&#34;&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt;, the team talks about what went well and what didn’t and selects one process improvement to focus on for the next sprint. I’ve recently adopted the practice of asking myself the same questions as applied to my personal processes at the end of each week, and I’m already seeing big benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked components of a highly effective personal productivity system is &lt;strong&gt;Focus&lt;/strong&gt;. While you will see major benefits from writing down what you need to do, emptying your inboxes, and taking time to look both backward and forward, you will dramatically increase both the quality and quantity of your output once you really learn to focus. Focus is the skill and habit of doing one thing at a time. That’s it. It’s a simple concept, but remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.optimize.me/inspiring-quotes/leadership-is-simple-but-not-easy/&#34;&gt;simple does not mean easy&lt;/a&gt;. We live in a world of distraction full of pop ups, push notifications, and twenty four hour news. The expert on this topic is &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; - he even wrote the &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490896395&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=deep+work&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on it. In &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;, he talks about how we literally become &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wrike.com/blog/addicted-multitasking-scientific-reasons-you-cant-stop-juggling-work/&#34;&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to task switching and the disastrous effect it has on our ability to think deeply and make things that matter. The good news is that rehabbing your focus muscle is actually pretty easy - you just have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;track the time you focus&lt;/a&gt; on one thing until its done. I like to use an app called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blockandflowapp.com/&#34;&gt;Block &amp;amp; Flow&lt;/a&gt; to do so. It tracks 25 minute focus “blocks” and lets you keep track of your history and categorize different sorts of focus. I have gotten hugely more productive since I started using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those four building blocks - &lt;strong&gt;Capture&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Plan &amp;amp; Reflect&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Focus&lt;/strong&gt; - you have everything you need to dramatically improve your productivity. We opened discussing a big picture goal for building this system, and I’d like to close by once again stepping back to get a wider view. People talk a lot about work/life balance, but really, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you do is your life, and it’s all an interconnected system. So while you might start out adopting some of these practices in the workplace to get that raise or to get up to speed after your new promotion, once you start getting your system working, you’ll start to notice benefits in other areas as well. You’ll be able to devote your full attention to your spouse on date night, you’ll take less time to run errands as you systematize your grocery list, and as you achieve goals, you’ll realize you can set even more ambitious ones. Or perhaps you’ll discover that the procrastination you were trying to fight was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2006/09/24/procrastination-introduction-series/&#34;&gt;masking a deeper dissatisfaction&lt;/a&gt; with your current path and its time to make a major change. Whatever the case, the seemingly straightforward act of improving your productivity will have unexpected and valuable ripple effects throughout your whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the components of a personal productivity system are fairly simple, but you can dig in to any of these subjects in infinite detail - and digging into a small piece of that infinite detail is exactly what I do here! Do you have questions? I answer every email I get, and I look forward to hearing from you. If you’re looking for more specific tips and advice, I’ve got an email-based Productivity Boot Camp that will step you through building the habits for each of these building blocks using proven effective techniques. If you &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jeff.powell.russell@gmail.com&#34;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll receive a free Productivity Field Manual .pdf immediately, along with specific instructions every week for a month to build these habits and help keep you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/coaching/2017-04-10-welcome-and-hello/ -&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog! I use this space to share the very best self-improvement material I come across and my own thoughts and insights based on my experiences coaching highly driven top performers. I believe we’d all be better off if more people adopted the kinds of habits, practices, and ways of thought that are featured here - happier, more accomplished, and tackling bigger and harder problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material on this blog will help you to get more work done, feel less stressed, and to take conscious control of where you’re headed with your career. By getting your day to day work under control, you’ll free up the mental bandwidth to think creatively and strategically, which will let you take deliberate action to set the course for your future. The techniques, habits, and approaches described can not only help advance your career within a traditional corporate environment, they can also finally give you the time to start a small business, freelance on the side, or even just dive into that hobby you’ve been meaning to get to for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am passionate about this kind of material, so I read, watch, and listen to a ton of self-improvement material. Even though I often focus on productivity, I like to range far and wide to find useful insights from unexpected corners - whether that is ancient philosophy, military history, or even advice on keeping your house clean! The internet is full of tips, tricks, hacks, how to’s, and tutorials, but sorting through the plethora of available options and finding the ones that work and linking those into a coherent system is a whole lot of work. So while this blog has its fair share of detailed tactical advice to deal with specific situations, it always strives to connect those tactics to the higher level strategy that guides their selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I like to find quality material from a wide range of sources, and I attribute that broad intellectual palate to my diverse past experience. Studying Classics and Ancient History in college gave me an appreciation for the deep perspective provided by history that spans thousands of years and multiple continents. Enlisting as an airborne infantryman taught me the importance of discipline, adaptability, and aggressive pursuit of your goals. Studying in business school trained me in the nuts and bolts of how groups of people get things done and create value. Working as a management consultant forced me to produce high quality material in record time and to identify the common problems faced by companies across industries. Now, as a coach, I am able to see the specific challenges faced by individuals in taking control of their work and enjoying the life and the career that they truly want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a coach, I focus on highly personalized, results-based coaching to help my clients take the knowledge that I share on this blog and turn it into effective action. As Tony Robbins says, “Knowledge isn’t power. Knowledge is &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; power.” Nothing brings me greater joy than to see someone learn a new concept, apply it in their life, and enjoy exactly the results they were hoping for. Working as a coach gives me amble opportunity for exactly that, and I bring back to this blog the insights about what works and what doesn’t to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any particular topics you’d like to hear about, please let me know. Your input on what is interesting and valuable is the lifeblood this blog runs on. The more ideas I get from readers, the better for all of us, as it increases intellectual diversity and the chances of making connections between seemingly far-flung topics. Your feedback is extremely welcome - as a mentor of mine likes to say, “feedback is a gift.” I hope that you find something to enjoy here, but even more importantly, I hope that you take what you read and put it into action to take your career and your life in the direction you want to go. Thanks very much for stopping by and I look forward to getting to know you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-10-03-d100-d-from-princess-mononoke/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/34/0e/f0/340ef0748c5918937e4b1dd0fd0fb0fe.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/34/0e/f0/340ef0748c5918937e4b1dd0fd0fb0fe.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this one isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard, since you could pretty much just run Mononoke as a D&amp;amp;D game, but I was watching Mononoke and taking notes on gods/spirits/demons anyway, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and slap this bad boy together. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-09-19-by-our-powers-combined-fellhold-has/ -&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to announce that the Fellhold project now has an official artist! The talented and gracious Eric Koch has signed on as the better half of this DIY monstrosity. You can check out his stuff here at his &lt;a href=&#34;http://lexiconmegatherium.tumblr.com/tagged/erickochart&#34;&gt;tumblr.&lt;/a&gt; So far he has been a joy to work with, and while I plan on greedily hogging all of his RPG-related art time for the next year or so, if after that you&amp;rsquo;re in need of pictures, I highly recommend him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on concept work, making sure we&amp;rsquo;re on the same page with what some of the weirder stuff in Fellhold looks like. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had someone else produce a piece of work for something that has heretofore only been in your head or words on a screen, let me tell you that it is electrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of my words, let&amp;rsquo;s get to the good part: some of Eric&amp;rsquo;s concepts. First off, we have some crabmen, who are close to their final look, the first a fighter, and the second a wealthy merchant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Eric&amp;rsquo;s starting to take on some demon concepts (hinted at by that fella in the arch above). In other words, lots more exciting things to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;m still cracking away at the words and tables parts, more of that coming to the blog soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it.

Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt an especially strong pull to attend Gen Con - my only gaming conventions are one time at Games Day in Baltimore when I was a young lad, and once at North Texas RPG Con last year. Nothing against gaming conventions, it&amp;rsquo;s just that when I&amp;rsquo;m divvying up limited time and money between say, a vacation with my wife, friends&amp;rsquo; weddings, and going to play games with strangers, the cons end up at the bottom of the pile. I can play games with strangers any time online!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f2/90/44/f29044336fbec676ce597ddca1f2f385.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f2/90/44/f29044336fbec676ce597ddca1f2f385.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, next year, apparently there&amp;rsquo;s going to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2016/08/take-rubies-from-demons-eyes.html&#34;&gt;one hell of a DIY D&amp;amp;D party.&lt;/a&gt; This is something I&amp;rsquo;m seriously tempted to make plans to attend. And as part of the build up, Zak points out that here in the DIY-o-sphere, we have a tremendous surplus of talent. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim any share of that, but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna keep putting out the best stuff I can that gets me excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/88/fc/cd/88fccd093a4b4b52f4860e849be554de.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/88/fc/cd/88fccd093a4b4b52f4860e849be554de.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I could use some help. Fellhold needs art. I would do it myself, but I&amp;rsquo;m probably about 5-10 years of full time practice (minimum) away from making art that comes anywhere near my vision for the material. Are you an artist? Do you know any artists? I want to pay a good rate for quality art, and I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to collaborate creatively. Let me know if you or someone you know might be interested in bringing the vision of Fellhold to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6f/a4/a3/6fa4a39d5d3e09f6334170ae52a10808.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6f/a4/a3/6fa4a39d5d3e09f6334170ae52a10808.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Fellhold reboot recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had an unofficial policy to avoid reading too much &amp;ldquo;reference material&amp;rdquo; in the form of other RPG supplements. This is for a couple of reasons. First off, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/search/label/Red%20Hand%20of%20Extra%20Ranks%20In%20Taxidermy&#34;&gt;Zak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/08/lets-read-something-depressing.html&#34;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/12/why-caverns-of-thracia-is-best.html&#34;&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/03/this-is-why-ruins-of-undermountain-is.html&#34;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2015/08/i-dared-enter-ghost-tower-and-all-i-got.html&#34;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/search/label/I%20think%20Expedition%20to%20the%20Ruins%20of%20Greyhawk%20hates%20me&#34;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of what&amp;rsquo;s been put out for as &amp;ldquo;Official D&amp;amp;D stuff&amp;rdquo; over the years has not been great, so why do I want to read mediocre stuff if I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make great stuff? Secondly, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; into imitating stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen elsewhere, or read something I like and copy it and miss the amazing idea I might have had on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to hold off when I hear about a book that might do something I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. So, if a cyberpunk city supplement sounds appealing, instead of reading it and mining it for ideas, I try to think about what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be in there or what I would put in there - and then I can just make that stuff up for Fellhold. Later on I can go back and compare the thing I made with the source that gave me the idea, and see if I missed anything or if their way was totally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, though, the idea of &lt;em&gt;Uncaged: Faces of Sigil&lt;/em&gt; just kept creeping into my brain, causing an itch I finally had to scratch. So, over the weekend I gave it a read, and it was basically what I expected (in both the good and bad sense). I probably would have been better off with reading the thumbnail synopsis and then making my own version of it, like I described above, but like I said, I had an itch and I decided to scratch it. Since I gave in and scratched that itch, though, I figured I should do something useful with it, and instead of just telling you what I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; change, I&amp;rsquo;m actually reworking it into something useful (coming up in Part II). Enjoy and let me know what you think!  **   **  &lt;a href=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAmpUTvK7cY/VwMF60cFEZI/AAAAAAAAGfE/PvUdkic_tjw2H2Dmb7e8n-A6VkGxn3j6A/s1600/underparlakk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAmpUTvK7cY/VwMF60cFEZI/AAAAAAAAGfE/PvUdkic_tjw2H2Dmb7e8n-A6VkGxn3j6A/s320/underparlakk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;The Good&lt;/strong&gt;  First off, the basic idea of what the book is/is for is &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of NPCs that are &amp;ldquo;ready to go&amp;rdquo; when a GM needs them. Each is meant to be useful on their own, but they also have various relationships with each other. For an urban campaign, NPCs are where the game is, so having interesting, ready to go NPCs is just as (if not more) important as having a monster manual. I think the reason we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen more of this is because making up interesting/useful people is usually easier than thinking up interesting/useful monsters. Our entire brain is wired to care about other people and their interactions, so we have a lot to fall back on when it comes both to making up people and interacting with them. Making monsters that are fun and interesting when you interact with them in fictional, abstract combat, though, that&amp;rsquo;s tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, getting &lt;em&gt;good, interesting&lt;/em&gt; NPCs handed to you does essentially the same work that good, interesting published monsters do: it saves the GM work and breaks up the &amp;ldquo;samey-ness&amp;rdquo; that might happen when they make everything up themselves. Especially in a kooky place like Sigil, getting help with the NPCs is a fantastic idea. And the book does a good job of not just giving you a bunch of humans, elves, dwarves, and other standard types that you could find just anywhere. It takes full advantage of the &lt;em&gt;plane&lt;/em&gt; part of Planescape, giving you ogre mages and Genasi and fiends and modrons and sentient plants and more. Another place where the characters shine is that it takes full advantage of all of the levers available with alignment, faction, and personal motivations. There are good characters working with evil characters because they share common ends, there are folks who share a faction but have totally different reasons for working for them, and there are evil characters that can quite likely be useful to the PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and how have I gotten this far without mentioning the art? Every single character gets a gorgeous large-size illustration by Tony Diterlizzi (well, the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; ones - there&amp;rsquo;s a handful at the back with less detail, more on that soon). My favorite one is Zadara the titan. Besides being nice for all the reasons that illustrations in RPG books are always nice, for a book of characters, the illustrations are damn near essential. They make each character more concrete and gives the GM a way to differentiate them. Instead of lengthy description, they can just turn the book to the players and go &amp;ldquo;they look like this&amp;rdquo;. Now, they could have done more to make the illustrations &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; rather than just pretty, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the appendix at the end of the book, there’s a handful of less detailed NPCs that get about a paragraph or two of description, and no detailed workup of powers/combat abilities and so forth. Then you get a half dozen “quick ideas”, which give a name, a bare minimum stat line (race, gender, hit dice, class, level, faction, alignment), and then two sentences or so of characterization. Honestly, these are some of my favorite characters and some of my favorite writing in the book. A booklet of 50-100 interesting, evocative NPCs in this format with a little thumbnail mugshot? That would be &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OAZTg-NXCBo/UhvL50yUx7I/AAAAAAAAAT8/FQZ7sBa9Wks/s1600/Tiefling-Kylie.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OAZTg-NXCBo/UhvL50yUx7I/AAAAAAAAAT8/FQZ7sBa9Wks/s1600/Tiefling-Kylie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of layout and information architecture, there&amp;rsquo;s a few high points, but unfortunately, most of what I have to say will be in the next section. As for the good stuff, though, I almost overlooked the table of contents, which gives a little one sentence description of who/what this character is and why you might want to reference them. They&amp;rsquo;re terse and evocative and useful, which is great. The introduction explains the point of the book and how to use the characters presented, and it’s a pretty useful orientation. Within the write-ups themselves, each character has a summary that takes up about a quarter of a page, and in typical late 2E fashion focuses mainly on describing special powers and combat info, but there are some tips on how to roleplay and where to find them. The best part of the summary, though, is the “See Also” section. This little blurb tells you the other NPCs from the book that are especially connected to this NPC and mentioned in their write up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole book, my favorite piece of information architecture is at the back in the “Ties That Bind” appendix. This brief section provides a list of which NPCs run establishments and what sort it is, which NPCs provide services (and what they are) and little diagrams that show the various intrigues, with a summary of what the intrigue is about. Besides the specific plots, there is also a diagram of “Bigwigs with Jink” which shows the three especially rich/influential people presented in the book, who are their allies and who they oppose. This whole section neatly summarizes the interesting and gameable stuff throughout the book, and it is very much appreciated. There’s also a little section on locations mentioned in the book organized by Ward, with a brief mention of it’s relevance (so and so lives here, this guy runs it, et cetera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, remember back in the “&lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/Let%27s%20Talk%20About%20Campaign%20Settings&#34;&gt;Let’s Talk About Campaign Settings&lt;/a&gt;” post on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2015/06/lets-talk-about-campaign-settings-ii.html&#34;&gt;second edition settings&lt;/a&gt; where we talked about padding? Yeah. That. This book is an &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; in padding. A disertation on padding. The platonic ideal of padding. Okay, I exaggerate, obviously, but the padding is strong with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, where I said that you don’t need to waste time on a lengthy description if you have a good picture? They do that anyway. You get long backstories and detailed descriptions of stuff that could be usefully (and more interestingly) summarized. There was even a “bait and switch” moment I experienced when reading the introduction. First we get this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Each entry in this *&lt;em&gt;volume includes the same basic information&lt;/em&gt; about a Character: personal history, physical appearance, goals, personality, occupation or activities, favorite *hangouts in Sigil, and potential connections or utility to &lt;em&gt;the player characters.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  And I’m thinking “wow, those are some good headers for NPC entires, if each entry is organized with those, you’ll get plenty of info and it’ll be easy to reference!” Then I read the next sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**But you won&amp;rsquo;t find these topics set *apart and labeled within the body of the text. Each entry is &lt;em&gt;meant to be read as a narrative&lt;/em&gt; *- * one that tells you everything *you need to know about a character without reducing &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;him,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;her,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;it to a list of facts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  But, but, but an NPC &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a list of facts - that’s what’s useful to the GM. They don’t become a character until those facts are acted out or described by a person. I actually laughed out loud when I read this because it so &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; embodies the late 90’s RPG writing ethos that is now so thoroughly rejected by the DIY D&amp;amp;D crowd. Later on there’s a nod to the fact that that’s not a useful format for GMs in the heat of play, so that’s why they have the “Quick Chant” summary sections mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with the “Quick Chant” sections is that they display mid to late 2E’s typical obsession with combat stats, special powers, and statting everything by PC rules - an obsession that would later find its full flowering in third edition. Now, don’t get me wrong - if you are using all those powers and they are relevant to your game, I’m sure they’re useful to have called out and summarized, but they’re kind of weirdly intermixed with the roleplaying info in the summary. In order, you get a detailed statline, a description of all special abilities (and every character has several), then you get three or four words to summarize their personality, then special equipment, then spells, then spell-like abilities, then the location you can find them, then notes on roleplaying them, then notes on running them in combat, and finally the “see also” we mentioned earlier. Does that order make much sense to you? Cos it doesn’t to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of combat and special powers - almost all of the characters listed in here are powerful, classed figures. And the descriptions of them often specifically indicate that they use their high level powers to stop people from screwing up the status quo. Want to steal something from that shop? Too bad, she’s got crazy golems made out of the wares. Try to fight the nice gnomish bookstore owner? He’ll wreck your whole day with crazy illusions and his demon paladin friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such shenanigans could be handled well if they gave a feeling of “wow, Sigil’s a crazy place where you would need ingenious ways to stay on top of things!&amp;rdquo; Instead, almost all of these kinds of examples feel painfully specifically like “if the players try to fuck with this person or place, here’s how you shut them down.” It’s gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are one or two people who are special or influential despite being 0-level normal folks, but the correlation is usually important = good at fightings. Another typical 2E-ism is that there’s a lot of powerful “good guy” NPCs that are probably intended to be DM-stand-in allies for the PCs, which is kind of boring. One of these powerful good guys runs a day spa. The entry goes on at great length about the services available there (manicures, pedicures, acupuncture, full body massage, facials, you get the drift) and how amazing they are. Somebody contributing to this was way into spas. Don’t get me wrong - spas can be good stuff for RPGs, check out Arnold’s adventure &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/07/take-bath-you-damn-dirty-murder-hobo.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; indication of why the PCs might care. There’s no intrigue happening there, the spa doesn’t grant you any bonuses or remove any conditions, it reads as if it’s simply a place to encourage “good roleplaying” of the late 90’s sort - describe stuff about your character &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it isn’t rules-relevant, or you’re not really roleplaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess I got a bit worked up about spas too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to some of the issues here. I mentioned before that the book includes several intrigues or plots that various NPCs are involved in, which is good. What is less good is that the intrigues are a bit boring and are lacking any serious “so what?” for the players. The main intrigue involves an angel (excuse me, “deva”) running upper planar weapons to the Blood War between demons and devils (ahem, between the Baatezu and Tanar’ri). The angel figures all the fiends will wipe each other out and stick to their own turf if they don’t have to go get weapons elsewhere. Some evil people involved think that the weapons will keep the war going, which they want for their own evil reasons. And some people just want to make a bunch of cash running the weapons across the planes. That’s it - that’s the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It assumes that the players will care about the blood war because they’re heroes and fiends are bad, right? Another typical 2E-ism. Or, even worse, it perhaps assumes that the GM will present clues to a thing, and the players will investigate because that’s the adventure that was prepared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me awhile to realize something reading this book, but it was thinking about this plot where I realized something was ringing false. The book sounds like a very sandboxy kind of tool - a grab bag of NPCs to be used as needed as the PCs run around a big, complex city. Having grown used to the modern DIY D&amp;amp;D mindset, I assumed it really was just such a sandboxy tool, since it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a specific &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo;, where I would have been on guard for railroady bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the book, though, it clicked that this was written by people caught in the grip of an age of pre-planned storyline adventures. Even if the intent was for the characters to be used in a sandboxy way, the plots they pursue all feel just a bit too “complete” - like &amp;ldquo;this is the story this person is a character in, no others!&amp;rdquo; Each PC has &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; specific goals, actions, and interactions spelled out, and the connections between the NPCs are very tight. This makes the NPCs less modular, which is a shame. Any one character kind of &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; all the other ones they&amp;rsquo;re involved with to do anything more interesting than provide a good or service. In other words, when you bring one of these NPCs in as written, you&amp;rsquo;re committing to a particular storyline adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say, to the writers&amp;rsquo;/editors&amp;rsquo; credit, none of these plots have a specific outcome defined, so maybe I should say a &lt;em&gt;pseudo&lt;/em&gt;-storyline type adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mysidia.org/Planescape/OldDM/tsr02624%20-%20Uncaged%20-%20Faces%20of%20Sigil00021.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mysidia.org/Planescape/OldDM/tsr02624%20-%20Uncaged%20-%20Faces%20of%20Sigil00021.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough ranting about what is lacking in the intrigues, I think you get the idea. Let’s talk about the writing a bit. As mentioned before, it’s quite wordy, and every entry would benefit tremendously from being maybe one quarter the length (which, coming from me is a bit rich, I know). The entries are also presented in a variety of “voices” - sometimes a personal narrative, sometimes an interview, sometimes the typical disembodied all knowing sage of monstrous manual tradition. If this had been done well, it might have been interesting, but instead it just felt kind of grating to me. Your tastes may vary on this obviously, but it felt a little to me like “ooh, look how creative we’re being!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of NPCs and their write ups was also variable, which I presume is a remnant of the fact that they came from multiple sources (several appeared first in &lt;em&gt;Dragon,&lt;/em&gt; some in adventures, - the original sources are included at the back of the book. No authors are listed in the credits, just an editor. Presumably the “special thanks” section includes the authors). On the plus side, the Planescape cant isn’t too strong - I’m a fan of it when used sparingly, and this one gets it about right. There’s a bit of fun at their own expense - a rogue modron presented in the book uses too much cant and uses it wrong. Unfortunately, some of the humor is fairly “hurr, hurr, see what I did there, guys?” - such as a character in conversation “forgetting” that the realms are on Toril, not Krynn (Get it, you guys? &lt;em&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/em&gt;, you guys. You guys.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of published campaign settings, I felt like they were referenced too often when talking about the prime material plane. I assume this was TSR trying to push the “interoperability” of Planescape with the other campaign settings, but it just made the prime feel smaller - you keep referencing the same three planets when there’s supposed to be an infinite number out there? Weak sauce. Another way that some of TSR’s questionable business drivers crept into the book is that you get a few wiffs of loathsome metaplot. Some of the entries reference the build up to the forthcoming faction war. I know this sort of stuff was all the rage back then, but I hated it even as a kid, and I hate it even more now. Bleh, keep your stories out of my campaign setting, we’ll make our own, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entries are basically in alphabetical order, but because some characters have last names and others don&amp;rsquo;t, the fact that characters are ordered by their last names if they have one made it somewhat non-obvious, and I imagine it would make flipping through difficult. As I said when talking about the introduction, I would have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; for each NPC to have the sections they detailed as actual headers, or at a minimum, have a little thumbnail that describes that stuff along with the six pages of so-so prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the art! The art was beautiful and large, which is appreciated, but more could have been done, oh yes, much more! Little thumbnails of the character’s faces in the table of contents, some kind of icon for the different plots, more diagrams of how characters are related to each other right there in their entires. Reprints of the art in another section without text so you can show players without giving stuff away. More of it bigger, because you didn&amp;rsquo;t waste space on thousands of words. Basically it was presented as nothing more than decoration, when it could have also been treated as a game aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itsmygamemyrules.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/shator-xideous_by_tony_diterlizzi-2624_1996-03_tsr_add_2ed_planescape_-_uncaged_-_faces_of_sigil.jpg?w=1200&#34;&gt;https://itsmygamemyrules.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/shator-xideous_by_tony_diterlizzi-2624_1996-03_tsr_add_2ed_planescape_-_uncaged_-_faces_of_sigil.jpg?w=1200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m Gonna Do About It&lt;/strong&gt;  Okay, enough grousing: since I went to the trouble of reading all of and thinking about what it could have been, hell, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been - let&amp;rsquo;s just totally go there.  Here’s what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking:       - Create headings for the essential stuff and organize the content below them       - Summarize the good stuff, cut out the bad, lightly edit        - Make little face thumbnails for everybody and include them anywhere that character is referenced       - Tweak the plots to be more open ended, with more hooks for self-interested PCs       - Create icons for each plot and include them whenever that plot is referenced       - Make &amp;ldquo;no words&amp;rdquo; pictures to show the players - &amp;ldquo;They look like this&amp;rdquo;       - Re-organize the order based on the first word of the name       - Make better diagrams of relationships and include them with each entry (with the thumbnails from above)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post the results in part II, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of culling involved, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how long it&amp;rsquo;ll take. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the DIY scene has produced tons of great &lt;a href=&#34;http://rememberdismove.blogspot.com/2015/11/pub-names.html&#34;&gt;bar/pub and inn generators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/david-mcgrogan/yoon-suin/paperback/product-22070778.html&#34;&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s got Tea Houses, but I&amp;rsquo;m more of a coffee guy myself, and as mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2016/07/fine-dining-carousing-table.html&#34;&gt;previous post about carousing&lt;/a&gt;, I loves me some good food, so I wanted to come up with some generators for other types of social establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lasvegaseventphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fiamma-Restaurant-Interior-Dining.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lasvegaseventphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fiamma-Restaurant-Interior-Dining.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=67&#34;&gt;Vornheim&lt;/a&gt;, Zak gives the excellent advice of always having four bars/taverns/drinking establishments ready to go for a session, because those are the sorts of places PCs are likely to visit and that NPCs are likely to be found. I wanted to branch out and create some places that have different feels. Bars and taverns are where you go to meet new people, inns are places you can stay if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an apartment, restaurants a little more &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo; for when you go carousing, but still have some adventure hooks, and coffee houses are where you go to learn stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.5thaveauctions.co.za/July14/images/zoom_190.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.5thaveauctions.co.za/July14/images/zoom_190.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that any of these can just be a name and some feature that makes it noteworthy, but if the players take an interest in any of them, they can slot right into the overall approach for creating intrigue and adventure hooks. The &amp;ldquo;Known For&amp;rdquo; column is mostly just there to make it memorable and may or may not have any game effect (like an &amp;ldquo;appearance&amp;rdquo; column in an NPC generator), whereas the &amp;ldquo;Spice&amp;rdquo; column is meant to be more directly gameable (some source of conflict or desires that PCs can get mixed up in). As with previous Fellhold generator, the hassled ref can proceed left to right and only use the columns they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I present the Restaurant and Coffee House Generators I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared for Fellhold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54aa1a25e4b0d6033e4fca44/54af4ab7e4b06fead268e9db/5546efbae4b0528c14ba7dd1/1465881793284/leitz-starbucks-roy.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54aa1a25e4b0d6033e4fca44/54af4ab7e4b06fead268e9db/5546efbae4b0528c14ba7dd1/1465881793284/leitz-starbucks-roy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee House Generator&lt;/strong&gt;  Coffee Houses are a major part of Fellhold social life, serving as the main meeting place of intellectuals, radicals, and socialites alike. While various varieties of regular coffee are the main beverage served, some houses specialize in more powerful brews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant Generator&lt;/strong&gt;  The people of Fellhold enjoy a variety of dining options and regularly patronize a large number of restaurants. Each race is known for their own ethnic foods, but most people enjoy most other types of food.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why I&#39;ve Been Quiet on Google&#43;</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-19-why-ive-been-quiet-on-google/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 09:28:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-19-why-ive-been-quiet-on-google/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-19-why-ive-been-quiet-on-google/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dd/92/c9/dd92c9943990ac21774447afbc6e5d7e.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dd/92/c9/dd92c9943990ac21774447afbc6e5d7e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this quick post, we&amp;rsquo;ll get back to the real gaming content. I just wanted to post this somewhere that I could link to it and anyone interested could find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - Trying to get a hold of me on G+ probably won&amp;rsquo;t work, email me if you want to talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have me in your circles in Google Plus, you may have noticed that over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather quiet. You might even have tagged me into something and I never responded. If so, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sorry! The short version for why I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled back from social media is that I read this book: &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1468944230&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=deep+work&#34;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1468944230&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=deep+work&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HsuPnTbrL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic, by the way. I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying the advice in it not only to work but also to working on RPG material, and that&amp;rsquo;s why you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the resurgence of Fellhold posts here the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one of the things it recommends is to be more selective with what online tools you engage with, especially social media. It&amp;rsquo;s custom tailored content that is personally addressed to you, doled out in unpredictable intervals - that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the textbook method of operant conditioning to get people to constantly pay attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Google Plus is probably the least worst of these sites, especially when it comes to Old School-ish/DIY RPG discussion - there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of great, high-value discussions and collaborations going on there. And if you&amp;rsquo;re in my circles talking about that stuff, I love you guys (and gals). But I found myself doing nothing RPG-related but talking on Google Plus, and I realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made the decision to turn off all my Google Plus notifications and stop checking the site. I&amp;rsquo;m still using it to share when I post new blog posts, because I know not everyone has the same approach as me. But for the next little while, blogs and published books are going to be the hobby stuff that I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk games, hit up my email through my G+ profile, or leave a comment on a blog post. If you want to have a discussion with lots of people, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to jump into specific G+ threads - I mostly just want to avoid the constant checking for what&amp;rsquo;s new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading my stuff, one of the points of this approach is to force myself to think harder about my game thoughts, rather than firing off the first thing to pop into my head in a G+ post. That means writing it out in blog posts and putting them here. So, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fine Dining Carousing Table</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-11-fine-dining-carousing-table/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151104103018-asia-instagram-chefs-lennardy3-super-169.jpeg&#34;&gt;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151104103018-asia-instagram-chefs-lennardy3-super-169.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I enjoy the most about living in a big city, and look forward to the most when visiting another city, is the food. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;d say most of my enjoyment of a vacation comes down to how good the food I get to eat on it is. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of going somewhere beautiful or culturally important if you&amp;rsquo;re eating bland crap while you&amp;rsquo;re there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zagat.com/proxy/v1.4?m=image&amp;amp;a=resize&amp;amp;url=https%3A//storage.googleapis.com/zgt-user/LK_Alstadt_edit.JPG&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=360&amp;amp;key=abbc09b7c840c10937a4db331422c98b&#34;&gt;https://www.zagat.com/proxy/v1.4?m=image&amp;amp;a=resize&amp;amp;url=https%3A//storage.googleapis.com/zgt-user/LK_Alstadt_edit.JPG&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=360&amp;amp;key=abbc09b7c840c10937a4db331422c98b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, an important aspect of getting Fellhold to feel like a city is to make food matter. When it comes to dungeon crawling or traditional exploration, I like approaches like &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2015/05/dungeon-viddles-hms-apollyon-players.html&#34;&gt;Gus&amp;rsquo;s on the HMS Apollyon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/03/narrative-wounds-and-fast-hp-refreshment.html&#34;&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;where you link eating rations to recovery of HP or exhaustion - it makes intuitive sense, and it ties food into something that players already deeply care about, and does so in a way that meshes with the core rhythm of the game (exploration rounds, fights, et cetera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8180534579_3e7dc6615f.jpg&#34;&gt;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8180534579_3e7dc6615f.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I see a bit of a gap in these excellent rules, though, is in linking food with the experience of living in a place (Gus has some mention of food in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2014/07/hms-appolyon-living-costs-and-basic.html&#34;&gt;living cost rules here&lt;/a&gt; which I had totally forgotten about when I wrote my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2016/06/lifestyles-of-poor-and-adventurous.html&#34;&gt;own lifestyle rules&lt;/a&gt;). I tried to work in some mention of food in those lifestyle rules, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t provide much flavor (pun definitely intended). And then I had a wonderful realization: carousing tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://images2.phoenixnewtimes.com/imager/u/original/6540779/monti_carlo_wine_kegs.jpg&#34;&gt;http://images2.phoenixnewtimes.com/imager/u/original/6540779/monti_carlo_wine_kegs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I had already come up with the idea of having several different carousing tables for players to choose from, with different costs and effects.  As I started building them out, I realized they are a great way to convey &amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo; about the city without boring exposition or description. And I decided that going out and eating well ought to be one of the ways you can carouse. So I present to you the Fine Dining carousing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/71/6f/b1/716fb1a8f6c4086595f3890a9b8b0589.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/71/6f/b1/716fb1a8f6c4086595f3890a9b8b0589.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Rules note: it works like standard carousing rules - players commit to carouse before they roll the cost, they make some kind of test to see if they have to roll on the mishap table, and they gain XP equal to the cost regardless. The mishap table is full of wacky shenanigans and adventure hooks.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-08-conspiracy-generator-for-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2782/5805833979_8c7b781b53_o.jpg&#34;&gt;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2782/5805833979_8c7b781b53_o.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty skeptical of myself when I set out to write this section. Initially, I just planned on including some guidance that basically said &amp;ldquo;go read the section of &lt;em&gt;Night&amp;rsquo;s Black Agents&lt;/em&gt; about conspiracies and make something up for your city. But with all of the other generators I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing, it just seemed to go against the ethos I&amp;rsquo;ve been following of &amp;ldquo;make tools that people can use or ignore as they like&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was at a bit of a loss on how conspiracies fit into my conception of Fellhold: it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty anarchic place with no real government and where fairly awful people and things openly do their business - so why would a group with a crackpot idea be a conspiracy and not just a faction? But then I realized there&amp;rsquo;s always somebody who would find secrecy useful, and that spurred me on to think of a number of different reasons the conspiracy might want to stay secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ended up with a few tables I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with. I think that many of the results are easily adaptable outside of Fellhold, and if nothing else the column headers provide a pretty good blue print for what you need to define for a conspiracy. And the name generator is gleefully abstract and obtuse, so I think it should work in just about any setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://67.media.tumblr.com/d1ffd0f0ff3601882bd986adea7075ad/tumblr_mgw1eyQQa41qg8i80o7_r1_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;http://67.media.tumblr.com/d1ffd0f0ff3601882bd986adea7075ad/tumblr_mgw1eyQQa41qg8i80o7_r1_1280.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspiracies&lt;/strong&gt;  With all the demons, undead, ratmen, and factional conniving going on, Fellhold has several conspiracies. A conspiracy is any group of people (and/or monsters) pursuing its goals in secret. Where the power structure, overall goals, and membership in factions is generally open knowledge, conspiracies are purposely hidden. They may be entirely undertaken by members of a faction, such as pursuing that faction’s secret goals or plotting a coup, or they may be unrelated to the normal factional power structure, such as a secret cult to the dead gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players cannot choose to target conspiracies with the investigate urbancrawl action until they have some way of knowing that the conspiracy exists. Once they have encountered NPCs or clues that suggest the existence of some kind of conspiracy, they can begin to investigate it. Ask players the methods they are using and the kind of information they’re seeking, but investigating conspiracies will usually reveal either someone connected to a known conspirator (use the rules for contacts to create, with any tweaks to fit the conspiracy), the structure of the conspiracy (e.g. “Well, if this guy is an assassin, he has to have someone paying him, and there’d usually be a go-between as well”), or clues to its general purpose or aim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that conspiracies can hire PCs just as readily as any other NPC or organization, so the “short term plots” column of the table below can double as an additional job generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the other levels of intrigue going on in Fellhold (districts, factions, et cetera), it is recommended that you begin with somewhere between zero and two conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://killsixbilliondemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ksbd33.jpg&#34;&gt;http://killsixbilliondemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ksbd33.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating a Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt;  While conspiracies provide an excellent opportunity for a truly customized piece of the city that receives loving and detailed attention from the referee, sometimes we do not have that luxury. As such, the below tables and guidance are provided for generating a conspiracy. Even more so than the NPC, location, and district tables, you are encouraged to use this section as a starting point and source of inspiration, rather than “the whole answer”. The results in the table are necessarily open-ended and flexible so that they can fit a wide variety of combinations and tie into other material you have generated elsewhere, such as factions, major NPCs, and districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracy Traits&lt;/em&gt;  Use the following table to generate the basic traits for your conspiracy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;District  &amp;amp; Faction Relationships&lt;/em&gt;  As with NPCs and Factions, conspiracies should be placed somewhere on the map. While it is possible that they will have multiple bases, at a minimum their leader should have a specific place. The placement of these bases will both depend on and help to clarify the nature of the conspiracy. Somewhere between D3 and D6 bases are recommended, as these locations provide another possible avenue for discovery by players in addition to rumors and contacts. Treat them as places of interest for the districts that contain them, and they may be discovered in the same way as other places of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the results of the above table, various Faction relationships will be important to identify as well. Some conspiracies operate entirely within the bounds of one faction, acting against its “legitimate” interests, while others are faction agnostic and will take members from any faction. Additionally, many results in the above table point towards factions, and these will need to be determined. As with districts, these may be obvious from other traits, or they may help to clarify the nature of the conspiracy if randomly generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thealexandrian.net/images/20150126d.jpg&#34;&gt;http://www.thealexandrian.net/images/20150126d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracy Structure&lt;/em&gt;  Every conspiracy has a structure of control and secrecy. It may be organized into cells where only one member knows and is known by the next level up, or it may be a very traditional hierarchical pyramid. Where relationship maps are recommended for NPCs in general, for a conspiracy they are essential. You do not have to generate the NPCs for the entire conspiracy immediately, but you should at least know how many leaders there are, what the lines of reporting to them are, and who supplies money or weapons to the front line agents of the conspiracy. In play, players might be able to figure out the structure before they identify individuals, which will help direct them in where to investigate more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further help with the structure side of things, I encourage you to check out Kenneth Hite’s excellent treatment of conspiracies in &lt;em&gt;Night’s Black Agents&lt;/em&gt; and especially the “conspyramid” therein. Also helpful are the series of posts on &lt;em&gt;Node Based Adventure Design&lt;/em&gt; on the Alexandrian blog, as well as real world information on social network analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://phictures.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/8555434483_bb00f27bdb_o.jpg&#34;&gt;http://phictures.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/8555434483_bb00f27bdb_o.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracy Rumor Tables&lt;/em&gt;  Rumor tables provide the chance for player characters to be randomly exposed to the potential existence of conspiracies. They should be contradictory and have more misinformation than most rumor tables, but should have enough nuggets of truth that players can begin to investigate. Unlike rumors about a dungeon, where the information is primarily a resource to help in making more informed decisions, for a conspiracy, investigating the truth or falsity of the rumors &lt;em&gt;is the adventure,&lt;/em&gt; so it’s okay to have wackier rumors, so long as they do not point the players towards totally useless avenues of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since conspiracy rumors are less likely to come up than others and their primary purpose is to get players onto the scent, shorter tables than other types of rumors are probably sufficient. The sample conspiracies provided have d8 rumors each, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is provided a “fill in the blank” table of rumors that can be used with the table of characteristics above as a starting point. It will not produce especially interesting rumors on its own, but should do in a pinch and can serve as a starting point for crafting more specific rumors. It is meant to provide a mix of true and mistaken information, so where it notes “random”, roll again on the conspiracy traits table. If it does not say “random”, use the information you generated for the conspiracy. You may decide the truth or falsity of any rumors so generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracy Name&lt;/em&gt;  After you have generated the details and relationships for the conspiracy, you will need a suitably grandiose or radical name. If at a loss, the following should be generic enough to apply to almost any sort of conspiracy, but more specific and descriptive names may be more fun if you can think of them, such as “The Esoteric Order for the Restoration of Dwarven Greatness” or some such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the table below, start with “The”, and if desired, insert some sort of organizational term (“order of”, “band”, “guild”, and so forth) where it fits, and elaborate with any further words that describe the conspiracy (or don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-07-05-vendors-and-merchants-of-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://img02.deviantart.net/e961/i/2013/326/d/a/the_enchanted_trinkets_shop_by_shutupandwhisper-d6v841n.jpg&#34;&gt;http://img02.deviantart.net/e961/i/2013/326/d/a/the_enchanted_trinkets_shop_by_shutupandwhisper-d6v841n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have another of the specialist NPC types in Fellhold, like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2016/06/sages-and-their-petty-rivalries-in.html&#34;&gt;Sages&lt;/a&gt; previously presented. Also like the sages, a big, big inspiration for them was Noism/David McGrogan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2015/04/there-is-therefore-strange-land-concept.html&#34;&gt;treatment of fences here&lt;/a&gt;. The goal with merchants is twofold: first off, I want to make the people who sell PCs the stuff they frequently buy potentially interesting, and secondly to be contacts in the world of business, providing their own jobs and intrigue and social connections with a different flavor than sages, patrons, or fences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to merchant-flavored variations of the standard NPC stuff (look, demeanor, &amp;ldquo;spice&amp;rdquo;), I also added the slightly more nuts and bolts columns of Pricing, Selection, and Quality to this generator. The hope here is that there will be reason to travel across town to the expensive armorer, since they have stuff you just can&amp;rsquo;t get from your neighborhood guy, but you&amp;rsquo;ll also put up with lower quality stuff from this other fella because you like doing business with that guy who gave you a no-interest loan to keep your apartment. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m putting too much faith in PC behavior, but it&amp;rsquo;s another level of potentially interesting detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve created for Fellhold so far, the goal has been to provide the pieces for emergent complexity (and hopefully interest). In other words, knowing that this one merchant is cheap but high quality is not that interesting by itself, but when he&amp;rsquo;s randomly placed in a district controlled by a faction the players pissed off, and he&amp;rsquo;s also involved in an intrigue they found out about through a contact of theirs, you start to get some interesting implications and plenty of fodder for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I apologize for the even-uglier-than-usual table today, once I get around to actually making this a real thing, the layout will be much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/da/15/da/da15da682fff8a00d08b5583dff0a472.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/da/15/da/da15da682fff8a00d08b5583dff0a472.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merchants&lt;/strong&gt;  Merchants conduct business, usually buying and selling a particular good or service, but occasionally branching out into more general business. They might be modest shop keepers or lords of mercantile empires. Their main significance to the PCs is as sources of tools and equipment. Unlike Fences, Merchants will predominantly be interested in selling things to the PCs, but may occasionally need help acquiring rare components, dealing with rivals, or be willing to buy specialist gear or materials. Note that it is not necessary or desirable to generate a merchant for every business transaction the PCs conduct, but in the case of either rare/difficult to find goods, or those the PCs are likely to buy over and over again, they may be desirable. As usual, any subset of this table that is useful in the moment may be used rather than the entire thing (for example, you may only care about pricing, selection, and quality). Roll on the table below to generate - gender may be decided by looking at the die rolled for race (or any other) - odd indicates male, even female.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-06-28-books-and-libraries-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3052/5806314312_8b83b650c4_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3052/5806314312_8b83b650c4_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the current draft of the rules for libraries and books in Fellhold. If you want to skip straight to the best stuff, scroll down to the table for generating random pretentious book titles - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it&amp;rsquo;s turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want libraries and books to play an important role in Fellhold. Since urban games are largely about information, and dungeon games are largely about exploration, having lots of opportunities to explore spaces in search of information seemed like a perfect fit. Also, with all the demons running around, books with Demon names have got to be really valuable (I need to more directly incorporate that element into the rules, but first I have to figure out the demon rules). Also, the tags and book format sections could probably use some expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules might still be a bit chunky, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to playtest them some. Zak&amp;rsquo;s library rules in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=67&#34;&gt;Vornheim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are an obvious and direct influence here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also read some great stuff on books over the years, including Ben L&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2014/01/textual-corruptions-and-ritual-disasters.html&#34;&gt;post on textual corruptions&lt;/a&gt; (some ideas from which I&amp;rsquo;m going to incorporate into the demon rules). Some conversations with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/&#34;&gt;Logan Knight&lt;/a&gt; have also been influencing my thinking recently, and the alternate resolution approach for quick reference is based on something he told me about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://assets.dwell.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_photo/public/2012/12/02/rewind-illuminated-texts-the-morgan-library-bw.jpg?itok=puxQXbl5&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.dwell.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_photo/public/2012/12/02/rewind-illuminated-texts-the-morgan-library-bw.jpg?itok=puxQXbl5&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Libraries &amp;amp; Books&lt;/strong&gt;  In addition to the two massive rival libraries of Fellhold and their incessant feuding, raids, and counter raids, characters may encounter smaller libraries in rich homes, forgotten delvings, or within specialist guilds. The following rules are for searching those libraries for useful books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Library Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Rating&lt;/em&gt;  A library’s rating takes into account both its size and its quality - an enormous library of middling texts might have a similar rating to a tiny, focused library with the best books on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt;  Tags describe the kinds of books that the library holds. These tags will usually be related to subject matter, but may also have to do with origin or purpose. The referee is invited to create any tags necessary or desired, but for ease, here is a list of sample tags, numbered for use in random generation as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) History  2) Dwarves  3) Undead  4) Magic  5) Runes  6) Demons  7) Money &amp;amp; Business  8) Engineering  9) Botany  10) Zoology  11) Monsters  12) Factions  13) Sorcerers  14) Summoning  15) Legends  16) Physical Fitness  17) Warfare  18) Prophecy  19) Ethnography  20) Games  21) Philosophy  22) Nature  23) Art  25) Law  26) Architecture  27) Fellhold  28) Language  29) Biography  30) Fiction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3d/a6/9e/3da69e4c5b748544a6f6f2d1fb3e9e47.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3d/a6/9e/3da69e4c5b748544a6f6f2d1fb3e9e47.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating a Library&lt;/strong&gt;  If you find yourself in need of generating a library, you may use the following procedure. As always, feel free to either randomly generate or to choose the options that suit you best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size&lt;/em&gt;  1) Tiny  2) Small  3) Medium  4) Large  5) Huge  6) Gargantuan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality&lt;/em&gt;  1) Wretched (-2)  2) Poor (-1)  3) Middling (+0)  4) Decent (+1)  5) Good (+2)  6) Excellent (+3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt;  Roll 1d6 to determine the number of tags. In the case of a 6, roll again and add the new roll to the previous (repeating as long as you get 6s). These may be chosen or randomly determined with the table above.   *   *  &lt;em&gt;Rating&lt;/em&gt;  Rating is calculated by looking at the size, quality, and tags of the library. A library &lt;em&gt;can have a negative rating&lt;/em&gt; - this represents a disorganized mess full of misleading information that seems useful until it is actually read through and thought about.   Size: +1 per size over Medium  Quality: Add or subtract the appropriate value below:  1) Wretched (-2)  2) Poor (-1)  3) Middling (+0)  4) Decent (+1)  5) Good (+2)  6) Excellent (+3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtract 1 for every tag over 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this represents the fact that
the more subjects a library covers, the more likely it is that the included books are unfocused or introductory in nature. You may ignore this modifier if creating an especially well-appointed library (like a faction’s private library or that of an ancient lich).  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Book Format&lt;/em&gt;  Books may take different forms depending on the culture and people who made them. Smaller libraries are more likely to be made up entirely of one or two kind of book, while the largest may have examples of every kind. Assume 1 additional book type for every size over medium, or just decide. Roll or select from below:  1) Bound Books  2) Codices  3) Scrolls  4) Carved Stone Tablets  5) Carved Wooden Rods (read by reading from one end to the other, then rotating, like corn on the cob)  6) Ceramic cones with spiraling marks (Crabman)  7) Tapestries  8) Tattooed skin  *   *    &lt;a href=&#34;http://img01.deviantart.net/12ea/i/2015/049/b/c/spell_components_by_lakehurwitz-d8ika67.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img01.deviantart.net/12ea/i/2015/049/b/c/spell_components_by_lakehurwitz-d8ika67.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  *   *  &lt;strong&gt;Player Character Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;  After raiding enough libraries and acquiring a pile of esoteric books, it’s possible that players will begin to wonder about building their own library.  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Requirements and Starting Characteristics&lt;/em&gt;  Requires its own comfortable or better lifestyle in addition to whatever the player character pays for themself  - Begins at tiny size, wretched quality, and only with the tags of specific books the player owns  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Upgrading Size&lt;/em&gt;  Upgrading size has the following costs (each step must be bought in order):  1) Tiny: -  2) Small: 100 GM x current number of tags  3) Medium: 200 GM x current number of tags  4) Large: 400 GM x current number of tags  5) Huge: 800 GM x current number of tags  6) Gargantuan: 1600 GM x current number of tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upgrading Quality&lt;/em&gt;  1) Wretched: -  2) Poor: 200 GM  3) Middling: 400 GM  4) Decent: 800 GM  5) Good: 1600 GM  6) Excellent: 3200 GM  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Adding Tags&lt;/em&gt;  To add a tag, simply pay the combined value of the base rate for the library’s size and quality. For example, if your library is medium and of middling quality, you would pay 200 GM + 400 GM = 600 GM per tag added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calculating Rating&lt;/em&gt;  Rating is calculated as for randomly generated libraries, except that it is &lt;em&gt;not reduced&lt;/em&gt; by tags over 3. Presumably the player is being judicious in their choices of works and understands their relevance, connections, and where to find them when needed. Therefore, the formula is thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+1 per size category, +/- quality modifier = Rating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a Personal Library&lt;/em&gt;  Rather than defining the individual book that is useful in a given situation, a player may use their own library effectively as “one big book” - this means that they may use the procedures for using a book found below, but act as if they have a book with the rating and tags of their entire current library. This ease of use and flexibility is the chief benefit of going to the expense and trouble constructing your own library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c0/40/9f/c0409f9362163ea861c4e2b2ca22168b.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c0/40/9f/c0409f9362163ea861c4e2b2ca22168b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching a Library&lt;/strong&gt;  There are two types of searching: targeted and browsing. They are somewhat analogous to the distinction between crawling and targeted movement. In the case of targeted searching, the character is looking for a specific title. In the case of browsing, a character is simply looking for anything interesting that the library has. For the sake of simplicity, one character cannot perform both actions at the same time - sure, you would notice different titles than your target while searching for it, but you wouldn’t have the time to pull them out, flip through them, and verify that they’re something of interest. Since the sorting, labeling, and cataloging of books is highly non-standard and occasionally purposefully obfuscated, it is never as simple as going to the appropriate section and going in alphabetical order to the proper author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeted&lt;/em&gt;  There are two relevant questions in targeted searching: does the library have the desired title? How long do you spend searching for it (whether it’s there or not)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of titles that are known to be held in a library, you can skip the first question, unless the source of information was bad or mistaken. To determine how long players spend looking for it, as usual, ask yourself if there is any urgency associated with the search - if not, they just find it if it’s there. If there is some kind of urgency, then the players can roll a d20 per 10 minutes searching (or whatever unit of time corresponds to a “turn” or encounter check in your exploration rules) - if the roll plus the library’s rating is equal to or greater than 20, and the book is present, then it has been found. If the book is not present and the roll is equal to or greater than 20, then the characters have figured out that it’s not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Browsing&lt;/em&gt;  In the case of browsing, a character finds one potentially useful book every 20 minutes. Determine the book’s tags and rating as detailed in the Books section below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/606/277/large/francisco-segura-lv100.jpg?1428336078&#34;&gt;https://cdn.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/606/277/large/francisco-segura-lv100.jpg?1428336078&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;  Books are potentially extremely valuable to characters - either as loot to sell or as sources of useful information. The rules below specify methods for generating a random book as needed, as well as for making use of books for on-the-fly reference and long term study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Characteristics&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt;: Books have tags just like libraries, but usually no more than 2.   &lt;em&gt;Rating&lt;/em&gt;: Books have a rating equal to the quality level of their library +/- d3. For books found outside of a library, assume a quality level of d3 and add +/- d3 as usual.  &lt;em&gt;Usefulness&lt;/em&gt;: A book with a rating below the character&amp;rsquo;s level is considered not useful to them. Consider the absolute value of negatively rated books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Books&lt;/em&gt;  Referencing a Book  If a character has a book on relevant subject, they may reference it to answer a question pertaining to that matter. A book can generally answer 1d10 + its rating of questions related to its tagged subject material. Once all of a book’s questions have been used, it is still useful for study or as part of a personal library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternate Reference Rule:&lt;/em&gt; If your ruleset makes use of a skill system, allow the player to add the books rating to their skill check. This may take some scaling depending on the method of skill resolution, as the rating assumes a skill system based on x-in-6 chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying a Book  Studying a book is when the characters spends time reading it and internalizing it, and actually learning the contents. This takes a number of weeks equal to the book’s rating (minimum of one week). In the case of a negative rating, it takes the same time, but at the end of it, the player realizes what a crock of shit the book was. Assuming the book has a positive rating, at the end of the study period, the character gains knowledge of the book’s subject matter. If you use a skill system, they gain an entry-level skill, and if not, the player should simply note that their character is especially knowledgable on that topic and the referee should adjudicate accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2txb0Yc6Z1qabm59o1_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2txb0Yc6Z1qabm59o1_1280.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Generating a Random Book *  Whenever you need to generate a book on the fly, such as when a character successfully browses a library, use the following method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating  Equal to the Library’s Quality Modifier +/- d3 (treat 1-3 as negative and 4-6 as positive). As with libraries, books &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have a negative value - it contains confusing nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tags  The book will have 1d2 tags, chosen from among those the library has. Either determine randomly, or choose a likely/interesting combination. If players have specified a type of book, obviously apply those tags in the case of a successful search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author  For authors, use the appropriate name list for the book’s origin (you may randomly determine origin using the standard NPC race roll).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Format  Use the format for the library if found in a library, otherwise randomly determine or choose from the list of book formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value  - Rating x # of tags x 10 Gold Marks  - If a player is buying a negatively rated book from a seller, treat the negative rating as positive - the nonsense looks plausible until studied  - Booksellers have a more practiced eye for nonsense, and so will only give 1/4 the value calculated above (they’ll still buy it, since they can sell to a fool)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Libraries that know the subject matter of a negatively rated book will refuse to buy it, unless it has historical or cultural significance of some kind, or is considered dangerous&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noisms/David McGrogan has done some really fantastic stuff with generating player characters&amp;rsquo; social circles in more urban games - most notably in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144820/YoonSuin&#34;&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/a&gt;, and in development for his new setting/game &amp;ldquo;There is Therefore a Strange Land&amp;rdquo;, as shown in &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2015/04/there-is-therefore-strange-land-concept.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. In that post, he provides a table for generating a fence (not a physical barrier around a yard, but a person who buys dubiously acquired merchandise), and I have found it tremendously inspirational for Fellhold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have been creating tables for &amp;ldquo;specialist NPCs&amp;rdquo; that fulfill various key roles for PCs, including fences to buy their stuff. Additionally, though, I am detailing out Patrons (people with influence in certain social circles), Merchants (people who will sell you stuff), and my current favorite, Sages (people who can provide information). Every kind of NPC gets their own table that provides what they focus on, some relevant info to their specialty (like how much they charge/pay for merchants and fences), and some &amp;ldquo;spice&amp;rdquo; meant to create game hooks. Each kind of NPC also has a circle of contacts that can be generated as needed, and a table of jobs that they can hire the PCs for. The goal is for a handful of these specialist NPCs to serve as nodes for fractal adventure and intrigue generation that meshes smoothly with the other urbancrawl adventure generation stuff like Lairs and rumors and factions and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the current draft of my sage rules. The part I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of is the &amp;ldquo;petty rivalry&amp;rdquo; column, as it both seems fitting for academics/artists, but also because I think it creates a lot of room for motivating adventure in a very sage-y way. I&amp;rsquo;m less keen on the jobs - they don&amp;rsquo;t feel as flavorful, I may have to revisit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/49/b6/db/49b6db2e31103527dbf618a93be4308d.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/49/b6/db/49b6db2e31103527dbf618a93be4308d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**   **  &lt;strong&gt;Sages&lt;/strong&gt;  Sages are specialist academics or artists who can be invaluable consultants in their area of specialty and are largely useless outside of it. They are primarily useful for the information they provide, and are surprisingly connected to other NPCs. There is about a half and half chance that any given sage has any practical skills or experience in their area of interest - but all are extremely knowledgeable. Sages are especially useful for shedding light on potential clues and giving a less biased opinion on the value of found objects than a fence. Many sages are also collectors of items related to their area of interest and may be customers of fences. Roll on the table below to generate - gender may be decided by looking at the die rolled for race (or any other) - odd indicates male, even female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVrAAAAJDUxMmI1OTNhLTM5MDQtNDQ1OS05ZTFmLTI0Mzc5MDQ1ZmJmMw.jpg&#34;&gt;https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVrAAAAJDUxMmI1OTNhLTM5MDQtNDQ1OS05ZTFmLTI0Mzc5MDQ1ZmJmMw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;District  &amp;amp; Faction Relationships*  As with other NPCs, a sage should be a member of a faction and should have a district to live in, which can be determined randomly or chosen based on relevant factors (area of interest, faction, and so forth). When generating a sage&amp;rsquo;s contacts, be sure to keep these factors in mind to suggest relationships and locations for these contacts.  *   *  &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/780/flashcards/7528780/jpg/a-hadamart-the-salon-of-1699-engraving-crow-painters-008-500x258-15042DBBE85572ADC43.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/780/flashcards/7528780/jpg/a-hadamart-the-salon-of-1699-engraving-crow-painters-008-500x258-15042DBBE85572ADC43.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  *   *  *Sage’s Contacts*  A Library tagged to their area of interest  D6 Other Sages of diverse interests (consider rolling additional petty rivalries as desired)  A Fence related to their area of interest  A Patron that enjoys their area of interest  A merchant that sells something essential to their area of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-06-22-what-do-you-do-in-city-default/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=boydBraas&amp;amp;CISOPTR=83&amp;amp;action=2&amp;amp;DMSCALE=90&amp;amp;DMWIDTH=369&amp;amp;DMHEIGHT=460&amp;amp;DMX=0&amp;amp;DMY=0&amp;amp;DMTEXT=&amp;amp;DMROTATE=0&#34;&gt;http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=boydBraas&amp;amp;CISOPTR=83&amp;amp;action=2&amp;amp;DMSCALE=90&amp;amp;DMWIDTH=369&amp;amp;DMHEIGHT=460&amp;amp;DMX=0&amp;amp;DMY=0&amp;amp;DMTEXT=&amp;amp;DMROTATE=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I decided that the rebooted Fellhold is a massive dungeon-city/city-dungeon, I have been giving a lot of thought to Urbancrawling rules. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36473/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-urbancrawls&#34;&gt;This series&lt;/a&gt; of posts at the Alexandrian covered the topic in a lot of detail, and helped me to organize my thinking, including the core idea of having a &amp;ldquo;default action&amp;rdquo;. And Paolo&amp;rsquo;s discussion of his game &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tsojcanth.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/gangs-bullshit-the-gang/&#34;&gt;Gangs &amp;amp; Bullshit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; introduced the idea of structuring how you &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;zoom out&amp;rdquo;, and when I smashed the two ideas together, I felt a tremendous &amp;ldquo;A-ha!&amp;rdquo; moment, but I was probably just slow in putting together something obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea is that players have a default &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; where they do highly abstracted, easily resolved stuff, but that when things go wrong, you zoom into traditional RPG resolution. Making this work, especially with lots of players pursuing different things and getting different complications, might take some skilled refereeing - I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested this yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for players is to have a clear set of options of &amp;ldquo;what can I do?&amp;rdquo; when that isn&amp;rsquo;t clear. For referees, I want something flexible enough to handle whatever is happening in their game, but with enough structure to help figure out how to make things interesting if it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious. The part I&amp;rsquo;m most pleased with is the ease with which you can slot this into different time length &amp;ldquo;turns&amp;rdquo; - I assume a default of a week as long enough to help time pass and encourage longer-term thinking, but short enough to be easy to go &amp;ldquo;well, while you&amp;rsquo;re in the  middle of fixing up your hideout, that broker you stiffed walks in with 5 goons&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My chief concern with the rules as presented is that there might be too many options for urbancrawl actions and that the &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse World&lt;/em&gt; inspired mechanic (6 under equals bad fail, 7- 9 = success with complications, and 10+ = Great Success) might produce too many complications for the urbancrawl actions to be meaningful, or for enough time to pass to accomplish longer term goals. I&amp;rsquo;m also not sure how hard it will get having 4+ people running around doing different actions each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Go5t-nScZ3M/TYM72GmKwfI/AAAAAAAABJk/5IykczBQ6sY/s1600/Clocks_0001_NEW.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Go5t-nScZ3M/TYM72GmKwfI/AAAAAAAABJk/5IykczBQ6sY/s320/Clocks_0001_NEW.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Scales&lt;/strong&gt;  The referee may make use of any or all of these timescales for urbancrawl actions as needed. One week is the suggested default amount of time, but different campaigns may have different needs. Even with a default length &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo;, referees may occasionally find it useful to make use of other scales - such as moving from a default of one week turns to watch-long turns while the party prepares a heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since several other urbancrawl rules use “the urbancrawl action” as their timescale, they may need to be adjusted occasionally due to the nature of the activity, or due to the actions of other player characters. If one player character is trying to make friends and another is staking out a house, you may need to adjust how you resolve one or the other depending on what timescale you choose.  *   *  &lt;strong&gt;Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;  The default timescale for urbancrawl actions, it&amp;rsquo;s enough time to get some stuff done, but granular enough that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to zoom in on and coordinate between different players&amp;rsquo; activities.  *   *  &lt;strong&gt;Days&lt;/strong&gt;  Some actions would just be a bit ridiculous to take an entire week to pursue (talking to one person, for example), in which case, the referee can &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; to a scale of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, while for some groups it may be appropriate for carousing to be resolved as week-long benders, for others it will make much more sense to resolve as one evening and its aftereffects  *   *  &lt;strong&gt;Watches&lt;/strong&gt;  Watches fill a role somewhere between a standard exploration turn and a day - they are eight hour chunks, or one third of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scale is useful for detailed (but mostly uncontested) exploration, movement over large amounts of space, or for stake outs and other situations with long bouts of nothing happening but the potential for something important to happen at any time  *   *  &lt;strong&gt;RPG Time&lt;/strong&gt;  This scale is the standard way time is handled in most RPGSs - long stretches of fairly unstructured time, sometimes moment by moment, other times skipping hours or days, punctuated by intensely tracked round by round time for situations involving danger and high stakes. This scale is recommended for traditional &amp;ldquo;adventures&amp;rdquo;, and for resolving many of the complications arising out of the urbancrawl actions (otherwise known as &amp;ldquo;where the game is&amp;rdquo;). The urbancrawl action is not invoked here, and instead the referee should use the rules and procedures appropriate to their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/spalding/images/industry/0006.jpg&#34;&gt;http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/spalding/images/industry/0006.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolving the Urbancrawl Action&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Rolling&lt;/strong&gt;  To resolve an urbancrawl action, the player taking it rolls 2d6 and adds any relevant modifiers determined by the referee. By default, a roll of 6 or less means a failure with complications, 7 - 9 means a success with complications, and a 10 or higher means a smooth success with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that just because an action is listed below does not mean that it must be resolved as an Urbancrawl Action - sometimes shopping can just be shopping. Using the urbancrawl action is meant to generate hooks for interesting play, so only use the action when you want something to be a potential trigger for play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternate Resolution&lt;/em&gt;  If your rules set makes use of a skill system, you can certainly replace the 2d6 roll with a skill check on some relevant skill. If you do so, consider a method to still allow for &amp;ldquo;complicated success&amp;rdquo;, so that the players have a chance to get what they&amp;rsquo;re after while still creating interesting gameable situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the 2d6 roll makes “complicated success” the default, which you may or may not wish to emulate. More successes means more time will pass and more will be accomplished at the urbancrawl level of abstraction. Getting more done at the scale of urbancrawl actions lends itself well to games that are more concerned with organizations and large territory - the city equivalent of the “domain game”. Creating more complications lends itself to more standard adventures and zooming in to a greater level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweak the resolution to suit your table’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifiers&lt;/strong&gt;  The Urbancrawl Action can be modified based on the referee&amp;rsquo;s discretion and the player&amp;rsquo;s ingenuity, due to ability score modifiers, relevant expertise, or level of familiarity with the person or locale being engaged with. Players should always be made aware of the total modifiers before they commit to taking a particular course of action. If using the 2d6 method, modifiers should be capped at plus or minus three,   **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Complications&lt;/strong&gt;  Any time an urbancrawl action fails or succeeds with complications, the referee will determine what they are. Common complications include only getting some of what you were after, extra costs, or other parties becoming interested in the character. Typically, complications should be more severe when accompanying a failure than a complicated success, or when associated with an activity that has been subject to previous complications, but this is not a hard and fast rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some small complications can be resolved with a brief interaction or quick roll - such as a merchant demanding extra money for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point of complications, however, is to produce hooks for the game - this is where the interesting stuff is, and what usually causes a zoom in to &amp;ldquo;RPG Time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough guide, zoom in on complications that can bring in the whole party, and more quickly resolve complications that can only involve one person, unless it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good. If your group wants to act at a bigger scale, resolve more complications abstractly, but if it wants to use the urbancrawl action more as a random adventure seed generator, zoom in on more complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referee is encouraged to come up with their own complications, and especially to find ways to tie complications to existing contacts, factions, rumors, and conspiracies, but each urbancrawl action option below includes six sample complications if the referee is feeling stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6a/82/ef/6a82efadadbc29b6fa1f2bd026ca3173.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6a/82/ef/6a82efadadbc29b6fa1f2bd026ca3173.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Types of Urbancrawl Actions&lt;/strong&gt;  The choices below are by no means the only options, but they are meant to provide a useful starting point and a &amp;ldquo;menu&amp;rdquo; of options if players aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Investigate a . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conspiracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;District   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruined District&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Look for a Job&lt;/em&gt;   *- Train/Research/Get Buff *   &lt;em&gt;- Petty Crime&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;- Do Your Damn Day Job&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;- Shopping&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;- Carouse&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;- Make Friends&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;- Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lifestyles of the Poor and Adventurous</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-06-20-lifestyles-of-poor-and-adventurous/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ajcarlisle.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hobbit-chroniclesdosartdesigng4.jpg&#34;&gt;https://ajcarlisle.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hobbit-chroniclesdosartdesigng4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major &amp;ldquo;themes&amp;rdquo; of my Fellhold reboot (if that&amp;rsquo;s not too grand a word) is the idea of place being important. Factions have turf, demons have loci they are tied to, and some powers only work in certain places. A frequent hole in the sense of place in D&amp;amp;D games is a place for the characters to live - hence all the murderhoboery. I contend that one contributing reason for this is that most cost of living or lifestyle rules suck and are boring. You inject some fun when you start playing the domain game, but before that, it tends to either be total handwaving or else tedious bean counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my stab at making some relatively portable, modular lifestyle rules that can be bolted on to the D&amp;amp;D-alike of your choice. The currencies given assume a silver standard, and the amounts are totally untested, so feel free to adjust. Anywhere you see a reference to &amp;ldquo;an Urbancrawl action&amp;rdquo;, you can substitute in &amp;ldquo;a week&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;one period of downtime.&amp;rdquo; More on what I&amp;rsquo;m up to with Urbancrawl actions soon (hopefully)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual hard and fast rules are kept pretty brief, because I want this to work well regardless of system intricacies, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided creating too much interconnectedness or dependency with the other urbancrawl rules. I&amp;rsquo;ve used rate of healing as the main factor affected, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also thrown in guidelines on what stuff that can just be assumed to be &amp;ldquo;taken care of&amp;rdquo; for a given lifestyle. I&amp;rsquo;m considering easing up on the &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; of homeless and poor, and adding more &amp;ldquo;carrot&amp;rdquo; for comfortable and above, since I see &amp;ldquo;poor&amp;rdquo; as pretty normal for characters for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;  How a player character lives impacts their ability conduct business in the city. Filthy hobos tend not to heal so fast, while those living in the lap of luxury might be more tempting targets for burglars. In addition to the specific rules below, here are some general guidelines for PC lifestyle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone should live &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; on the map - when a player selects
or changes lifestyle, figure out where on the map the place they
stay is - even if they’re homeless, they should have a locale they
tend to stay in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle might provide a small modifier (+/- 1) to the urbancrawl
action, if it seems relevant - for example, a smelly homeless person
trying to investigate a conspiracy playing out in a bog mummy’s
court is going to have a harder time than a sophisticated socialite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likewise, when complications arise from the Urbancrawl action,
consider the player’s lifestyle in applying them - it’s a very
different matter if a rival faction pushes past a watchman and
trashes your luxury apartment than if a petty street gang stomps
your shanty apart with their boots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make lifestyle something besides a transaction to pay more
for better healing - see what details players focus on and find
interesting, and incorporate those into play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle should influence the nature of the contacts a player makes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;richer characters will tend to have higher class contacts. This
isn’t a hard and fast rule, as sometimes the upper crust need some
shady types to get stuff done for them, but if players want more
access to higher social class, they should make efforts to join it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Options&lt;/strong&gt;  Players may choose any of the options below that they can afford. By default, the cost is paid per urbancrawl action (one week is the standard), but the amount or frequency can be adjusted as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yr_zc1QjjJE/UvHup_n7z2I/AAAAAAAABXI/Kxua8q2OPes/s1600/MattRhodes_KvotheInTarbean_Detail.jpg&#34;&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yr_zc1QjjJE/UvHup_n7z2I/AAAAAAAABXI/Kxua8q2OPes/s1600/MattRhodes_KvotheInTarbean_Detail.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homeless&lt;/em&gt;  You are a street person. You eat garbage and your clothes are filthy, probably tattered. You have to constantly watch any belongings you have, or other bums will steal them to sell for food or drugs. Those little items that it sure would be nice if you had? You have to buy those specifically, or you don’t have them. Some cigarettes are a big deal. You are constantly cold, wet, and uncomfortable, so healing doesn’t work out so great. You heal at 1/4 the normal rate. Check constitution once an urbancrawl action - if you fail, you have some kind of minor, persistent, but rather unpleasant disease, like the flu or itchy boils all over. Either use your preferred disease rules, or else take -1 on rolls until you heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example accommodations: crates, tarps, abandoned tunnels, doorways, under bridges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: Free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.revivalgame.com/blog_images/2015/6/26/blog_062615_01.jpg&#34;&gt;https://www.revivalgame.com/blog_images/2015/6/26/blog_062615_01.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor&lt;/em&gt;  You have somewhere tiny and uncomfortable to stay, but it’s dry and reasonably safe. You eat a lot of bread, vegetables when you can get them, and meat is a rare treat. You can put a lock between your stuff and the ravenous outside world, and most folks in your neighborhood don’t have anything worth stealing, so you and your stuff sleep pretty securely, but if you have a lot of it, you might have to figure out where to put all of it. Your clothes are likely second hand or just extremely well worn. You can assume you have a few small, everyday items if it becomes relevant, and you can probably barely afford to smoke and buy coffee, but nothing fancy. Due to poor nutrition, you heal at 1/2 the normal rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example accommodations: tenement apartment, guild dormitory, alms house, attic apartment, shady boarding house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: 5 Silver Skillings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fantasy-faction.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-MAR-Conflict-An-Inn-Across-The-Mountains-by-JonHodgson-263x300.jpg&#34;&gt;http://fantasy-faction.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-MAR-Conflict-An-Inn-Across-The-Mountains-by-JonHodgson-263x300.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comfortable&lt;/em&gt;  Whether it’s a private apartment or a room at a comfortable inn, you have somewhere neat, pleasant, and warm to stay. The food is filling and good for you, if not especially fine. You can occasionally indulge in treats like a good cup of coffee or a pastry. Your clothes are well made and sturdy, and they don’t look terrible. You have enough space for a reasonable amount of stuff, a good solid door with a lock, and people would probably notice if someone was trying to break in. You can go out for drinks or buy your friends coffee pretty regularly, and if you smoke (or indulge in other drugs) you can afford your habit no problem. Any small, everyday item that you could reasonably assume you would have, you have. Since you eat well and rest comfortably, you heal at the normal rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example accommodations: Reputable boarding house, an inn, private apartment, faction quarters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: 1 Gold Mark  *   *  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.candlekeep.com/images/gallery/beholder.jpg&#34;&gt;http://www.candlekeep.com/images/gallery/beholder.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Luxurious&lt;/em&gt;  You live extremely well - comfortable bed, nice furniture, delicious food. You have plenty of stuff, and room for plenty more. You have servants to take care of the cooking and cleaning, and maybe the occasional small errand. There might even be dedicated watchmen to keep an eye on the door and keep the riffraff out. Your clothes are tailored and high quality, likely of the latest fashions, and you can indulge in ridiculous habits like only buying witch-grown coffee. Not only can you assume you have any small, everyday items you might need, once per session, you can declare that you have any one non-magical item that you happen to need right now, since you bought it on a whim at some point. If you could reasonably be carrying it, you are. If it’s large, you’ll have to head back to your place to get it. Due to good food, comfortable rest, and attentive care, you heal at 1.5 times the normal rate. You are somewhat more likely to be the target of burglary, since you have stuff worth stealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example accommodations: Luxury apartment, high quality inn, townhouse, faction leadership quarters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: 10 Gold Marks&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2016-06-16-some-fellhold-random-encounter-tables/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://uo-planescape.wdfiles.com/local--files/quartiere-gilde/Bazaar_by_Tony_Diterlizzi-02620_(1996)_TSR_AD&amp;amp;D_2ed_Planescape-The_Planewalker&#39;s_Handbook.jpg&#34;&gt;http://uo-planescape.wdfiles.com/local--files/quartiere-gilde/Bazaar_by_Tony_Diterlizzi-02620_(1996)_TSR_AD&amp;amp;D_2ed_Planescape-The_Planewalker&#39;s_Handbook.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we continue with some more Fellhold Reboot content - in this case a couple of random encounter tables. There&amp;rsquo;s reference to some district and faction encounters - those are still under developed. The first here is a list of situations you could find your contacts in when you go to find them or bump into them on the street. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a series of rules I&amp;rsquo;m putting together to try to enhance the role contacts play for players in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a &amp;ldquo;generic&amp;rdquo; encounter table, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s not linked to a particular district or faction - you can encounter these anywhere in the city, ruined or inhabited, friendly or hostile. Hopefully it gives a view of the weird &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; life of Fellhold. I&amp;rsquo;m not really doing any new with the formatting or application of these tables, so the main &amp;ldquo;hard problem&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve here is getting the aesthetics right - I have a very strong but vague idea of what I want Fellhold to &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; like, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to inject that into other people&amp;rsquo;s brains. These tables are a start at trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken inspiration from Arnold K&amp;rsquo;s post &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/game-design-when-to-be-random.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where he encourages randomer random tables - the goal is not verismilitude so much as it is creating something interesting and imagination provoking that gives the referee and the players levers to pull and tools to exploit. If I start playtesting these more and find out that a walk down the street is bonkers crazy in a not-fun way, then maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll adjust some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, let me apologize for the terribly formatted table below - I know InDesign, but web layout is not my strong suit.   **   **&lt;strong&gt;Urban Encounters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Encounter Roll&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;1-2 District Encounter&lt;/em&gt;  Roll on the district specific encounter table for the current district. If the district lacks its own encounter table, roll on the generic urban encounters table below. If an encounter is called for and its not clear in which district it would happen, either randomize or use the generic encounter table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3-4  Faction Encounter&lt;/em&gt;  Roll on the encounter table for the faction that controls the current district as turf. If a faction encounter is called for and its not clear which district it would occur in, either select randomly, select the faction that controls the district that a random PC lives in, or pick the one that seems most interesting or relevant in the current situation.  *   *  &lt;em&gt;5 Contact Encounter&lt;/em&gt;  Randomly determine a contact from a randomly determined PC, or else select one that makes the most sense given where the PCs are and what they’re doing. Use the table below to determine what situation they find their contact in. Some referee discretion, as always, may be called for - if the encounter occurs in an overtly hostile part of Fellhold, some of the situations below may not apply, or may apply in a modified way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Dead  2) Fighting desperately with a district encounter  3) Fleeing from something, they press a small package into the PC’s hands   4) Running from watchmen  5) Deep in conversation with someone from a faction hostile to the PC  6) Chatting up an attractive young person  7) Buying something  8) Deep in conversation with someone from one of the PC’s factions  9) Stumbling around disoriented and confused- are they drunk? Or something else?  10) On their way to a broker to act on a sweet tip for the soul market  11) Supervising moving a large amount of material relevant to their career  12) Standing in the middle of the road with a shocked look on their face  13) Examining a structure with great interest  14) Moving furtively, trying to hide their appearance  15) Doing something that seems remarkably out of character, opposite their usual character in fact  16) Wild eyes, crazy hair, frantic  17) Whistling happily, largely oblivious to their surroundings  18) Eating or drinking something  19) In a furious shouting match with someone, possibly about to come to blows  20) Passed out in the gutter  *   *  &lt;em&gt;6 Generic Encounter&lt;/em&gt;  The generic Fellhold encounters table may be used just about anywhere in Fellhold if a more a specific encounter is not available or desired. If a more “mundane” encounter is desired, simply use the contact generation rules and the contact encounter table, but assume that the person so generated is a stranger to the PCs unless otherwise indicated. As always, make use of reaction rolls and interpret in light of the district’s status of friendly, neutral, or hostile. Modify as appropriate to the situation - if the characters are deep in an abandoned dwarven hall, they are unlikely to encounter a wealthy merchant, and if they do, it is likely to be a far different circumstance than bumping into him in the market. The default assumption is that each entry will be encountered alone unless otherwise indicated, but if you like you may generate d3 or d6 of a type if it makes more sense. If needed, consult the random faction table to assign the encounter a faction. As always, use only those columns that make sense and are necessary. Likewise, feel free to ignore any results that don’t fit the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic Fellhold Encounters&lt;/strong&gt;  When no more specific encounter table is applicable, this encounter table may be used. This table may also be used to generate slightly more “exotic” NPCs than the default NPC generation chart for use outside of random encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, this table may be used either by rolling once and reading straight across, or rolling for each column separately. If an entry refers to another encounter, you may roll again or simply use the next line if speed is desired. Note that as with the NPC table, the columns proceed in roughly the order of most obvious to least obvious, so that you may roll only on those columns necessary, if desired. Location may be ignored if the placement of the encounter has already been determined.&lt;/p&gt;
