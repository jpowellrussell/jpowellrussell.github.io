&lt;p&gt;So, I wanted to try a little experiment.  I got &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/courtney-campbell/on-the-non-player-character/paperback/product-21094131.html&#34;&gt;On the Non-Player Character&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; back when it first came out, skimmed it, read some reviews, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t read it fully until the last few days.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about using it for regular encounters and the like, but I was struck with the idea to use it to do off-screen faction interactions, like in a mega-dungeon.  So I&amp;rsquo;m going to do the experiment here (I&amp;rsquo;m also trying out the &amp;ldquo;After the Break&amp;rdquo; feature, which I just learned how to use).  So, after the break, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Courtney Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s Encounter rules used for faction interactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for this experiment, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna use the Skull Clan Goblins, Spear Clan Hobgoblins, and a Group of Human Bandits that have all taken up residence in adjoining areas of Fellhold.  I&amp;rsquo;ve given each group a little &amp;ldquo;stat block&amp;rdquo;.  For simplicity, I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring things like Leader&amp;rsquo;s Charisma, the stance options towards each other or individual reactions to different stances.  I&amp;rsquo;m keeping Bond in there for modifying rolls, so if you wanted to use more factors, you could just make a &amp;ldquo;modifier with X&amp;rdquo; category and roll bond into those other modifiers, or have a &amp;ldquo;base modifier&amp;rdquo; that applies to all interactions.  When it comes to &amp;ldquo;if monsters feel weaker or stronger&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m using the morale value as a measure of felt strength. Starting Bonds and Morale ratings were assigned by me based on my characterization of the factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skull Clan&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Reaction Roll: 4&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Spear Clan: 6 (0)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Bandits: 3 (-2)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Morale: 5&lt;/em&gt;   *   *&lt;strong&gt;Spear Clan&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Reaction Roll: 12&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Skull Clan: 6 (0)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Bandits: 5 (-2)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Morale: 7&lt;/em&gt;   *   *&lt;strong&gt;Bandits&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Reaction Roll: 9&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Spear Clan: 5 (-2)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Skull Clan: 3 (-2)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Morale: 8&lt;/em&gt;   *   *So, here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about proceeding from here.  I&amp;rsquo;m only rolling once per faction to keep things simple, since even with only 3 factions interacting with each other, things are already getting complex.  So, each faction applies its bond with the other faction to its one reaction roll to see what their action this round is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction Table   (Roll: Action (Effect on Bond))   2: Attack/Flee (Bond -2)   3-5: Threaten (Bond -1)   6-8: Converse (Bond +0)   9-11: Trade (Bond +1)   12: Hire/Ally (Bond +2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the Skull clan ends up with a 4 with the spear clan and a 2 with the Bandits.  The Spear Clan&amp;rsquo;s results are a 12 with the Skull Clan and a 10 with the Bandits, and the Bandits got a 7 with the Spear Clan and a 7 with the Skull Clan.  The results are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skull Clan&lt;/strong&gt;   Spear Clan: Threaten (Bond -1)   Bandits: Attack/Flee (Bond -2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spear Clan&lt;/strong&gt;   Skull Clan: Hire/Ally (Bond +2)   Bandits: Trade (Bond +1)   **   Bandits**   Spear Clan: Converse (Bond +0)   Skull Clan: Converse (Bond +0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to keep things simple, rather than the roll being a reaction from the other party, it will be the action taken by the rolling side.  So, the &amp;ldquo;Attack/Flee&amp;rdquo; result between the skull clan and Bandits means that the Skull Clan will attack or flee the bandits, rather than the other way around.  Since the Skull Clan has lower morale (feels weaker) they flee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make everything make sense, I&amp;rsquo;ll throw in some interpretation.  It looks like the Spear Clan was the real mover and shaker this &amp;ldquo;round&amp;rdquo;.  After some threats from the Skull Clan motivated by their retreat from the Bandits, the Spear Clan hires them as goons.  Feeling more secure, they&amp;rsquo;re willing to trade with the Bandits, who are feeling fairly neutral towards everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these actions, with a few more modifications, we get the new &amp;ldquo;stat blocks&amp;rdquo;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that &amp;ldquo;fleeing&amp;rdquo; a stronger opponent lowers your morale by 1, whereas either a successful attack or hiring/allying raises it by 1.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also capped Bond at 2-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skull Clan&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Spear Clan: 7 (0)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Bond with Bandits: 2 (-4)&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;Morale: 4&lt;/em&gt;   **   Spear Clan**   *Bond with Skull Clan: 7 (0)*   *Bond with Bandits: 4 (-2)*   *Morale: 6*   **   Bandits**   *Bond with Skull Clan: 2 (-4)*   *Bond with Spear Clan: 4 (0)*   *Morale: 5*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I like this because it&amp;rsquo;s an aid to creating some dynamism, the probability distribution plus modifiers creates some trends that will hopefully over time suggest power dynamics, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple with just one roll per faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas for greater complexity that I considered and decided against (for now) that you can try if you&amp;rsquo;re into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each faction has a modifier towards each other - bond is not shared,
which could create some more asymmetries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use initial reaction roll as for a regular encounter and that&amp;rsquo;s the
number of actions the faction can take with the other faction (this
makes for more of a solitaire mini-game)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a d20 list of almost all of the actions from &amp;ldquo;On the NPC&amp;rdquo; and
use them with the above to randomly determine what action each
faction takes per action (this would be more swingy but possibly
create more adventure hooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give each faction hit points (subdual or otherwise) and work out
combat/social encounters using those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Some Spells</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-13-some-spells/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m going through the spell lists to try to make them more appropriate for the shape that wizards are starting to take in Fellhold.  My good friend (Yllgrad&amp;rsquo;s player, if you follow the play report posts at all) sent me some spell ideas (Troll Form, Create Familiar, Orb of Many Colors, Volsungr&amp;rsquo;s Anvil, and Summon Spiders are all based on his stuff), and that got me started working on the spell descriptions.  The others are takes on other games&amp;rsquo; spells (Command is inspired by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/&#34;&gt;LotFP&lt;/a&gt; spell of the same name, and Oak Skin is inspired by Oakenheart from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/116758/Ambition-%26-Avarice-1st-Edition&#34;&gt;Ambition and Avarice&lt;/a&gt; (which you should buy, it&amp;rsquo;s great), and Sleep is my simplified version of the ever-confusingly worded classic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, Command and Create Familiar have the most of my work in them, but I think I like Volsungr&amp;rsquo;s Anvil the best. It was the one my friend was most excited about and thought of first, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately suggest a most-obvious use.  It looks like it could be insanely powerful in the right situations and useless in others, both largely dependent on how clever the player using it is being, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on a version of the LotFP summon spell that is less tentacular horrors from beyond Lovecraft and more demony and spirity (still rampantly dangerous and corrupting, just in a more anthropomorphic way) and generally trying to make a better distinction between what it is that worshipers of pseudo-Odin do and what &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; wizards do.  At any rate, here are some spells:&lt;/p&gt;

The target will only attempt to perform the command for one round, and gains a bonus to its saving throw equal to 1 per syllable after the first the wizard uses.  “Die” will only make the target pass out for one round.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;  *The wizard causes up to 2d8 HD of creatures with up to 4+1 HD to fall into a magical slumber.  *  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Level 2&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Troll Form&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;The wizard grants one target the form and strength of a troll.  He grows visibly larger and his skin becomes knotty and spiked.  He gains 4 HD of hit points and increases his strength to 19. He cannot cast spells and must make a save vs spell modified by wisdom every round to avoid becoming an uncontrollable rage monster.  Lasts 1d6+1 rounds and may target self. Apply all damage received in troll form to target’s normal HP when spell ends.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Create Familiar&lt;/em&gt;  *The wizard may imbue some of his magical energy into a small animal to create a familiar.  No animal larger than a dog may be selected.  The wizard performs a ritual that takes all night long  and transfers a number of doom dice of his choice into the familiar.  The materials for the ritual cost 50 SP per doom die transferred.  The familiar will gain 1 HD and 1 point of intelligence per doom die spent.  *  *   *  &lt;em&gt;The wizard will be able to direct the familiar’s actions and sense what it senses.  The familiar can also be used as a hex to cast any spell the wizard knows. It has a spell level equal to the doom dice imbued.  Its integrity is equal to the sum of a number of d10s equal to the doom dice used, plus 2d4 per extra 50 sp spent on materials used in the ritual, to a maximum of 6d4.  If used to cast from a hex, roll as normal.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;The familiar can be imbued with further doom dice at any time by repeating the ritual (same costs for materials).&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;If the familiar dies, the doom dice return to the wizard, but the trauma does an amount of damage equal to all of the doom dice rolled (for example, the death of a 3 doom die familiar would deal 3d6 damage to the wizard), and the doom dice cannot be rolled for doom points until after a full rest.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Oakskin&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Improve your AC by your level for 1d6 rounds as your skin is covered in thick, gnarly bark.  You are more flammable and count as wooden target for axes, though.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Orb of Many Colors&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;The wizard creates a ball of ever-changing light and hurls it at a target (roll to attack as for a thrown weapon).  Depending on the color when the ball strikes, there is a different effect.  All effects have a radius equal to 10 feet per the wizard’s level.  Randomly determine the color:&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;1. White – Save vs spell +2 or be blinded for 1d4 turns&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;2. Blue – Everyone is healed for 1d4 hp&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;3. Purple – Save vs spell +2 or fall asleep for 1d4 turns&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;4. Green – Summons a giant insect who will attack anyone nearby.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;5. Yellow – Everyone is teleported 30 feet away in a random direction (determine seperately for each individual, use a three dimensional method). If this places someone wholly or partially in a solid object, they are not killed, they are just fused with that object&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;6. Red – All metal (non-magical) items have a 1 in 6 chance of becoming rusted and useless.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Volsungr’s Anvil&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;The wizard touches an inanimate object no larger than a man and for the next 3d6 rounds, it becomes completely immovable to anyone else and remarkably light to the wizard.&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Level 3&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Summon Spiders&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;The caster summons forth a swarm of spiders to overwhelm anyone within a 10 ft radius. The spiders descend upon all caught in the area. Anyone caught by the spiders takes 1d4 damage per round from spider bites and must make a morale check the first round they are exposed to the spiders.  There is a one in six chance the spiders are poisonous and they will disperse normally (usually within 1d6 rounds).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Granularity of Megadungeons</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-12-the-granularity-of-megadungeons/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 07:45:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-12-the-granularity-of-megadungeons/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-12-the-granularity-of-megadungeons/ -&lt;p&gt;Because I ought to be working on the spell list for the updated magic rules so that the new wizard character can actually do his thing, so of course I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about megadungeons instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jpqCRtbBnks/UqnVLWVq7OI/AAAAAAAAAZc/WjAGmZ1ObYc/s1600/%C3%BCrg%C3%BCp+yeralt%C4%B1+%C5%9Fehri+ile+ilgili+g%C3%B6rseller3.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jpqCRtbBnks/UqnVLWVq7OI/AAAAAAAAAZc/WjAGmZ1ObYc/s320/%C3%BCrg%C3%BCp+yeralt%C4%B1+%C5%9Fehri+ile+ilgili+g%C3%B6rseller3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Derinkuyu: Real Dungeon. Google it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kjd-imc.org/hall-of-fame/setting-design/node-based-megadungeon/&#34;&gt;node-based megadungeon design&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ve got various dungeon map generators, dating back to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Edition-Premium-Dungeon-Masters-Guide/dp/0786962410/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1386860576&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=ad%26d+1st+edition&#34;&gt;1st Edition DMG&lt;/a&gt;.  I think these two extremes of granularity (very little and very much respectively) are missing a sweet spot in a methodology for designing a megadungeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2012/11/first-fellhold-rules-post.html&#34;&gt;faltering attempts&lt;/a&gt; at this back when I was starting up the Fellhold campaign a little more than a year ago.  Looking back at it just now, it&amp;rsquo;s not as embarrassing as I was afraid it would be, but it&amp;rsquo;s also not as useful as I thought at the time.  For one, I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten around to posting the worksheets or sample tables I intended to make, but for another, it basically boils down to a step-by-step of what anybody who&amp;rsquo;s been refereeing for a month or two has picked up about any dungeon creation, and treats megadungeons as just a lot of connected regular dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently reading through Gus L&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/search/label/HMS%20Apollyon&#34;&gt;HMS Apollyon&lt;/a&gt; posts, though, has really crystallized for me the idea that megadungeons are not just many connected regular dungeons, nor one large normal dungeon, nor still a hex crawl that happens to be underground.  They occupy a weird in-between space that I think could still use some support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about diving into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something  like the node-based design for creating overall physical
and informational connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An approach or some rules for how dungeon denizens move/pass
information along these connections, not just adventurers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something like tags or traits to quickly and easily communicate
&amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for an area, and a good way to present it that&amp;rsquo;s better than
just &amp;ldquo;write this down at the top of your map&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to prevent a megadungeon from seeming like a finite, clearable
space without being ridiculous (no &amp;ldquo;oh, hundreds of goblins moved in
over night&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some better way to manage faction interactions than just &amp;ldquo;remember
that there are factions and have them do stuff in the background.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Courtney Campbell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2013/07/on-non-player-character.html&#34;&gt;On
the Non Player
Character&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
is giving me some thoughts on this right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not just ideas on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; tables to have, but ideas on how to make
them, and why it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to make tables instead of just putting
stuff in there that you make up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some thoughts on what to do with the dungeon besides make it a place
where monsters live and traps are (&lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick
Stuart&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/search/label/Veins&#34;&gt;Veins of the
Earth&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; posts
have really been making me think about the environment as its own
thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve got for right now. If all of this has been awesomely covered somewhere else, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear it, as that would let me move on to my idea for a PvP D&amp;amp;D game of adventuring companies (think conquistadors and (East) India Company).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High Level Fighters, What&#39;s Going On?</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-11-high-level-fighters-whats-going-on/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aufnweCZlYA/UqjEaQcG_ZI/AAAAAAAAAZI/OCLEaWYR0Hs/s1600/he_man_said_hey_by_cottommy-d48epne.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aufnweCZlYA/UqjEaQcG_ZI/AAAAAAAAAZI/OCLEaWYR0Hs/s320/he_man_said_hey_by_cottommy-d48epne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after being shamed by the accurate description at Charles Akin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://dyverscampaign.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-great-blog-roll-call.html&#34;&gt;Great Blog Roll Call&lt;/a&gt; of my posting habits (ridiculously infrequent), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put up a quick post with some thoughts from a recent Google+ conversation, and to work on my concision to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solicited some ideas about how much damage higher-level fighters should do in older types of D&amp;amp;D.  In OD&amp;amp;D and the various flavors of Basic-derived D&amp;amp;D, fighters don&amp;rsquo;t really get a bunch of attacks or damage bonuses beyond whatever they start with (okay, except against 1HD foes). This is a problem for one of my players, probably because his character is currently facing off against a Lava Golem worshiped as a god, and it has a fat stack of hit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m torn.  On the one hand, the exact thing I was thinking when I statted up this bad boy was that A) previous attempts at &amp;ldquo;tough&amp;rdquo; monsters were a cakewalk, and B) a slug fest would probably not be the most effective tactic.  So it has excellent AC and buckets of hit points, but some vulnerabilities both combat-wise and fictionally (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into it in case any of my players read this - the fight is still going).  Also, more generally, I like the idea that fighters are really good at killing people and people-like things, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t super-powered death machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, fighting is the one schtick fighters get.  If their ability to fight doesn&amp;rsquo;t change as the challenges they face do, they might end up bringing nothing mechanical to the table.  It&amp;rsquo;s all well and good to put the focus on player creativity, shenanigans, and operating at different scales, but if those are options available to all classes and those classes &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; can cast spells, then that sucks for fighter players.  So I have some sympathy for the idea that no matter how badass you get at hitting, at some point maxing out at 8-10 damage per round is going to limit your effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t decided, but in the meantime, here are some suggestions from the Googlesphere, put here so I can find them later (if the authors take issue with me sharing their thoughts or linking to their G+ profile, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll take it down):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;M. Diaz&lt;/a&gt;:   &amp;ldquo;1) fighters can make any number of attacks in a round, so long as the sum of the HD of the targets do not exceed the fighter&amp;rsquo;s level   2) fighters deal +d6 damage every other level   3) fighters can make an additional attack per round every other level   4) fighters add their level to weapon damage rolls﻿&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/+JasonHobbs&#34;&gt;Jason Hobbs&lt;/a&gt;:   &amp;ldquo;Deed Die, a la DCC!﻿&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve actually done it, but I think that is the direction I would lean. Without using a table or simply doing a multiplier of the damage, I might consider doing something that fits the fiction of the deed die the player used. No fiction, no extra damage. With fiction, you could damage a sword arm or something more specific to whatever fiction the player described. Could add some dynamic aspects to the combat.﻿&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/+DaveDunaway&#34;&gt;Dave Dunaway&lt;/a&gt; has a pretty creative solution:  &amp;ldquo;One idea I&amp;rsquo;m kicking around in my head is to have fighter&amp;rsquo;s weapons get a small chance of acquiring the powers of the monster&amp;rsquo;s it kills. So, after killing a dragon there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility that it gains a bonus to hit or damage or gets a flame or acid effect. In theory, this allows the weapon to &amp;ldquo;gain levels&amp;rdquo; along side the fighter and increase damage organically as they acquire experience.   At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;d hope that this makes the sword&amp;rsquo;s lineage and history more important. Aragorn&amp;rsquo;s sword wasn&amp;rsquo;t cool because is was a +2 longsword (although it may have been), but because it has a story behind it.﻿&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>[UPDATE] Occult Magic for Fellhold</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-05-occult-magic-for-fellhold/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-12-05-occult-magic-for-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://images19.fotki.com/v27/photos/4/41638/2024361/13066wizardvan-vi.jpg&#34;&gt;http://images19.fotki.com/v27/photos/4/41638/2024361/13066wizardvan-vi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[edit: In my excitement, I was pretty lazy about attributing sources or making explicit how much stuff I got directly from other folks, so I&amp;rsquo;ve edited the post to reflect that.  In adding the proper attributions, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty embarrassing how little of this stuff is my own. ]&lt;/em&gt;   *   *This seemed to warrant a blog post. Here are the (mostly) complete rules for Wizard (magic user) magic in the new Fellhold house rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a modification of the rules at Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s Last Gasp Grimoire &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/do-not-take-me-for-some-turner-of-cheap-tricks/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Many of the &amp;ldquo;Chaos Reigns&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;That Which Should Not Be&amp;rdquo;, along with a few of the Corruption results came from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/2013/07/black-magic-remix.html&#34;&gt;Black Magic Remix&lt;/a&gt; at gloomtrain.  The &amp;ldquo;taint&amp;rdquo; results came from &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2012/08/passenger-class-characters.html&#34;&gt;this Dungeon of Signs&lt;/a&gt; entry with barely any changes except reducing to a D20 table, and many of the other corruptions are from the Warhammer 40k roleplaying games and from DCCRPG, but with different mechanics (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to streamline a few things, but I may have gone a bit nutty with the tables.  It ought to be fairly easy to make the big result tables optional and ad-lib weird stuff or come up with your own.  Speaking of which, I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured anything out for patrons yet, other than the vaguest guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all of this stealing other people&amp;rsquo;s stuff, what&amp;rsquo;s my own? Not a lot! But a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When wizard&amp;rsquo;s (magic users) advance in level, they get 2 picks from
some standardized advances. One of those picks is to get a new Doom
die, which a wizard can pick twice at a level-up.  Other choices
include improving saving throws, gaining HD, or improving attack
bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a wizard chooses to gain a new doom die, he makes a save vs
spell with a penalty equal to the new Doom die total. If he fails,
he gains a corruption point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corruption points are detailed below, but my contribution is that
every time you get a new one, you roll a number of d6s equal to your
current total, and if you get certain values, suffer a taint, minor
corruption, major corruption, or utter malignancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are spaced out so that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get worse results with
low numbers, but it will quickly become more and more likely that
you get weird effects until it&amp;rsquo;s almost guaranteed you become a
weird creepy monster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occult Magic&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;em&gt;[These are taken almost entirely and sometimes verbatim from Logan Knight&amp;rsquo;s Last Gasp Grimoire, with some of the table entries from M. Diaz&amp;rsquo;s gloomtrain, and the Taint table is made up of entries from Gus L. at Dungeon of Signs. To make these attributions absolutely clear (which I failed to do originally), I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the following color coding to indicate where things come from along with tons of links:&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logan Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M. Diaz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gus L.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me, Jeff Russell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   *   *&lt;em&gt;If anyone sees anything of theirs that I have not attributed properly, please do not hesitate to contact me and let me know how you&amp;rsquo;d like to handle it. I&amp;rsquo;m all about people getting credit for their awesome ideas.]&lt;/em&gt;   *   *  &lt;strong&gt;Learning Spells&lt;/strong&gt;  Wizards begin play with 1d6 spells of 1d3 level each.  After this, they must find spells and record them in their spellbook or research them.  Wizards can transcribe or research spells of any level that is equal to or less than the number of doom dice they have.  **   **    &lt;strong&gt;Casting Spells&lt;/strong&gt;  *   *&lt;em&gt;Doom Points&lt;/em&gt;  As wizards increase in power, they can cast more and more powerful spells safely.   **   **    Every wizard has a Doom point pool as an easy measure of how much casting is safe, and every spell uses points equal to its level. A wizard may cast rather high level spells early on, but that will make any further spellcasting very risky.  **   **    If a wizard attempts to cast the same spell more than once in a day roll on Conduit of the Cosmos. Repeatedly calling up that kind of power in the same way can attract unwanted attention.  **   **    Once a wizard has reached his Doom limit, he can attempt to cast further spells with a Cast the Bones roll, taking a penalty for every point needed after the first.  *   *  &lt;em&gt;Doom Dice&lt;/em&gt;  ****     After each extended rest, a wizard may roll a d6 per doom die they possess.  The total of the dice rolled together is the number of Doom Points the wizard has available that day.  Wizards gain doom dice as advances when they level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spell Components&lt;/em&gt;  Spell components can be used to gain a bonus to Cast the Bones/Conduit of the Cosmos rolls, or if the Wizard hasn’t already reached their casting limit can be used instead of Doom points, channelling the energy through more of a prepared ritual rather than the caster’s mind and body.  **   **    Spell components take an extra round per bonus to prepare, and in terms of encumbrance an item’s worth of spell components is enough for 5 bonuses.  **   **  &lt;em&gt;Casting from a Spellbook&lt;/em&gt;  Unless they have already turned to the spell in preparation, casting from a spellbook takes one round longer than usual while they turn through the pages to the correct spot.  **   **    &lt;em&gt;Casting from Prepared Items&lt;/em&gt;  Wizards can inscribe specific spells onto individual items that they keep ready rather than in a spellbook.  Each of these counts as one slot for encumbrance purposes, even if it is in fact very small, and it needs to be accessible in the fast inventory section.  The wizard should detail what it is and where he keeps it.  **   **    &lt;em&gt;Casting from a Hex&lt;/em&gt;  A hex is a physical object that channels a particular spell.  It can only be used by wizards, as it does not cast the spell itself, it only acts as a channel and focus for the magical forces involved. Hexes can only be inscribed with one spell.  **   **    Hexes can only be crafted from items that have undergone prolonged exposure to magical energies. Possessions, bones, building materials, anything that has seen much spellcraft.  **   **    Casting using a hex does not use any Doom points, as the hex bears the strain of the spell.  **   **    Hexes can also provide a bonus equal to their spell level when used to enhance a Conduit of the Cosmos roll. This can be used with any spell, and uses Doom points as normal.  **   **    Inscribing a spell takes spell level x 2d6 days, and costs 50sp per day for components necessary to prepare the item.   **   **    Every hex has an Integrity value based on how many years organic items were exposed to magic, or how many decades for inorganic items. If it isn’t known how long it was exposed to magic, roll percentile dice to determine how many years/decades. Integrity can be increased by 2d4 by spending a further day fortifying the hex with smaller mystical materials, such as those suitable for material components. This can be done a maximum of 3 times and costs nothing but the materials.  **   **    When a spell is inscribed it decreases the hex’s Integrity by 1d4 per spell level. If a hex is Insignificant (like a pinky bone in a vial), it only has half the Integrity it would normally have.  **   **    Every time the wizard uses the hex, he has to roll under its Integrity, otherwise Integrity is decreased by d100. When it reaches zero the hex is torn apart by the energy being channeled through it and they must roll on the Overload chart. If the hex was Insignificant roll d10 instead of d20.  *   *&lt;strong&gt;Overload Chart&lt;/strong&gt;  **   **    &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &amp;lt;span 15px=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; baseline=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; calibri=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; none=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; normal=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; pre-wrap=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; style=&amp;quot;font-family: inherit;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;quot;&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &amp;lt;span 15px=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; baseline=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; calibri=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; none=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; normal=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; pre-wrap=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; style=&amp;quot;color: #d5a6bd; font-family: inherit;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; =&amp;quot;&amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;The hex dissolves into your flesh and seeps into your blood.

&lt;p&gt;**    &lt;em&gt;Casting Beyond Your Doom Points&lt;/em&gt;  When they can’t cast any more spells safely, Wizards may attempt to cast further spells with a 3d6 Cast the Bones roll.

One hand holding a staff is okay.  **   **    &lt;em&gt;Spell Effects&lt;/em&gt;  Spells normally have the same effect every time, as they have been recorded by generations of wizards in the safest and most effective way possible. But if the Wizard wishes, he can relax his hold on the spell and attempt a greater effect with a 3d6 Conduit of the Cosmos roll. The player announces what he wants to happen, and the Referee applies penalties accordingly. An effect without penalties would be something like double duration/damage.  **   **    Creativity should be encouraged, so if the Wizard spontaneously conceives of a way to use the fundamentals of a spell they know for a different purpose, they can attempt it with a Conduit of the Cosmos roll, taking penalties as the Referee sees fit, and bonuses up to +4 if it is significantly less powerful than the true spell.  **&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-11-06-new-to-me-blogs/ -&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Courtney Campbell&lt;/a&gt; recently solicited new OSR blogs on Google+, and man oh man did some good stuff come up.  Additionally, some old blogs that had long lain dormant have stirred from their slumber and revealed fabulous treasures.  I&amp;rsquo;ve added these to my blog list to the right (as much for my convenience as anything), but here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Dungeon of Signs&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Gloomtrain&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Goblin Punch&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/&#34;&gt;Last Gasp Grimoire&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;http://middenmurk.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Middenmurk&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&#34;http://rottenpulp.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Rotten Pulp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single one of these blogs is chock full of amazing content. To give you a hint, I&amp;rsquo;ve read through all of their archives in the last 4 or 5 days (okay, maybe I read through Middenmurk the week before).  I defy you to read though any one of these and &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; find something useful and/or interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I was reviewing my older posts, and I hate my writing with a fierce passion.  I&amp;rsquo;ll work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-28-seclusium-construction-worksheets/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OghZkfxHiLw/UfXb_r8QzEI/AAAAAAAAAU4/UP-hrHvV4zo/s1600/The-Seclusium-of-Orphone-210x300.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OghZkfxHiLw/UfXb_r8QzEI/AAAAAAAAAU4/UP-hrHvV4zo/s1600/The-Seclusium-of-Orphone-210x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Delightfully Vancian&lt;/em&gt;  *   *  [UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first off, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/117258/The-Seclusium-of-Orphone-of-the-Three-Visions?term=seclusium&#34;&gt;The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, if you&amp;rsquo;re not aware, is a new adventure/supplement/thing by D. Vincent Baker for use with Lamentations of the Flame Princess and other old school D&amp;amp;D and D&amp;amp;D-like games.  It is a step-by-step guide to creating a funky wizard&amp;rsquo;s tower in the tradition of Jack Vance, especially the Dying Earth and Lyonnesse.  It does a wonderful job of evoking that source material and is chock full of imaginative stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is a good spur to the imagination, but Zak Smith mentioned in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/07/quick-seclusium-of-orphone-review.html&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, and I agreed, that a good worksheet would help organize the process and make it more usable.  It turned out that more like 4+ worksheets were needed, but here they are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you find them useful and any suggestions for improvements, as these are a pretty rough.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planet of the Lost</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-25-planet-of-lost/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 19:14:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-25-planet-of-lost/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-25-planet-of-lost/ -&lt;p&gt;So, this is just a quick post on the alternate game we&amp;rsquo;ve now played for our last two sessions: Planet of the Lost.  The basic idea is that our characters were all on a flight from Nairobi to London and it crashed under mysterious circumstances in the desert.  We all figured we were in the Sahara at first, but it&amp;rsquo;s quickly becoming clear that something much weirder is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nK9RTR2q1nQ/UfHa9m0g2wI/AAAAAAAAAUg/QK8BPckeETI/s1600/lost_01.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nK9RTR2q1nQ/UfHa9m0g2wI/AAAAAAAAAUg/QK8BPckeETI/s1600/lost_01.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Apparently the whole crash survivors thing has been done before, I hear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules-wise, we&amp;rsquo;re starting out with the Generic Fuzion rules (influenced by their interpretation in Bubblegum Crisis, since that&amp;rsquo;s the version the GM and a few of us are most familiar with from a long-running high school campaign).  The GM (Caleb&amp;rsquo;s player in the Fellhold campaign) intends to house rule it as we go, very possibly converting to the highly modified descendant his brother (Bryni&amp;rsquo;s player) is developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fpsQGAHFTZE/UfHaH3cOWKI/AAAAAAAAAUU/ZAOHOJLPTFo/s1600/tumblr_mkyx6sSfkJ1r21i5xo1_500.jpg&#34;&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fpsQGAHFTZE/UfHaH3cOWKI/AAAAAAAAAUU/ZAOHOJLPTFo/s1600/tumblr_mkyx6sSfkJ1r21i5xo1_500.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Take out the Hot Chick Robo Suit Heroes, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool cyberpunk setting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing in a Fuzion game has been quite a big departure after months of refereeing original-ish D&amp;amp;D.  Point buy for stats and skills.  Picking &amp;ldquo;complications&amp;rdquo; to characterize my guy and to get more points.  Modern day real world assumptions. Good, but different.  I had to have some random injected into my creation process, so I ran through the BGC lifepath system and its ancestor, the Cyberpunk 2020 lifepath system.  BGC tended towards being more &amp;ldquo;coherent&amp;rdquo;, but Cyberpunk 2020 produced more gameable hooks to feed the GM (I ended up picking my favorite parts from both and applying them to the character concept that started forming in my head).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to a different play style is also taking some doing.  Our GM flat out told us that our first big fight against a giant lion and her giant cubs (so, normal lion sized) was being softballed for us, the PCs, but not for the faceless random passenger NPCs.  A fair amount of narrative exposition given as &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; but with a pre-determined outcome.  That&amp;rsquo;s okay, because our GM told us he was doing that to set the stage, but it&amp;rsquo;d be on us after that.  He&amp;rsquo;s also done a good job of creating adversity and reacting to the cues/hooks we&amp;rsquo;ve given him.  I flat out told him that I picked my complications to give him ways to screw with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that fight, though, following through on &amp;ldquo;this is what my guy would do&amp;rdquo; led to me being kind of boring and sucky.  He&amp;rsquo;s basically selfish except for being insanely protective of his younger brother (also on the flight and also a survivor, of course).  He got wounded in the crash, so when crazy giant lions showed up, I grabbed my brother and ran him into the intact part of the fuselage and hid.  Then the other characters and some NPCs killed the lions.  I probably should have done more to be awesome, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to the PC-Referee dynamic where it&amp;rsquo;s the ref&amp;rsquo;s job to throw out dangers and challenges and obstacles and it&amp;rsquo;s the PC&amp;rsquo;s job to circumvent them as efficiently and safely as possible.  I need to put my drama beret back on and more go for adding trouble in play (not just in character creation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, it&amp;rsquo;s fun so far, and it&amp;rsquo;s fun being on the &amp;ldquo;other side of the table&amp;rdquo; as it were. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t recap as in-depth since it&amp;rsquo;s not a record of &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; game, but I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely post anything interesting about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every Version of D&amp;amp;D&amp;rdquo; will continue when I finish reading through the OD&amp;amp;D supplements (on &amp;ldquo;Eldritch Wizardry&amp;rdquo; now, with &amp;ldquo;Deities, Demi-Gods, &amp;amp; Heroes&amp;rdquo; to follow, but I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten distracted by new releases and rewriting the Fellhold Rules).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Lifepath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rules&amp;rdquo; for this week are pretty light:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   ***   &lt;strong&gt;When playing in a Fuzion/Interlock game, get your hands on as many lifepath systems for character generation as you can.  Follow the procedure exactly for each one.  Then sit down, look at every version and combine them into the character that is most interesting to you.  Especially look for where you got different answers for the same topic or year and try to make every answer line up with the same event.  Bonus points if you can make everything in every path work together.&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fellhold Session 36 Recap</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-09-fellhold-session-36-recap/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 19:32:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-09-fellhold-session-36-recap/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-09-fellhold-session-36-recap/ -&lt;p&gt;Last night we wrapped up “Season 1” of Fellhold.  Not Season 1 in some pre-planned plot arc sense, heavens no! Rather, starting next week we’re switching to the new game I mentioned last time, and it just so happened that a lot of shit hit the fan this session and we ended at a good cliffhanger. Serendipitous!    &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPwn9_8hb-s/UdzEn8DreoI/AAAAAAAAASY/DgUJnxz4lw0/s1600/darksteel.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPwn9_8hb-s/UdzEn8DreoI/AAAAAAAAASY/DgUJnxz4lw0/s320/darksteel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, shit and fan hitting: we returned to Gurgu smashing pillars in his summoning area, most of the party hiding, and Bryni leading Bjergmund and a few priests and initiates down to see the “miracle” of Gurgu summoned, with the hopes of gently guiding them to the worship of Volsungr or some other proper god (but they figured Volsungr would be the best fit).  Varian tried to reestablish control by going back into line of sight, but Gurgu just kept smashing.  Unbeknownst to the players, Gurgu had always had a chance of going mad per round, but it hadn’t come up during the big fight with the trollkin and their beasts.  Unfortunately, it did come up while they were playing around with Gurgu to see that they could control him and coming up with their plan.  It was an insanely lucky coincidence that he went mad a) while they were having him smash stuff anyway, and b) right at the end of the last session.  So, Bjergmund and his priests see a rampaging Gurgu, and they rush into the main summoning area, beseeching him to spare them his wrath, professing their faith, and otherwise being model worshippers. Gurgu returned the favor by flinging chunks of the smashed pillars at them, crushing to death 4 initiates (teenagers, basically) and two of the priests.  Bjergmund was reduced to one hit point by sheer luck, and I decided he’d been pinned under rocks and his leg was broken.  There was a lot of dramatic “Gurgu nooooooo! Why have you forsaken meeeeeee ::squelch::” going on.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y6fftBzVzVs/UdzGJgr7IWI/AAAAAAAAASo/RVEoF2m7FGc/s1600/Lava_Elemental_Comic.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y6fftBzVzVs/UdzGJgr7IWI/AAAAAAAAASo/RVEoF2m7FGc/s320/Lava_Elemental_Comic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party shared a “Well, that went well” moment and then took a minute to figure out a plan of action.  Yllgrad charged the maddened lava being to distract it while Earn and Varian rushed to help Bjergmund and Bryni and his followers let fly with bows.  There was some speculation that the exposed gem might be a Zelda-like weak point, but the party unanimously agreed that there was no point to all this nonsense if they destroyed the Heart of the Mountain.    Yllgrad’s attack was ineffective, but Gurgu’s return blows were terrifically powerful.  His dwarvish protection against giant sized enemies likely saved his life, halving the damage taken.  Bryni and crew’s ranged attacks were mostly ineffective, except that his ranger follower scored a hit for a measly two damage. Fortunately, Earn and Varian managed to push the pillar fragments off of Bjergmund and get him to his feet.   llgrad figured he had done his part and proceeded to flee, straight up the path around the central shaft of the mountain.  Bjergmund directed Varian and Earn to help him in the other direction, and towards stairs up.  Gurgu turned and hurled more rocks in the direction of Bryni’s group and struck Dag for a tremendous amount of damage, but fortunately he’s as tough as Yllgrad and survived.  Bryni and his men decided to follow Yllgrad up and out of the mountain, while Gurgu pursued Varian, Earn and Bjergmund, trying to smash his way through archways and doors too small.  They slowed him down enough that everyone made it out of the temple safely, where they conferred.  Outside of the temple, they tried to sell a cockamamie story to Bjergmund that a “dark wizard” had summoned Gurgu for his own ends, and Gurgu had destroyed him in his wrath, but Bjergmund refused to believe that one of the unfaithful could summon Gurgu, and said that Gurgu must have manifested on his own to punish the sacrilege in his temple.  The group broke down and told him that they had summoned him, that anybody could, and that Gurgu wasn’t a god, just an elemental, that the library told them.  Again, Bjergmund refused to believe them and angrily headed for town.  In the town square, Bjergmund tried to stir up the people to ignore these foreign unbelievers and to come with him back to the temple to show their faith and beseech Gurgu to show mercy.  Bryni argued that such foolishness would just get everyone killed.  He brought up the fact that they had already risked their lives to save the village, and that they’d do it again.  In the end, his skills at inspiration and negotiation won out over Bjergmund’s position, and about 2/3 of the village agreed to evacuate to boats, under the direction of Oluf, the innkeeper.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AHg0SrhntX8/UdzG0iJvIfI/AAAAAAAAASw/83z8bjdTRKM/s1600/dar_priest.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AHg0SrhntX8/UdzG0iJvIfI/AAAAAAAAASw/83z8bjdTRKM/s320/dar_priest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think Bjergmund is quite this ugly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 1/3, however, including their seven children, began to follow Bjergmund up the mountain to placate Gurgu.  After some feeble attempts to sway them further, they called in Ash to cast sleep on the group, and it was very effective in downing most of the adults, including Bjergmund.  Bryni instructed Oluf to get them to safety while they came up with a plan for dealing with Gurgu. Right about then, a glowing, giant, angry form was seen leaving the temple entrance up on the mountain, and the island shook as smoke began to come from the top of the mountain and the usually sedate flow of lava out a tube in the side began to spurt and rush.  The group sent Ash, as the quickest and least encumbered (and being out of spells) to try to taunt Gurgu into following him as the group made their way up to the secondary entrance shown some of them after their initiation into the faith.  The plan was to lure Gurgu into the main pump room or the storage pool for the hot baths, and to hope that dousing him in enough water would cause him to be extinguished.  And so, with Gurgu chasing Ash up the mountain towards the shrine entrance, the rest of the party hoofing it for the secondary entrance, and the mountain shaking and spewing smoke, we called it an evening and will resolve their plan when we return to the Fellhold campaign.  As a quick refereeing note, it’s amazing how much easier it is to run things when one problem leads to another and everything is just falling apart.  I think it also helped that a lot of the prep I had done had had time to get engrained, so I knew how to react to the players without much deliberation.  After the game, though, I had a fairly long talk with Bryni’s player about the rules revisions I’m planning while Fellhold is on sabbatical, and we also talked about running games more generally.  I was interested to hear him say that in the very short (one session) game of Apocalypse World I ran for him and Caleb’s player in person, the NPCs had been way more interesting than any of them in this months long campaign.  I was struck, because at least at first, I tried to keep a lot of AW’s good NPC advice in mind as I ran, but the only thing I can figure is that in AW, especially in the first session, the NPCs are the main “moving part” the GM has to worry about.  In the Fellhold game, though, there are a lot of “moving parts” – treasure exchange rates, restocking the dungeon, coming up with adventure locations for the map, creating the city around the players, monster stats, running fights, et cetera, et cetera. Or maybe it’s just that running a much bigger group, and online at that, takes a lot more effort that saps my ability to make interesting NPCs. I’ll think on it some more.  Experimental Ranged Weapon Ammunition Rule  &lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_NCkNSVSSK8/UdzHmf06V_I/AAAAAAAAAS8/w48A9FbuC1o/s1600/300FC-00009.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_NCkNSVSSK8/UdzHmf06V_I/AAAAAAAAAS8/w48A9FbuC1o/s320/300FC-00009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a chance to try this out yet, and for all I know someone else has already invented it, but here’s a compromise between tracking every single arrow/bolt/bullet and just handwaving an infinite supply of ammo:  Characters with ranged weapons must buy ammunition “units” in order to operate their ranged weapon.  This might be a magazine, a clutch of arrows, or whatever.  The exact size isn’t important, but you can figure that out if you want.  Any time a character uses their ranged weapon, they roll an ammo saving throw.  Roll 1d20, add the number of ammo units purchased, and if the score is greater than or equal to 20, then they are fine.  If it is lower, they lose one unit of ammo.  When a character reaches zero ammo units, they are out of ammo and can no longer operate their ranged weapon.  You could have the saving throw be per round or after a complete combat, or only when you make a fumble or critical hit, or whenever seems like an appropriate frequency.  This is at least somewhat inspired by ammo checks in Necromunda, and it might be similar to how Dungeon World resolves things, but I can’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-03-every-version-of-d-part-iv-underworld/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dcS7-rcqCDs/UdOW3H2tqWI/AAAAAAAAAQk/d1GTH1gLK7E/s1600/Underworld&amp;amp;WildernessAdventures.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dcS7-rcqCDs/UdOW3H2tqWI/AAAAAAAAAQk/d1GTH1gLK7E/s320/Underworld&amp;amp;WildernessAdventures.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I come to the last of the original Little Brown Books, I have to give a bit of background.   When I was getting into D&amp;amp;D as an impatient and overconfident adolescent, I initially gave the DMG something of a pass.  It was actually the last of the core rulebooks I bought, and if I remember correctly, I ran my first campaign for quite a while without it.  I basically figured I knew what was up, and the Player’s Handbook had “the real rules” (a.k.a. character creation and combat).  By the time I did get around to reading the AD&amp;amp;D 2E DMG, while I found it awesome and inspiring, I viewed it very much as broad guidelines and figured I could safely ignore any specifics on how to go about things.  But that’s getting ahead of myself and this series by a huge number of posts.  My basic point is that I have held the misguided belief that DMGs are glorified advice handbooks for a very long time, and only in re-approaching D&amp;amp;D with a conscious attitude of using all the rules as presented until play makes changes necessary have I come to realize the full extent of my error.  And the first book to disabuse me of that notion was this little guy, “The Underworld and Wilderness Adventures”.  This book is &lt;em&gt;jam-packed&lt;/em&gt; with useful stuff.  It even seems to reverse my younger misapprehension: Men &amp;amp; Magic and Monsters &amp;amp; Treasure are mere reference works, whereas &lt;em&gt;the game&lt;/em&gt; is held in this book.  Here is where Gygax and Arneson were able to tell their wargaming audience “okay, we know this all sounded pretty much like the same stuff only with fantasy guys, but this right here is why this game is good and different.” &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; book is the nucleus around which all future D&amp;amp;D accreted and grew, despite the rules and description carry-over from the prior two.  It begins with the eminently practical advice on how to construct a dungeon. This game &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; “Dungeons and Dragons” after all.  What I really appreciate is the specificity and the granularity.  With later editions, there seems to be a growing sense of “you will use a module” or else “you know how to make a dungeon”.  As someone with the chutzpah to want almost entirely self-created dungeon content but without the years of experience in creating it, this is refreshingly welcome.  Tons of great blog posts have covered the finer points of dungeon creation, but definite rules on room placement and stocking, advice on how to draw those rooms and connect them up and so forth are all quite welcome.  I won’t dwell on some of the peculiarities better highlighted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grey-elf.com/philotomy.pdf&#34;&gt;Philotomy’s Musings&lt;/a&gt;, but doors that must be forced open and close automatically, changing monsters and passages when characters return, and infravision only working for monsters that live there all point to the dungeon as a tool for playing a fun game rather than a meticulously realized fictional world.  Given all of the later “Gygaxian Naturalism”, I have to wonder how much of this came from Gygax and how much from Arneson.  I’m sure more informed people than me will know.  Getting into the rules on monsters, I actually really like the wandering monster table as presented here.  I’d have to sit down and work out the probabilities, but I imagine later systems with normally distributed results could give a similar breakdown of monster level by level underground, but I feel like the breakout tables given here could very easily be tweaked by dungeon/megadungeon level/area to give a different feel for what high or low level monsters you encounter in any given area.  I also like that specific rules are given for avoiding and running away from monsters.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dJOJJJFJx38/UdObS_h7pYI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/4mpMSCLhVrU/s220/Monster+Plain.png&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dJOJJJFJx38/UdObS_h7pYI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/4mpMSCLhVrU/s220/Monster+Plain.png&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Get it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, moving into “The Wilderness” section, there’s a passage that catches my attention that I haven’t noticed before:   “Off-hand adventures in the wilderness are made on the OUTDOOR SURVIVAL playing board (explained below).  Exploratory journies[sic], such as expeditions to find land suitable for a castle or in search of some legendary treasure are handled in an entirely different manner.”  So, rather than “Outdoor Survival” being the ‘default’ immediate surroundings, does this imply that you should use that on the fly, but if you have time and effort you should come up with your own map and fit them together? That’s kind of cool.  I’ve gotta admit, the outdoor survival map just doesn’t hold the same appeal to me as it does for a lot of folks, though I can freely admit its usefulness, it looks a bit awkwardly artificial to my senses. Heresy, I’m sure, but there it is.  I initially found the rules about castles and their residents to be bizarrely specific and meddlesome, but re-reading, I notice that they’re set up to spur on adventure. Either you fight the residents of the castle (or run away) or they send you on a quest somewhere, or you have a sweet tournament and get a temporary base of operations.  In particular, I admire the ring of influence (encounter on 1-3 in hex, encounter on 1-2 1 hex away, encounter on a 1 2 hexes away) and I’ve seen a similar approach taken to monsters/adventure sites over on Rolls, Rules, and Roles here.  Because sandbox exploration is already so freeform and open, I really find mechanized processes especially helpful there.  The wilderness monster charts are enjoyably wacky.  I especially like that Burroughs’ Mars gets a shoutout as default terrain type.  And some great Old School advice:   “Animals will generally be of the giant variety, although the referee might prefer to have small spiders, for example, which attack the party when they are asleep.”  The evasion and wilderness encounter rules provide a nice cost to large parties for which I can definitely see the wisdom.  My group has a ridiculously huge entourage, and considering my setting is meant to be pretty sparsely inhabited, this means that they usually scare off any run of the mill wandering monsters and make chop suey out of most keyed encounters. Time to throw in some immune to normal weapons, level-draining undead, probably.  Or I could just follow rules like those given here so that there are real tactical and strategic choices to be made about rolling deep or rolling quiet.  I really like all of the stronghold and hireling/retainer rules.  When I first read about hirelings in 2E, the concept seemed kind of dumb, what with my being accustomed to the “heroic fantasy” flavor of D&amp;amp;D.  Now that I’m older and possibly wiser, the idea that the way your character becomes powerful on a different scale is to build a small empire is way more appealing to me than that your character gains demi-god-like or god-like powers and starts cruising the planes beating up cosmic forces or whatever.  I think I’ve said it before, but what I like best about this approach is that it inherently creates connection with the world.  If you want to build a stronghold, you have to find out about the area.  If you want allies and enemies, you have to know who is powerful.  If you want armies, you have to keep your peasants happy, which means you have to pay attention what’s going on in your domain, et cetera.  Adventurer, Conqueror, King System (ACKS) does a really super job of detailing all of this stuff in a workable system, but there’s plenty to work with right here in good ole “The Underworld and Wilderness Adventures”.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_auE0mPMGhk/UdObl1yeulI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Y2YCQz84K-s/s300/397_henchmen.jpg&#34;&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_auE0mPMGhk/UdObl1yeulI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/Y2YCQz84K-s/s300/397_henchmen.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ve got your back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aerial combat is fairly detailed, but I’ve honestly never run an aerial fight in any version of D&amp;amp;D.  Probably my loss.  I also haven’t ever used boats for more than getting from place to place, and I should probably fix that as well.  In general, as I mentioned above, I am pleasantly surprised by how much content is squeezed into such small space.  LotFP or ACKS or the like may have more clearly stated and easier referenced rules for running this sort of thing, but it’s all here in basic form for those willing to interpolate as necessary, and that’d pretty great.  The afterward is justly appreciated and well known in Old School circles, and I take its DIY ethos to heart.  I’d say it was no boast that all of the essentials are here in an ample framework, given everything that came after and was built on this sparse but sturdy frame.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we’ll do a quick survey of the Supplements (I-iV), which will be new to me, other than familiarity with references to them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fellhold Session 35 Recap</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-07-02-fellhold-session-35-recap/ -&lt;p&gt;Last night’s session was fairly short on game play, but what did happen seemed to go pretty well.  The reason gameplay was short was because we spent the first hour or so discussing what game to add to the rotation.  Fellhold will continue, but two weeks from today it will go on a hiatus while we play a new game for a while.  The thought is to keep anybody (myself included) from getting burned out or losing interest, and to enjoy other roleplaying games, cos why have just one?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18eHKqh95Kc/UdOVrjp8NpI/AAAAAAAAAQU/2shrDxfw6mA/s420/movies+dune+1984+kyle+maclachlan+dune+fremens+paul+muaddib+sting+singer+harkonnens+1920x1080+w_www.wallpaperno.com_72.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18eHKqh95Kc/UdOVrjp8NpI/AAAAAAAAAQU/2shrDxfw6mA/s320/movies+dune+1984+kyle+maclachlan+dune+fremens+paul+muaddib+sting+singer+harkonnens+1920x1080+w_www.wallpaperno.com_72.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;But do I want to be Twin Peaks, Sting, or Floating Fat Guy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitch we ended up settling on was from Caleb’s player, and the idea is that we are shipwrecked on a mysterious desert world.  He admitted to being largely inspired by what portion of Lost he has already seen (for our sake, I hope it’s only season one, maybe two), but it’s going to be sci-fi and with sand worms and the like.  The very close runner up was to return to a campaign from our youth (well, four of our youths, anyway) and play Bubblegum Crisis, with the same characters where relevant, but bringing in new blood.  Either would be a lot of fun, and we might come back to BGC later on, or lots of other options.  The other bonus to this set up is that everyone else can continue to game even when I’m not available, which will become especially relevant later this summer when I’ll be gone for two Mondays in a row.  With that settled, we got into Fellhold and picked up with more research, woo! This time their efforts were a little more focused, and they were able to determine the essentials of the elemental summoning circles throughout the temple.  They then examined the main summoning circle that brought forth Gurgu and determined that it was different from the others, but they couldn’t tell if it was different enough to summon a god.  Then they decided to try it out.  So they found their way into the treasure room of the temple, and besides the Heart of the Mountain, there was a whole lot of finery for the most holy of Gurgu ceremonies.  I described the clothes as basically “Volcano Pope”.  Their larcenous hearts were indeed fired by such rich goods (especially the Heart of the Mountain), but they decided these guys were super nice, and it would be pretty mean to rip them off, at least before finding out if their god was real.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JVvWxKbqPjE/UdOUpiVryHI/AAAAAAAAAQE/HUtc_oPFjP0/s416/pope-on-fire-3.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JVvWxKbqPjE/UdOUpiVryHI/AAAAAAAAAQE/HUtc_oPFjP0/s320/pope-on-fire-3.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Sort of like this, I guess?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, they took the Heart of the Mountain, performed the ceremony, and managed to succeed in summoning Gurgu! At which point they realized something was off.  They discovered that Gurgu responded to commands and did nothing else.  After Yllgrad’s “successful” exorcism of demons of madness that weren’t there, they had begun to suspect that they weren&amp;rsquo;t dealing with a genuine deity, but this confirmed in their minds that Gurgu is nothing more than a dumb elemental.  The group debated the merits of letting the villagers live in ignorance and bliss or trying to bring them on board with a real god, and if so, what level of deception to use.  The previous disaster of underestimating the faith of Odo the Sword Clan shaman was brought up, and it was decided that a certain degree of trickery was wise.  Having decided to dupe the good people of Bjergby out of worshipping what the party believes to be a false god, Varian kept control of Gurgu and started breaking things to provide hiding places while the others rushed up to the common areas of the priesthood to get everyone’s attention.  Caleb cast “cause light wounds” on himself and began “speaking in tongues” with the help of “Speak with Animals” to simulate extreme religious ecstasy.  Bryni called Bjergmund and the others to come see that there was a new prophet with a message direct from Gurgu.  Varian hid, so that he could play the puppeteer as Bryni, Caleb, and the others worked on convincing the priests that Gurgu was really an angel of Volsungr.  When they arrived at the lowest level, however, Varian commanded Gurgu to stop wrecking the place but he kept going breaking stuff. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Elemental Summoning Circle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the proper research and in a location of sufficient elemental intensity (volcanoes, seabeds, constant winds, et cetera), a summoning circle can be inscribed that will allow even people without magical talent to summon elemental beings of the proper type for the location. The circles must be crafted in some permanent fashion (such as metal inlaid in the floor, intricate carvings, poured glass, that kind of thing) and must be of high value (say, 500 GP per HD of elemental capable of being summoned, maybe more). Though the circles can be used by non-magic users, they must be created by a magic user and count as a lengthy and involved magical research process, even if the technique is already known, as each location&amp;rsquo;s unique energies must be taken into account and reflected in the design and empowering ritual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Every Version of D&amp;D Part III: Monsters and Treasure</title>

        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-28-every-version-of-d-part-iii-monsters/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-28-every-version-of-d-part-iii-monsters/ -&lt;h3 id=&#34;monsters-and-treasures--http2bpblogspotcom-epwinl8dhqqucuz3_hjpyiaaaaaaaaapchroxjxuogows320monsterstreasurepnghttp2bpblogspotcom-epwinl8dhqqucuz3_hjpyiaaaaaaaaapchroxjxuogows1600monsterstreasurepng&#34;&gt;Monsters and Treasures  &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-epWInL8DHQQ/Ucuz3_hjPYI/AAAAAAAAAPc/hROXJxUOgow/s1600/Monsters&amp;amp;Treasure.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-epWInL8DHQQ/Ucuz3_hjPYI/AAAAAAAAAPc/hROXJxUOgow/s320/Monsters&amp;amp;Treasure.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I’ve been writing other stuff for awhile now, and I’ve been neglectful of this little series of naked hubris.  So back to it with Monsters and Treasure, Volume 2 of OD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table that opens the book displays its wargame roots to me.  Monsters are presented here as a list, rather than as encyclopedia type entries that you see in the Monster Manual and onwards.  The former suggests a selection from which to choose, while the latter suggests reference material for something you&amp;rsquo;ve already chosen.  The entries look to be sorted roughly by category (undead are together, mean humanoids are together, foresty/fae type guys are together, et cetera).  It would have been handy for these to have been called out specifically, like we see in later “encounter by terrain” type tables, but the thought was already there. Finally, you’ve gotta admire the brevity of the “stat block” given.  It even makes S&amp;amp;W’s justly praised concise stats seem extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we see some assumptions that you’re familiar with Chainmail if you’re bothering to buy this game.  I have to wonder how much of this was just  carry over from the document starting out as “the fantasy supplement” to Chainmail that was never changed, and how much was because they assumed people buying this new product (D&amp;amp;D) would already be Chainmail fans (or was it a subtle way to try to “push” Chainmail?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we get into the actual monster descriptions, there are a few things I find interesting: men are given an extensive treatment compared to their treatment as “monsters” in later editions.  I think this is partly because later editions figure “we already told you how to make characters and NPCs, you can just do that for bad guys”, but I think it also reveals a preference for humans as the “default” opponent that was worn away in favor of monsters and humanoids in later versions.  It makes sense, considering the game started as “medieval battles (all humans) + monsters”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get into actual monsters, the brief descriptions focus entirely on “tactical” considerations, even if they are flavorful (“will attack dwarves on sight” and so on).  There are some interesting implicit “setting” details that come out, such as detailing goblin kings and that there are varied tribes of orcs, some in villages, some in caves.  Gnolls and Trolls get a little bit of pure flavor text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tradition of giving Dragons one of the most extended entries starts early and starts strong (they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in the title, after all).  The “attack/damage modifier by element type” table is interesting, I had forgotten it was there.  Are these retained in later versions, just spelled out on a by dragon basis? It’s kind of cool seeing it as a “system” of sorts.  Oh, and the “subduing dragons” section is one of my favorites from OD&amp;amp;D.  When I first found it, I couldn’t believe they had such specific rules spelled out for &lt;em&gt;dragons only&lt;/em&gt;.  This rule just screams “made up for a very specific event in play that became common place” rather than made up to be complete or to cover everything.  It’s also interesting that the dragons choice of attack is shown as being diced for, rather than decided by the referee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4BrbvKLuXBA/Uc5J5nok3bI/AAAAAAAAAPw/io8hmXJPzuQ/s1111/dragon_queen_by_scarypet-d5huufb.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4BrbvKLuXBA/Uc5J5nok3bI/AAAAAAAAAPw/io8hmXJPzuQ/s320/dragon_queen_by_scarypet-d5huufb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s one way to subdue a dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, for such a tiny booklet, it is surprising to me how complete the monster list is.  So many monsters that became staples of D&amp;amp;D are right there.  It’s pretty admirable, really.  Sure, the AD&amp;amp;D 2E Monstrous Manual was probably the very first gaming book I ever bought from a store (the PHB I got from a friend), and it is a lovely and inspirational book, but as with the rest of OD&amp;amp;D, the terse entries presuppose that I can handle detailing stuff and making it interesting myself, and just give me some help on the stats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as for the Treasure section, I’ve gotta say, the tables make my eyes cross a little bit.  I’m sure there’s all sorts of interesting stuff to be gleaned by examining the probabilities of different outcomes, and I’m sure it supports the whole “dice tell you what the world is like” mindset that I find it useful to cultivate as a referee, but I can’t perform that analysis right now.  My own preferences for rare magic items have led me to using other systems, though perhaps I should re-evaluate the assumptions in the tables about rate of reward to challenge, since I feel like I’ve gotten off on that in my own game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic sword section is pleasingly detailed and insane.  It’s pretty obvious that Gygax and Arneson (or their friends) had Stormbringer in mind for a lot of the design here.  It’s also surprising that magic swords get so much treatment when they’re not super rare by the treasure tables (I think; again, no in-depth analysis here).  Perhaps this was an early attempt at a solution to “but what makes fighters special as they level up?” Though the Egoism rules suggest an attempt at also building in “but how to keep low level fighters from getting too powerful too quick by one lucky treasure break”. That’s a problem I’m facing right now in my game, so it wouldn’t surprise me if it’s been there from the get go at least for some folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the magic items, there is a similar familiarity as seen with monsters, but in this case it is less pleasing to me.  This list gives the impression of “here’s some wacky stuff we thought up either because it would be fun/weird, because it was in a story we read, or because it came up in play that it would make sense.” Or at least, that&amp;rsquo;s how the list comes across if I force myself not to read it as “standard D&amp;amp;D magic items”.  Because all of these became the assumed default magic items, and time changed them from a list of examples to a list of assumptions to a list of guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OJ3lrEA52Pk/Uc5Khg4-ouI/AAAAAAAAAP4/5sJZraUihL8/s350/designdev_magic2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OJ3lrEA52Pk/Uc5Khg4-ouI/AAAAAAAAAP4/5sJZraUihL8/s320/designdev_magic2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Ye Olde Magical Boot Shoppe.  What is this, Diagon Alley?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper coins are worth a little more, 1/50&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;gold, rather than 1/500&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.  Interesting.  Oh, and I’ve been doing some research for encumbrance rules, and it turns out that 10 coins to the pound isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; crazy – for &lt;strong&gt;silver&lt;/strong&gt;.  Gold coins were way lighter than silver coins, because the metal was worth so much more, people made much smaller, thinner coins.  I’m finding the “silver standard” of games like LotFP to make more and more sense.  Plus it adds the chance to make the default coin the heaviest and hardest to transport, hah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that was pretty rambly.  Next up we’ll conclude the original White Box with “The Underworld and Wilderness Adventures”, with the Supplements to follow (I may jam them all into one less detailed entry).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-26-fellhold-session-34-recap-and/ -&lt;p&gt;Research, research, research.  This session was pretty much entirely the players using the library in the Fyrberg temple to try to find out more about the history of Gurgu, Gurguism, and the complex in the mountain.  It dragged a little, as everyone was researching different stuff, and I had to narrate results of their researches to each person individually.  Also, describing what you’ve read in ancient texts isn’t always the most interesting experience.  But overall I think the players got some useful info, overlooked some useful stuff as unimportant, and came up with some sharp observations on the improved information they found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iRkVxG1kcc0/UcugA1Zi3OI/AAAAAAAAAO4/3oD8Bgbu6ls/s1600/AlexLibtexts.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iRkVxG1kcc0/UcugA1Zi3OI/AAAAAAAAAO4/3oD8Bgbu6ls/s320/AlexLibtexts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;But with more clay tablets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their researching, they found that a wizard (they still haven’t found his name) became obsessed with immortality (nothing new there) and that he decided the elemental power of fire was the key to it.  Hence his volcano lair.  Yllgrad the dwarf found a number of dwarven texts giving more information on Fellhold, as well as the excavation and waterworks of Fyrberg.  The players discovered that the ornate summoning circles in the floor in sections of the temple allow people with little to no magical ability to summon elemental beings, but that such circles only work in nodes closely connected to an elemental plane (like a volcano, an oceanic trench, deep in a mountain, et cetera).  This wizard kind of glossed over all of the non-fire ones. He also had researched extensively binding elemental forces into physical objects in his quest for extended life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the religion of Gurgu (these writings were more recent, and therefore in a language that everyone could read, not just the hyper-literate Bryni), they found out a few things.  They discovered that the original prophet of Gurgu was a man named Nar, and that he preached all the stuff the party has already come to know about Gurgu (cleanse the mind, body, and spirit, the fires of the world are the primordial life force, et cetera).  They discovered that he was denounced by a man named Klog, finding both an anti-Gurgu screed by Klog and a religious document detailing their conflict.  The screed claimed that Gurgu was a dumb elemental and that Nar was a fake.  The religious text claimed that Klog was a wicked man who refused to accept the knowledge and power of Gurgu and tried to kill Nar in his jealousy.  But Nar summoned Gurgu’s avatar, who cast Klog into the Fyrberg, where his spirit could be cleansed and become one with the fires of Gurgu, despite his unbelief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the research, Sir Varian decided to throw the town a victory feast, and somehow in the celebration (thanks to Jeff Rients’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://jrients.blogspot.com/2011/09/carousing-in-wessex.html&#34;&gt;excellent carousing table&lt;/a&gt;) he ended up getting inducted into the priesthood of Gurgu.  Not just a member of the church like the others, but an actual initiate.  We’ll see how that shakes out.  The rest of the group is starting to suspect that Gurgu might not be a god at all, but just a big lava elemental.  They’re debating how and if to reveal it to his followers to disabuse them of their false ways, and afterwards either returning to Mickleheim or taking advantage of the extension they purchased from their ship’s captains to go check out some mysterious coastal ruins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-23Vau6lZ7f8/UcugxV_siCI/AAAAAAAAAPA/LDvjDhpG3fg/s1600/the-village-festival-jean-charles-meissonier.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-23Vau6lZ7f8/UcugxV_siCI/AAAAAAAAAPA/LDvjDhpG3fg/s320/the-village-festival-jean-charles-meissonier.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Our first carousing mishap, woohoo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, after the game we discussed adding some more games to our rotation once we reach a good stopping point.  I’ve been itching to be a player in something, but I wanted to make sure we got some of the slow burn enjoyment out of an ongoing campaign.  Hopefully a rotation will allow each game to be enjoyed maximally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Further Optional Library Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should probably start with the library rules found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_reviews.php?products_id=91110&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;Vornheim Complete City Kit&lt;/a&gt; because they are awesome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  ***   ***  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;ve, say, sorted your library into topics and the players are trying to find out about specific subjects that the library has a reasonable chance of covering, then use the following rules to supplement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  ***   ***  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Anything that can reasonably be found with enough time and effort that the players can read, just tell them.  D&amp;amp;D probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be about complex research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) That being said, if time and/or effort are limited, if some characters have more ability than others, or if information within the library might be hidden or obscure, do the following:   - Pick a period of time based on the size and complexity of the library or physical area being searched&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Each player searching for that time period rolls 1d20 per language applicable to that section that they know. Consider adding another die if the character has established they are particularly good at scholarly pursuits or if they are a magic user&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  ***- If they roll equal to or under their intelligence, they learn something useful.  Consider adjusting how useful based on how much they pass the test by, but keep in mind point 1) above.  ***  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Make sure to take into account any smart strategies the players come up with to maximize success.  The only reason we&amp;rsquo;re rolling for stuff is if it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to have a chance of using up resources and making meaningful decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) If a player passes an intelligence test, but they specified they were looking into stuff not relevant to the overall purpose, then make sure they find something potentially useful or interesting that would make sense to be in this library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) If the library contains any spellbooks or scrolls and is searched by someone who could know, like a magic user, and they specify that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for, follow the procedure above, and then determine the number and composition of spells.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything specific in mind, roll 1d6 for level and the closest die size for number of spells in a spell level to randomly determine spells.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review of &#34;Better than Any Man&#34; and Mercenary Group Recruitment</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-19-review-of-than-any-man-and-mercenary/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:29:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-19-review-of-than-any-man-and-mercenary/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-19-review-of-than-any-man-and-mercenary/ -&lt;p&gt;So, after my enthusiastic blurb the other day, I figured “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939191852/lotfp-2013-free-rpg-day-adventure&#34;&gt;Better than Any Man&lt;/a&gt;” warranted a full review after I finished reading it last night. So, here that review is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/better-than-any-man-safe-pr.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/better-than-any-man-safe-pr.jpg?w=211&#34; alt=&#34;Better-Than-Any-Man-SAFE-pr&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, for those that might not know, what is “Better than Any Man” (hereafter referred to as BTAM)?  BTAM is a meaty adventure/mini-sandbox written by James Raggi for his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/products&#34;&gt;Lamentations of the Flame Princess Adventures line&lt;/a&gt; and specifically for “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freerpgday.com/&#34;&gt;Free RPG Day 2013&lt;/a&gt;”.  It intentionally flies in the face of the Free RPG Day guidelines, and is about 1000 times better on account of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those odd few not familiar with Raggi, he does a better job establishing what he’s about than I ever could, so allow me to quote from his “Author’s Notes” to set the tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&amp;ldquo;Welcome to LotFP&amp;rsquo;s Free RPG Day adventure! It isn&amp;rsquo;t what it is supposed to be. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were told &amp;ldquo;Include quickstarter rules!&amp;rdquo; We were advised to create a short introductory/teaser adventure.  We were warned to make it suitable for all audiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do that. You know why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is the amount of fucks we give about what we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to have made the drive to the Friendly Not-Quite Local Game Store to pick this up after having read just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I get into the adventure itself, let me clarify my relationship as a referee to Raggi’s work.  Honestly, I find most of his stuff too weird/horrific/game-changing to want to include it in my regular campaign as is.  That being said, I’d say that his published adventures are possibly the most useful I’ve bought because they force me to think in different ways and expose me to fantastically weird ideas I would never have on my own. Also, Raggi’s style of adventures and excellent referee advice in Lamentations of the Flame Princess: Weird Fantasy Roleplaying (LotFP) have helped me develop the crucial referee skill of not softballing my players.  Sometimes you gotta pull the trigger, and sometimes that trigger is a save or die trap.  While I’ve wholesale lifted more material from adventures by others (Gygax, Matt Finch, and so forth), Raggi’s stuff has done far more to push me out of my referee comfort zone, and that’s all to the good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way, let’s talk about BTAM itself, cos that’s why you’re here, right? As mentioned, this thing is &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;.  96 pages in an A5 format, with teeny double column text, so there’s a lot of content there.  A lot a lot of content.  New monsters, spells, some seriously creepy NPCs, a fully statted out town, half a dozen sketched out towns, each with something of interest mentioned, something like 5 mapped and keyed adventure locations, even some surprisingly compact and functional firearms rules squeezed into a box in a corner. Oh yeah, and one hell of a time pressure creator in the form of the Swedish Army behind King Gustavus Adolphus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/220px-gustav_ii_of_sweden.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/220px-gustav_ii_of_sweden.jpg?w=218&#34; alt=&#34;220px-Gustav_II_of_Sweden&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been checking out Raggi’s recent stuff, this whole “Swedish” and “Firearms” business is probably freaking you out.  From the get go, LotFP has had a decidedly early modern flavor, but Raggi’s been pushing it even more recently, and has even taken to writing most of his material for the real world.  Initially I found this extremely off-putting.  Like, “why would I even buy that?” off-putting. After reading some positive reviews, and thinking about, and letting an extant interest in the early modern period percolate some more, though, I’ve come around.  Here’s the rationale: A) It’s super easy to translate real-world stuff into fantasy equivalents if you want to, since that’s where about 90% of fantasy content comes from anyway, B) as a game with a horror focus, it is a cheap but super effective short cut to create the necessary “grounding” to contrast with the real horror, C) All of that boring background and setting detailing &lt;em&gt;is totally already done and available&lt;/em&gt; and D) It turns out the early modern period is a pretty good fit for standard D&amp;amp;D assumptions: lots of war, small, scattered states, superstition and magic, vast unexplored tracts of land peopled by dangerous intelligent humanoids (in this case actual humans), and even professional adventurers who do nothing but travel the world looking for ways to get valuable through violence and craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I’ve gone from finding the idea of a historical early modern game of D&amp;amp;D completely awful to finding it extremely compelling.  I’m way more likely to incorporate early modern elements into some other fantasy world, but I would actually consider running a historical game at this point. BTAM is the product that actually convinced me of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, good Lord am I talking about a lot of tangential stuff and not the adventure itself.  So, the cover of the adventure is not attached, and inside of it is a lovely color map showing the keyed locations and the surrounding terrain.  It depicts a part of Lower Franconia (Holy Roman Empire = crazy confusing.  Just think “basically Germany” for now) that may or may not be geographically accurate, I don’t know.  But there’s plenty or space to wander around in, some really high quality random wilderness encounters, and the seeds of ideas for some of the less-detailed towns.  The adventure has a fair number of these “you make it up, you’re the referee!” which I think is pretty great.  I mean, I’m so unlikely to run the adventure “straight” as is, that the prospect of embellishing some other things on my own is no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The items and spells have the typical Raggi flavor of “serious consequences for magic use”.  I found more of these to be potentially actually useful rather than straight up “you are screwed for even considering using magic, dummy”, which some of the magic items I’ve seen in his adventures previously come across as (I’m looking at you, everything from Devan’ku). In this adventure, I think the consequences are either rare enough or live-withable enough to instead present a compelling picture of “magic has a cost, but it works”.  There’s still the odd screw job to remind players that it really is kind of shitty to rob graves and callously kill everybody and steal things, but overall, it’s a little more adventure and a little less “we’re here to see how much awful stuff you will do/put up with”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTAM also does an admirable job of setting up a few “reveals” without having a “plot” per se.  This is done by seeding bits of information in different locations, such that no matter how you approach them, you’ll get a slowly growing picture of what’s going on, rather than requiring specific clues or investigative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, BTAM possesses a quality I’ve been thinking about a lot lately, and that is modularity.  Now, I don’t mean in the sense that the whole adventure is a module you can drop in to any campaign world with minimal fuss (though it’s pretty decent for that too, if you can substitute in an appropriate invading army).  What I mean is that each element is highly useful by itself.  The elements fit together into an interesting and flavorful whole, with lots of links, but you don’t have to use all of them to use any of them.  The spells given could be found in any suitably creepy wizard’s spellbook.  The Shrine to the Insect God could go just about anywhere, the town of Karlstadt and its unique rulership could be dropped into most places, the monsters could appear on their own, et cetera.  So BTAM, besides being an interesting and well done adventure is also a pretty jam-packed toolkit.  I would venture that just about any referee/GM/DM/whatever will find at least one thing they would like to use in their game unchanged, and at least a dozen more that might take some minor tweaking, and who knows how much that serves as rough inspiration for something pretty different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: if you weren’t lucky enough to get a backer copy for kickstarting this (like me) or to pick one up at Free RPG Day (unlike me) totally buy the PDF when it comes out.  Raggi has mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/112262093672917983853/posts/bPZMtmKPJPX&#34;&gt;on Google+&lt;/a&gt; that it will feature some upgrades (more printer and e-reader friendly, “loosened up” layout, stuff like that).  And don’t forget that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/115059/LotFP-Rules-%26-Magic-Free-Version&#34;&gt;complete LotFP rules&lt;/a&gt; are available without art for free from RPGNow.  Even if you aren’t into the weird fantasy/horrific angle, they’re a pretty robust version of D&amp;amp;D with some good encumbrance and wilderness/overseas travel rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 5/5 – Enthusiastic Recommendation, especially if you don’t think you’d like it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting Groups of Mercenaries for an expedition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the first installment (well, second if you count the mass combat rules) of the modular rules I&amp;rsquo;m developing for an adventuring company expedition set of rules.  The idea is that you can plug it into a lot of different systems, or use the whole thing as its own setting/game variant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you hire a group of otherwise nondescript mercenaries for an expedition, you can use one of the following options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Randomly generate each and every individual and keep track of them as separate hirelings, as you would for any standard adventure. This works best with normal sized expeditions (say, no more than 1o or 12, and when a high level of detail in play is desired) where all players are together, so that a lot of detail isn&amp;rsquo;t leaving anybody out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Treat the group of hirelings/mercenaries as one &amp;ldquo;individual&amp;rdquo;.  For the sake of ease, every ability score is equal to 8+1d4 (these are thoroughly average people), but randomly determine one ability and add 1d6 to it for every 6 members of the group (there&amp;rsquo;s one exceptional individual).  HP are equal to the number of members&amp;rsquo; HD, and all members must be equipped identically.  If using a skill system of some sort, give the group one advance past starting, but otherwise consider it to have default levels.  Additional advances can be bought using whatever system is appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Use a skirmish rules system of your choice to keep track of groups of mercenaries/hirelings (Mordheim is a natural choice as it was a large inspiration for these rules in the first place)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free RPG Day</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-16-free-rpg-day/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 13:47:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-16-free-rpg-day/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-16-free-rpg-day/ -&lt;p&gt;So, yesterday was &amp;ldquo;Free RPG Day&amp;rdquo;.  For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, participating game stores buy boxes from the Free RPG Day organizers which are chock full of free game material.  Usually this consists of one-off adventures, quick start versions of rules, that kind of thing.  And for Castles &amp;amp; Crusades, Dungeon Crawl Classics, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, that is precisely what I got (there were some others, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to grab stuff just for the sake of grabbing stuff when other people might get more use out of it).  But this year had the totally awesome not-quick-start, not-all-ages-appropriate &amp;ldquo;Better than Any Man&amp;rdquo; by James Raggi from his own &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/&#34;&gt;Lamentations of the Flame Princess&lt;/a&gt; line of adventures.  It&amp;rsquo;s like a mini-campaign setting (Lower Franconia being invaded by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus - yes, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a historical setting, just like &amp;ldquo;The God That Crawls&amp;rdquo;).  I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through reading it now, and it is awesome.  Tons of disturbing content, chock full of Raggi&amp;rsquo;s signature &amp;ldquo;not just kill your characters, but fundamentally alter them and/or the world&amp;rdquo; spells and encounters.  Much like &amp;ldquo;The God That Crawls&amp;rdquo; I will personally most likely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; follow Raggi&amp;rsquo;s advice from the referee book in the Grindhouse edition of LotFP - which is to make only the tweaks necessary to make an adventure fit in your world and then nothing else - because, well, I&amp;rsquo;m just not that mean.   But I like to include some of his stuff to force myself to play for keeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/better-than-any-man-safe-pr.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/better-than-any-man-safe-pr.jpg?w=211&#34; alt=&#34;Better-Than-Any-Man-SAFE-pr&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were not lucky enough to have a participating local game store, or to make it to one, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lotfp.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mr. Raggi&lt;/a&gt; plans to have a few leftovers available for cheap from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/&#34;&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt; soon.  Or you could talk to some people who maybe did get their hands on one.  And once the exclusivity of getting one at Free RPG Day wears off, I think he&amp;rsquo;s talked about making a PDF version available for sale.  If so, I super recommend you get it. Really just ridiculous how much good stuff is packed in there &lt;em&gt;for free&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s bigger than all previous LotFP adventures, so it&amp;rsquo;s easily worth 15-20 bucks print and 5-10 pdf.  And that&amp;rsquo;s a low-ball.  He could probably ask for more and it&amp;rsquo;d be worth it.  So, sorry to gush, but it&amp;rsquo;s good, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting, and you should try to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fellhold Session 32 and 33 Recap and Quick and Dirty Mass Combat Rules</title>
        <link>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-11-fellhold-session-32-and-33-recap-and/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-06-11-fellhold-session-32-and-33-recap-and/ -&lt;p&gt;Session 32 started out with a lot of technical issues for everyone participating.  I suspect it had to do with the changes Google had just made to the hangouts/video chat format.  Speaking of which, I miss my posts about hangouts displaying the name of the video chat, because that was the primary way I reminded myself what session number we were on for the blog.  Oh well, being able to count should be good enough for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player characters decided to spend the night in Bjergby and then ask the priests about using their library in the morning.  They want to learn more about the history of Gurgu and confirm or reject some of the rumors they picked up in Mickleheim.  Their sleep was interrupted by the innkeeper pounding on their door, however.  Priests had run down from the temple to fetch the adventurers because they remembered Yllgrad the dwarf’s boasting about killing many foul beasts, and their temple was under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this set up &lt;em&gt;smacks&lt;/em&gt; of being set up for the PCs benefits, right in the same vein as “then ninjas pop out!”, but here’s the God’s honest truth: okay, yes, having an attack from monsters from outside was thought up to make the location more of an “adventure”, and only came up because the players ended up visiting this place, so in that sense it’s “plotted”. But after deciding that bugbears from the deep would be an adventure element, their actions have been determined either independently or in reaction to the players.  I randomly determined a number of days until the bugbears planned to attack, and then decided that they had a spy on the island, and if the players said or did certain things in front of the spy, they would push their timetable up.  Turns out their scheduled attack was at 5:00 in the morning of this day.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/fellholdbugbear.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/fellholdbugbear.jpg?w=250&#34; alt=&#34;fellholdbugbear&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks Tony Diterlizzi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the players decided that if they help out the priests, maybe they’ll give them access to the temple in gratitude, and they occasionally have vague senses of doing the right thing.  When they show up, they are lead to the bottom two floors of the temple, and they are attacked with crossbow bolts out of patches of unnatural darkness! Yllgrad’s faithful hireling Nyllan is struck and falls headlong into the lava, bringing with him most of Yllgrad’s adventuring gear besides his armor and weapon! The adventurers charge into the darkness and find themselves fighting blind against trollkin (a bugbear and his hobgoblin slaves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They manage to dispatch the hobgoblins pretty quickly, with the help of Sir Braxton, Caleb’s dog, and a few lucky critical hits.  The bugbear takes some serious damage and decides to flee.  The party presses on to fight another similar group with similar results, except this bugbear throws sleep gas grenades before fleeing (thanks to a suggestion on Google+ for the idea for using noxious fumes, which lead to the sleep gas grenade idea).  It puts Sir Braxton, a hireling, and Caleb to sleep, along with the lone surviving hobgoblin slave.  The party ties him up for questioning before moving on to the large melee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, as all of this has been going on, the main force of Bugbears, Hobgoblins, Trolls, and lightning lizards have been facing off against the priests and their summoned elemental.  Then they also summoned the avatar of Gurgu, and it pretty much went against the bugbears and their slaves after that.  The players’ ranged characters and henchmen contributed by picking off some leadership and killing two of the lightning lizards.  Being hard pressed, the bugbears retreated, leaving the enraged trolls and lightning lizards fighting. They threw sleep grenades, which promptly knocked out every single priest.  Fortunately, the elemental did not go out of control and kept the trolls busy, but Gurgu just stood there without direction from the priests.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/lava_fight_color_by_iquorek.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/lava_fight_color_by_iquorek.png?w=216&#34; alt=&#34;Lava_fight_color_by_iquorek&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the players got there, the trolls had fled in the face of so much non-regenerating damage, and they helped Bjergmund clear the whole complex, thereby getting something of a tour.  During this clearing, they found a collapsed newly dug tunnel that was the apparent retreat point of the Bugbears and their forces.  Bjergmund also answered some questions about the temple and Gurgu, confirming that the temple was built by a wizard before Gurgu was worshipped, and that he selected it so that his library of clay tablets would be in hot, dry air.  For their help in defending the temple, the PCs were all offered free lifetime access to the baths, the chest containing the offerings  of the faithful, and a chest with fancy vestements, which the party gratefully accepted.  We had to end somewhat early due to a number of early appointments, and the party decided that next time they will seek out any alternative landing places on the island to confirm that the monsters really did come from deep under the earth and to go through the library to research Gurgu. If they complete that, they will return to Mickleheim to sell some loot and refit for future adventures.    ***&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ninjaix5.jpg&#34;&gt;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ninjaix5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick and Dirty Mass Combat Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative 1 (slightly more concrete): Treat each side as a “character”.  Assign AC, HD, HP and morale based on the overall characteristics of the side (something like 1 HP per 1 HD monster/character is probably reasonable).  When players are not involved, each side fights as if a one on one fight.  Determine initiative normally and go from there.  If players get involved, have them make attacks on the side as if against a single character if they’re indiscriminate, or if they target someone in particular (like a leader) “zoom in” and alter the side’s “character” appropriately.  For example, if they kill a 3HD leader guy, deduct 3 HP from the side as a whole, and maybe test morale. Without other special circumstances (leaders killed, horrifying magic, et cetera) start testing morale after ¼ or ½ HP damage are taken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative 2 (more abstract and potentially more swingy): Assign each side a base morale value and a morale bonus or penalty.  Each combat round, roll a d20 for each side, and the higher roll wins that round.  Deduct a point from the losing side’s morale bonus (or increase the penalty by 1).  Test morale every round.  When one side fails a morale check, it flees.  Alter the morale modifiers appropriately for character actions (deduct points when they kill leaders or big monsters, add points when they rally the troops or lead a charge, whatever). This tends to assume fairly evenly matched forces, but if you want one side to have way better fighting ability, you can always modify the vs. d20 roll, or use Alternative 1 above.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative 3 (most concrete): Roll up lots of creatures/characters.  Roll initiative.  Have a big ass fight with the normal rules.  Take careful notes to avoid going insane.  Budget a lot of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morale Rolls: For these rules, a morale roll of 2d6 attempting  to roll under modified morale score is assumed.  Morale scores range from 2 (totally cowardly) to 12 (fanatically loyal).  Basic humans/humanoids with a normal stake in a fight can be assumed to be morale 7. A natural 2 always passes, and a natural 12 always fails.  Note that a modifier of +3 or greater will almost guarantee passing these rolls for Morale of 7 or greater.  If you have a different preferred morale system, go with that, but a 2 or more dice roll is recommended, so that you will have a normal distribution with most results clustering around the average (7) +/- 1 or 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RPG May Blog Carnival: Campaigns I&#39;d Like to Run</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-28-rpg-may-blog-carnival-campaigns-i-like/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ageofravens.blogspot.com/2013/05/campaigns-id-like-to-run-rpg-blog.html&#34;&gt;First Time Blog Carnival Participation&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of participating in the RPG Blog Carnival for May, I thought I’d jump in with talking about campaigns I’d like to run, and man, are there a lot.  Unfortunately, probably a lot more than I’ll ever get to, but that’s just the way of things.  So, to impose some structure on my excessive campaign desires, I am going to give an example for each suggested facet of the topic from the introductory post to this Month’s carnival.  Let’s get to it, shall we?     &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/marienburg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/marienburg.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Marienburg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Campaign Pitches:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, first of all, this is a game that I probably want to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; in more than I want to run it, but I’ll take what I can get.  I was recently reading the archives at Monsters &amp;amp; Manuals and saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2008/10/great-blog-posts-and-lessons-of-history.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; talking about Conquistador companies and it reminded me of something I’ve been thinking about for a while, probably originally inspired by Penny Arcade’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4pod/20080530&#34;&gt;Acquisitions Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;.  I want a game with a fairly advanced, slightly cosmopolitan setting, more late medieval to early renaissance than my usual preferred early dark ages.  Something more like Warhammer’s Old World (especially Marienburg) or Waterdeep.  But this is not a game of citycrawling or courtly intrigue.  Oh no.  This is a game of expeditions into dangerous wilderness and ruins for glory and wealth.  Mostly wealth.  There’s something interesting to me in the idea of taking an explicitly anachronistic, even banal attitude to a fantasy world.  So, adventurers would actually be professional adventurers, formed into companies with shares spelled out in contracts, clauses regarding funeral arrangements, business plans, et cetera.  I wouldn’t want to tip entirely into parody, but something about &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/03/playing-monopoly-with-squatters.html?zx=1fe40e191d1fc7f8&#34;&gt;the inherent irony&lt;/a&gt; of the juxtaposition of real world, modern approaches to fantastical, mythical things would be fun.  In the background would be a “kitchen sink” fantasy setting with the cliché elves and dwarves and halflings and humans and whoever living in one multicultural empire, “magic as technology” would make an appearance despite (because of?) my usual distaste for it, and many of the ridiculous rationalizing of D&amp;amp;D tropes that occurred in late 2E would be fully embraced.  To balance this, the actual expeditions would be insanely, nightmarishly lethal, and the only viable option for success would be thorough preparation and lateral thinking.  I think a DCCRPG style funnel approach would be especially fitting, and would make sense with players in the role of “expedition managers” with a stable of recruits.  All of this is even more amusing to me now that I’m in business school.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/03_16_10.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/03_16_10.jpg?w=200&#34; alt=&#34;03_16_10&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems or Settings of Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; I really want to run Burning Wheel some time.  Reading the rules got me all hot and bothered, and the emotional mechanics for elves and dwarves just really &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; Tolkien style elves and dwarves in a way that I would love to see in action. I don’t know if they lead to those characterizations working in play, but reading them definitely conjures up exactly the right feel.  At one point I actually said “If I ever run D&amp;amp;D again, I want to do it with Burning Wheel.”  Obviously I was foolish and wrong, but I would amend that to “If I ever want to run a high-drama epic fantasy game focused on character motivations, I want to run Burning Wheel.”  But secretly, I might want to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; Burning Wheel even more than I want to run it.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tumblr_lns8bwjsal1qhttpto1_r2_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tumblr_lns8bwjsal1qhttpto1_r2_1280.jpg?w=252&#34; alt=&#34;tumblr_lns8bwJSAl1qhttpto1_r2_1280&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamemastered in a Particular Style:&lt;/strong&gt; So, obviously I’d really like to run my own damn game “&lt;em&gt;Book of Threes&lt;/em&gt;”.  A few things have held this up: getting more into “Old School” gaming than indie gaming recently, having an actual game to play instead of just amusing myself with design, and stalling out on what exactly the point of play for this game is.  So, I’ve got a great idea of the ‘feel’ I want to go for, and some notions I’ve borrowed from indie games on how to set up tense interpersonal relationships, but I feel like the game lacks a driving “this is what you do in this game” impetus for players to fall back on.  I need to figure that out, and then figure out how to tweak the game mastering rules (which are mostly a modification of the Apocalypse World game master rules) to reflect that. And since I’ve been so focused on Fellhold, that’s been way on the backburner for awhile.  But I’d still like to work it out and get that game finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/fanfic5.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/fanfic5.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;fanfic5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;em&gt;Dream Team: Hahah, just kidding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Particular Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; I lucked out and got most of my RPG group “dream team” into the Fellhold game.  That being said, I have a few friends that I would specifically like to get together for some hippie indie gaming with themes and shit. And some other friends I’d like to play something openly competitive and tactical.  There’s some overlap there, of course, but I know some play styles and games just aren’t gonna do much for some people.****    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/nemo_sketch_in_pen_by_noelle_chan.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/nemo_sketch_in_pen_by_noelle_chan.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Nemo_sketch_in_pen_by_noelle_chan&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists:&lt;/strong&gt; Monastic warriors; Sikhs; Desert Nomads; Djinn; Mongols; Rakhshasas; Sinbad; Sorcerors; Islands; Gnolls; Pirate Kings; Junks; Fishmen; Dagon; Garuda; Lizardmen; Dinosaurs; Wandering Judges; Factions****    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/thundarr-the-barbarian-image-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/thundarr-the-barbarian-image-1.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Thundarr-the-Barbarian-image-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Much Like This&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for something completely different, a mash up of Gonzo D&amp;amp;D flavored Cartoons, but with taking themselves entirely seriously, and without the G/PG gloves on: Thundarr the Barbarian; He-Man and the Masters of the Universe; Thundercats; Pirates of Dark Water****    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vancian-supplement-cover-copy.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vancian-supplement-cover-copy.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Vancian Supplement cover copy&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Guy Makes Awesome Supplements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You Pitch That Campaign:&lt;/strong&gt; I dream about producing a small, attractive supplement with quality art and layout that strikes &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the right balance between interesting ideas to steal for your game and not being an overly wordy poor attempt at pseudo-fiction.  I envision the meat of it being tools to make homebrewing easier and better, and then some ingredients to include in your brew if you want (specific locations, cultures, et cetera).  Kinda like Vornheim, but for whole setting creation. I’m sure I’m the umpteenth person to have and express this wish, and someone has probably already made it and made it good.  But yeah, that would be the ultimate “pitch” to me.****    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/warhammer-40k_00258982.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/warhammer-40k_00258982.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;warhammer-40k_00258982&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres that Lure You:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s just something about that &lt;em&gt;Grim Darkness of the Far Future Where There is Only War&lt;/em&gt; that feels like it ought to make a hell of an RPG with the right treatment. But the published 40k games leave me cold.  Actually “leave me cold” is not fair.  It’s more like &amp;ldquo;make me want to smash the book into my face and wonder why, oh God why was this written this way?!&amp;rdquo; That being said, I’d like to run something like Dark Heresy with a different ruleset (my last thinking was a hack of Apocalypse World, but when I came to that decision, I thought everything should be a hack of Apocalypse World.  If I start considering it more seriously, I will probably be more amenable to other ways of doing things).  My histrionics aside, there are some really cool rules in the Fantasy Flight 40k games (well, in Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader, the two I have) – things like corruption as well as insanity, the rogue trader profit/purchasing system is a really cool way to easily simulate a large business empire in a way that drives play, that sort of thing.    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sultan01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sultan01.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;sultan01&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, and maybe a Sultan from Geek Chic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Interesting Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; The sad thing is that the “interesting tools” I most yearn for right now are the oldies but goodies – I would love to be able to play a game at a table, with physical paper maps, hand written props, et cetera.  Sometimes I fantasize about using miniatures and making some cool dungeon terrain and the like, but mostly I just don’t want the artificial constraints imposed by playing online.  I feel like a lot of the old school stuff I want to make a focus (player mapping, creative combat without relying on fancy rules, et cetera) loses usefulness in a Google+ Hangout.  Don’t get me wrong, the ability to play a weekly game with good friends scattered across the country far outweighs all the downsides, but at the end of the day, it’s still an acceptable substitute, not the real thing.****    ** &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vargwip5.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vargwip5.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;VargWIP5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaigns Avoiding Certain Problems:&lt;/strong&gt; This may be cheating and falling back on setting of particular interest, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/burningwheel/torchbearer&#34;&gt;Torchbearer&lt;/a&gt;looks like it handles the resource management issues of D&amp;amp;D not by abstracting them away, but by making them the focus of the game.  I sometimes feel like the nasty, brutish, and short phase of low-level old school D&amp;amp;D is the part I like the most, and it sure sounds like Torchbearer delivers on that, but I haven’t gotten a full copy of the rules yet, and I certainly haven’t played, so who knows?  It might go too far into &amp;ldquo;focused design&amp;rdquo; to make for good sustained play, and it might be too similar to D&amp;amp;D for &amp;ldquo;taking a break&amp;rdquo; from an ongoing D&amp;amp;D campaign, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.  If nothing else, hopefully there will be some tools to rip off for future homebrewing.****&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fellhold Session 31 Recap (and rules for clerics of Hrokr)</title>

        <guid>http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-22-fellhold-session-31-recap-and-rules-for/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-22-fellhold-session-31-recap-and-rules-for/ -&lt;p&gt;This will be a fairly bare bones recap, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been busier than anticipated this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yllgrad managed to escape the temple, and he even did so without murdering the initiates that he held hostage.  Of course, shortly after leaving, they told the high priest what had happened, and the priesthood of Gurgu decided to pursue the crazed dwarf.  When the characters who had undergone the initiation into the belief of Gurgu reached the shrine again, they found the priests and initiates looking agitated.  They disavowed knowing the dwarf well, claiming he had only just joined them on the voyage, and they agreed to help search him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they reached the town, Varian slipped away to try to warn Yllgrad, but Yllgrad&amp;rsquo;s player had concocted a devious plan after his first reaction, which was to suit up in his armor and get ready for a fight.  Instead, he went out openly to the crowd and claimed that he had been overtaken by a madness, the same madness which had brought him to seek out the healing power of Gurgu.  The priests believed him, and agreed to perform a ritual to cleanse him of his madness, assuming he agreed to profess his faith in Gurgu and to be confined until the ritual was complete (for his own safety and that of everyone else, of course).  While they wait out the night, Dag (Bryni&amp;rsquo;s henchman and former bandit sergeant) and Kieghl (fighter belonging to a new addition to the play group) stumble down some stairs under the semi-plausible excuse of looking for towels after bathing.  When they start finding fancy statues and floors, they head back before running into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they lock him in the very same robe closet from which he stole an oversized robe earlier in the day, and say that they will hold him until dawn to perform the ritual, as that is a time especially holy to Gurgu.  The rest of the party, having admitted to knowing him somewhat, are allowed to stay at the temple and to participate in the ritual to cleanse him.  Yllgrad is admitted into the faith by the same ritual undergone by the other characters previously.  After being initiated into the faith, the whole group (and a number of priests/initiates) were led to the lowest level of the temple in the volcano for the summoning of the avatar of Gurgu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dd_preview.jpg&#34;&gt;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/dd_preview.jpg&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;em&gt;Gurgu looked something like this, but made of lava&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone&amp;rsquo;s head bowed, Bjergmund retrieves the Heart of the Mountain from a secret room, and it really is a giant ruby, as big as two fists held together.  He tosses it into the lava and the imposing but passive figure of Gurgu rises from the magma.  Seeing the form, and hearing the priest talking about &amp;ldquo;cleansing this&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;power that&amp;rdquo;, Yllgrad decides to flee. The priests, initiates, and other PCs all go to tackle him so that the ritual can go forward.  Kieghl succeeds (with a critical) and Yllgrad is handily wrestled down to the ground and returned to the ritual.  Bjergmund beseeches Gurgu to outstretch his hand, take away the madness, and return to the fiery heart of the world to burn it away, and sure enough, Gurgu stretches out one hand (burning Bjergmund and Yllgrad from his proximity), and then returns into the magma.  After sinking back into the lava, the Heart of the Mountain pops back out onto the platform.  Yllgrad is declared healed, and everyone is asked to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party agrees and heads back to town, though now they&amp;rsquo;re wondering why Gurgu didn&amp;rsquo;t notice the lack of any real madness, and why he appeared so passive in the face of someone who was faking belief in him.  Back in the inn, they decided to investigate more and try to find their way to the temple&amp;rsquo;s library to learn more about Gurgu and the volcano, and that&amp;rsquo;s where we left them.    &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For rules, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to cop out and just post the new spell lists I came up with for Clerics of Hrokr (trickster god of magic and hospitality and such like).  The main thing is that even though I left cure light wounds (mostly cos we had already used that a lot), clerics of Hrokr aren&amp;rsquo; t so good at healing later on.  But they get some magic user spells, and they get to learn runes by prayer (instead of study).  So hopefully this will help to differentiate the from Clerics of Dwyn (our other cleric in the party is a cleric of Dwyn) who have some druid type spells.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post that another time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleric of Hrokr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.     Charm Monster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.     Confusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.     Hallucinatory Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.     Massmorph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.     Wizard Eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever a Cleric of Hrokr gains a new spell “slot”, he may opt to pray to Hrokr to teach him a new rune.  Once a rune is learned in this fashion, it permanently takes up one spell slot of any level (make a note on your character sheet what level slot the rune replaced). For example, a cleric of Hrokr advances to 4th level, and opts to learn a rune.  He decides to replace one of his two 1st level slots with a rune.  He survives many adventures and reaches 9th level. At this point, he will have 2 level one spells available, because one of the 3 listed is still taken up by a rune. If a cleric learns a rune through study or a tutor, it does not take up a spell slot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a cleric of Hrokr gains a rune through prayer, he will receive one randomly determined rune.  Roll on the following table.  If the character already possesses the rune rolled, he gains special insight into his god’s secrets, and may instead choose freely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.     Victory Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.     Opening Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.     Ale Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.     Wave Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.     Heal Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.     Curse Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.     Ward Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.     Fear Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.     Berserk Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.  Fire Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.  Dead Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.  Disease Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13.  Strength Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14.  Water Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.  Earth Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16.  Air Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17.  Iron Can’t Bite Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18.  Fortune Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19.  Shield Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.  Sealing Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-16-runic-magic-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;*Nota Bene: Pretty much this entire post is rules, but I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained the convention of bold italic type so that it will stand out if you&amp;rsquo;re scrolling up or down the page only looking for the useful stuff. *    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/runes1-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/runes1-1.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Runes1 (1)&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to come add magic runes to the Fellhold campaign for a while now, to get that delicious Viking flavor.  I contemplated a cool combinatory system with very modular runes, kinda inspired by sygalldry in Patrick Rothfuss&amp;rsquo;s Kingkiller Chronicle books, but I decided that a) that would be a whole lot of work, and b) it would clash with the overall Vancian magical flavor of D&amp;amp;D the campaign has mostly relied on.  That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of different rule systems for Magic, and I fully plan on creating such a system for a campaign where it would fit better.  I also have an idea on doing something based off the way semitic languages have vowel roots and apply consonants in forms with loose semantic meanings to get words, but that&amp;rsquo;s way outside the scope of this here post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I checked out the AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition Viking Campaign sourcebook, the Realms of Sorcery supplement for WFRP 2nd Edition, and wikipedia articles on runes mentioned in the Poetic Edda and sagas, and on Icelandic &amp;lsquo;Staves&amp;rsquo;.  Though I initially had high hopes for the WFRP runes, they were almost all blandly combat stat buffs.  Which is useful, of course, but not as flavorful as what I wanted.  WFRP&amp;rsquo;s heavily skill and talent based approach was also not the right answer for mechanical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up drawing a lot more from the historical Viking Campaign sourcebook than I expected to on my first read through.  There were actually some kind of cool concepts about shaping the rune each and every time, because the nature of the thing inscribed and the specific circumstance and so forth all combined to give the rune a unique physical expression every time, and it had to be imbued with power.  So I took a little bit of that for my own so that just knowing how to scratch the symbol doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you crazy powers (even if I suspect that the historical basis for &amp;ldquo;magic runes&amp;rdquo; is at least a little tied up in illiterate people being impressed by literacy and what you could do with it - this is D&amp;amp;D, damnit, not a historical exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few basic concepts I thought would make runes interestingly flexible and open ended (the sort of magic I find coolest for games).  First, I struck on the notion that the permanence of the runes effect is related to the permanence of how it is inscribed.  Rather than flat out stating &amp;ldquo;runes must be carved into something&amp;rdquo;, I wanted there to be the option to hastily scrawl something with your own blood on an improvised surface, but it won&amp;rsquo;t last very long and it won&amp;rsquo;t be very powerful compared to a purpose made rune imbued with great power and cast into an armband as it is made.  Next, the power of the rune is effected by the quality and permanence of the item.  Both of these are for thematic as well as gameplay reasons.  Thematically, it makes magical thinking sense if more purposefully and permanently doing something to a thing of greater value gets you greater effects.  Gameplay wise, I don&amp;rsquo;t want players just chalking exploding runes onto every which surface they find willy nilly.  Which ties into another thing I knew I wanted to do with runes: make them &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fire and forget.  You know a rune, or you don&amp;rsquo;t.  So the resource management aspect has to come in somewhere else than &amp;ldquo;times a day you can use them&amp;rdquo;.  You have to manage physical components, time to shape, et cetera.  Also, runes are heavily front loaded resource-wise.  You have to either spend a lot of time and money studying one, or else you have to give up a spell slot *permanently.  *The final thing I knew about runes going in was that I wanted them to be flexible and open ended and able to be combined by clever players (even if I ditched the idea of modular &amp;lsquo;programming&amp;rsquo; style runes for build your own magic items).    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/27075.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/27075.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;27075&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is where I ran into some troubles.  See, the uber-specific rules given in the 2E viking campaign book left me cold, and they were largely written as a low-magic replacement for traditional D&amp;amp;D Vancian magic users for the purposes of genre emulation, rather than as a supplement to that system that provided different tactical, strategic, and logistical choices.  I was also running up against a time constraint, because my clerics were about to level up, and I wanted to fundamentally tweak their options based on their patron before they got too high in level and locked into the pseudo-Christian crusader baked into the cleric class as written.  So I ended up copping out a little bit.  I just gave the runes brief, qualitative descriptions, and figure I&amp;rsquo;ll adjudicate rules for individual uses on the fly.  &lt;em&gt;Hopefully&lt;/em&gt; this vagueness will lead to creative and cunning uses devised by players and a lack of restriction on my part, but I worry that they will be so vague as to lose out in comparison to known goods like healing spells and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I ended up stumbling into with runes as I was writing the rules for learning them was the decision that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can learn them.  I just a) let priests of Hrokr get them by prayer (but then its random), and b) made it so that Magic Users learn them faster by study than do others (studying arcane things to unlock their use is sort of their entire job).  But if Clerics want a specific rune, or if fighting men want to stray into more mythic archetypal territory, they have the option if they throw down a lot of time and (presumably) money.    ## &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runic Magic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runes can be granted to clerics of Hrokr through prayer, or they may be learned through intense study of from a talented teacher.  A rune is not merely a symbol with magical properties.  Rather, it is a physical distillation of the true nature of a thing in relation to the world.  So, a berserk rune will vary depending upon what surface and for what warrior it is crafted, and understanding the forces necessary to apply this to any object is a matter of some insight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Runes impart abilities to the objects on which they are inscribed or to their bearers.  Usually, merely writing or painting a rune is insufficient to unite the energies of the rune with the item upon which it is placed, but some runes can grant a limited or weak effect when so temporarily marked.  There is a direct relationship between the permanence and craft of the object and the method of inscription to the power of the rune.  Thus, a sword crafted by a master smith, with the runes worked into the blade as it is forged and quenched will be a far more potent item with more permanent powers than a dagger with a rune hastily scratched into its hilt. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes the release of the energies of a rune will damage or destroy the item upon which it is placed, and this is more likely the more hastily crafted the rune is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Runes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cleric of Hrokr can learn a rune whenever he gains a new spell slot.  If he chooses to do so, he automatically learns a randomly determined rune and it permanently replaces one of his spell slots.  He may choose which spell slot, and it need not be the newly acquired slot.  Once chosen, it may not be moved to a different spell slot.  To randomly determine what rune is learned, roll 1d20 and consult the list below.  If the result is a rune already known to the cleric, he may instead choose freely, as he has been granted particular insight by Hrokr.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Any character may attempt to learn a rune through study if he has access to obscure runic lore, or to a tutor (these will probably take some finding!).  These sources will have information on only a few, specific runes, and access to them will probably not be cheap.  If the referee has not established which runes the source can teach, and he can’t decide, he may randomly roll 1d4 runes from the list below. Learning a rune from pure study (no tutor) takes 20 – the character’s level in weeks if he is a magic user, and 20 – half the character’s level (rounded down) if he is a fighting man or cleric. A tutor will reduce this time by 5 weeks.  The minimum time to learn a rune is 1 week.  However much time it takes, it is a period of intense study, and the character is considered to do nothing else of consequence during this time.  If there are any interruptions, he must start over and take the full amount of time.  At the end of the period, the character attempts to roll under his intelligence.  If he fails, he may retest in another week.  Continue retesting once a week until the character gives up or succeeds.  ***    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of Runes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victory Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 2.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 3.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ale Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 4.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wave Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 5.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heal Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 6.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 7.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ward Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 8.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 9.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berserk Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 10. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 11. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 12. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 13. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 14. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 15. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 16. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 17. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Can’t Bite Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 18. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 19. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shield Rune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 20. ***Sealing Rune ***&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;descriptions&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These descriptions are purposefully left vague in order to facilitate their creative application.  Referees should make rulings on their use based on the desired level of fantasticness and power they want runes to bring to their games.  Just remember the guidelines: the more permanent the inscription, the more powerful the effect, the higher quality and more permanent the material, the stronger the effect, the more temporary, the more likely the rune will damage or destroy the object inscribed, and the rune must be crafted by the casters own hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-16-how-to-make-sweet-d100-tables-for-fun/ -&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or: The &lt;strong&gt;FINGER&lt;/strong&gt; system of faux-creativity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve got a terrible confession to make.  As a self-described GM/Referee and creative person, I’m not actually that good at coming up with wacky creative ideas out of thin air.  I read stuff by &lt;a href=&#34;http://gorgonmilk.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Gorgonmilk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Zak S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jrients.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Jeff Rients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://osr.robertsongames.com/&#34;&gt;so forth&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m always astounded by the raw awesome they seem to be able to pull out of the ether, and I greedily appropriate it for my own game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what I am good at, if I may say so myself, is in selectively recombining things to get something new(ish) with a coherent feel.  So, a pastiche artist, if you will.  This used to drive me into fits of self-questioning angst, or launch me into pretentious justification of the inherent creativity of fitting together other’s works, but now I just accept it and try to have fun with it.  And keep my ideas for Thing A + Thing B but in Place C fantasy/sci-fi novels/comics/movies to myself (or realize the setting would be better for games anyway).    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/darth_vader_riding_charizard__colored__by_smithaboy-d59f14o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/darth_vader_riding_charizard__colored__by_smithaboy-d59f14o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;darth_vader_riding_charizard__colored__by_smithaboy-d59f14o&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You know, this sort of thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, this tendency has been combined with my immersion into the Old School Renaissance/DIY D&amp;amp;D/whatever you want to call it.  I’ve always liked to tinker and house rule and design games, but &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; the habit of reading gaming material with an eye to ruthlessly tear out, appropriate, and modify any rules that I find useful is one that I’ve developed to a higher degree the last few months than ever before.  I initially got a bunch of retroclones and versions of D&amp;amp;D with the idea of soberly comparing, weighing strengths and weaknesses, and then selecting the one I liked best.  But now I look at all of them with the dispassionate eye of a black market organ harvester.  One of these days, DCC RPG is going to wake up in a bathtub full of ice, missing its zero level “funnel” character creation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, last week, just as I was going to stat up some simple hydra teeth that turn into skeleton warriors, or a goat-legged Cyclops or something, I had a revelation.  I was reading the synopsis of “7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Voyage of Sinbad” and I realized how insanely D&amp;amp;D it was.  I checked other Harryhausen synopses and found that while the Sinbad movies were far and away the most D&amp;amp;D, everything had some stuff that was usable.  And I realized that I had started applying the pitiless scalpel of game material selection to creative stuff, fluff if you will, as well as to mechanics.  And the d100 table of random Harryhausenisms was born (by far my highest traffic post so far, so thanks folks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about it, and I realized that the actual procedure I used is replicable, and is in fact quite simple.  And that if you’re willing to be a little pastichey, you can cover a lot of setting ground with it.  This one’s going to be a little long, but you can probably get most of what’s here with the following list and the two examples at the end. Without further ado:    ## &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff’s Guide to Making a Dwhatever Map Stocking Chart for Fun and Profit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Okay, more likely just fun, but let me know if you figure out the profit part)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    1.  ***1.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find an inspiring piece of media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 2.  ***2.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify the cool stuff in it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 3.  ***3.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noun that stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 4.  ***4.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genericize those nouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 5.  ***5.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand their uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 6.  ***6.    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready your chart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(I figured out I could get a cute acronym about halfway through).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step One – Find an Inspiring Piece of Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select a piece of media that gets your motor going or that fits with the milieu you’re shooting for.  Alternatively, if you’re looking to spice things up, purposely select something &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of your usual genre/world tropes, but that is still inspiring to you.  That’s the main thing.  You think it’s cool, and it’s something creative.  This is easiest to do with things that tell stories: books, movies, comics.  But you can do it with pictures or music or whatever as well.  I’ve started using heavy metal song lyrics all the time.  Examples to follow the explanation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Two – Identify Cool Stuff in It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Go through this inspiring piece of media, and look for the cool stuff.  The easiest way to do this is to go to Wikipedia and read the plot synopsis (that’s what I did for the Harryhausen table), as this will by definition hit the highlights and moments of drama.  You could use back of book blurbs, internet reviews, whatever.  Or if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like something, you can read through the actual source material and take notes or highlight or whatever.  Find the things that most scream “Gameable” and  “Awesome” to you. ***    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Three – Noun that Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Once you’ve identified elements from your source material that are cool, you want to Noun them.  This is the opposite of Verbing things.  You see, verbs are the province of Plot.  Plot is not what we want here, because we’re all good sandboxy/player agency oriented referees, right?  Notice that’s big “P” Plot.  Yes, you can have a lovely picaresque plot emerge from the processes of play, and it probably will.  That’s in the future.  Because for our purposes, verbs are what &lt;em&gt;player characters&lt;/em&gt; do.  Sometimes NPCs get to do verbs in &lt;em&gt;reaction&lt;/em&gt; to player characters or because of some internal game world logic, but that’s not what our stocking table is for.  If you have a bunch of verbs on your list, then you either have to run an entire clockwork world in the background, for which there are better tools, or else have the artificialness that the zany, interesting action the players just walked up on just so happens to be going on right as the players find it, no matter when or under what circumstances they roll up. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why you don’t want to put the action in there, you want a person, a place, or a thing.  Maybe a scene or tableau if you want to push it.  The key here is that you present an element of the world, just like any other, that the players can act on and react to.  Making the scene into a noun makes it make more sense as a static feature, or even if it is a “this happens as you come upon it” (sometimes fun to include, I’ll admit) it doesn’t presume the player characters’ involvement.  It’s just there for them to interact with. None of this is to say that these nouns shouldn’t be ready to spring into appropriate action once the player characters poke it, just try to avoid things that are the other way around (that’s what random encounters are for).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Four – Genericize those Nouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Now, here’s the tricky part, but the part that will help you find way more ideas: you want to take the cool nouned elements from your inspiring piece of media, and then you want to file off the serial numbers.  Got a reference to Mentok the Mindtaker? Turn that into “an evil mentalist”.  There’s a balance to be struck here: too generic and stuff isn’t cool or gameable. Too specific and your table becomes less useful to others, and also less useful to you.  If you want to use a cool specific guy or monster, don’t put it in a stocking table! Put it where you want it in your world, or else on a random encounter table.  The only thing gained by putting a specific person or thing in a stocking table is you don’t know where he or she or it will end up, and you can just do that by rolling once for the thing. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Likewise, don’t get hung up on trappings or genre stuff too much.  For the Harryhausen table I made, even though most of the table came from the overtly fantasy Sinbad movies and Clash of the Titans, something like a quarter to a third of the entries (don’t quote me on that) are from movies set in modern America with fantastic elements (even aliens).  So, when you spot an evil wizard, consider thinking of him as just “an evil powerful guy” or “an evil guy with secret knowledge”.  Or if you find a story about hackers jacking some stuff in cyberspace (like the kids do), you can genericize it into “A highly skilled group of rogues pulls off an impressive heist.”  The key is not to lose the “character” of the person or thing you identify and make it so generic as to be boring, but to make it broadly useful and able to fit into whatever sort of world (unless the whole point is to introduce some gonzo weirdness or subvert genre tropes, in which case, have at it).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A variation of this if you’re only concerned with your own campaign world is to ‘reskin’ rather than genericize.  That’s basically what I did with the Harryhausen results from the 20&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; century America movies (and even the caveman movie) – I recast it in D&amp;amp;D terms (science becomes magic, aliens become generic invaders, et cetera).  Again, try to keep what was cool or striking about the thing, the underlying reason it will be a potential source of danger or excitement, but then make it so you can recombine it with any other damn thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5 – Expand their Uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Okay, I started stretching the names a little bit at this part so that I could make the acronym FINGER.  What I mean by “expand their uses” could also be described as analysis (from the Greek for “to chop up”, more or less).  So, you’ve got a cool thing, you’ve made sure it’s a noun, and you’ve made it so you can drop it into multiple places and situations in your world. You want to make sure that one entry on your chart isn’t being too greedy.  One of the chief values of charts is that like our old favorite sexual reproduction, you can recombine elements in novel and unexpected ways, and the end result might be a better fit for your environment than something you would have expected of planned.  The way to maximize the recombinatory potential of your chart is to try to make sure each entry is just “one thing”.  The way you get each entry to be “one thing” is to chop up an element you stole from your source.  So, if you find an awesome fight scene where a guy fights a wizard’s guard dragon by jerry rigging a ballista, and then the dragon falls on the wizard and kills him, you can turn that into 1) A wizard with a guard dragon, 2) A jerry rigged siege weapon, 3) A beast that kills its own master (that last one is a little verby, but hey). ***    ### &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6 – Ready your Chart!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***This one is easy and was mostly in order to get the full acronym.  Just take your entries and arrange them into a chart.  Usually you’ll do this as you go, and the fact that, say, you only have 89 will spur you to find those last 11 so you can make a d100.  And you’re done! ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you’re done with this chart.  But as mentioned before, unless your only goal is to make something for other people, or a crutch to fall back on in some indeterminate future, the process of making this chart could just as easily have been used to think up a setting.  Zak S. talks about this in his thoughts on types of random generators.  What we have above is kind of an incomplete results generator to spur creativity, but by itself that’s not very useful to you, since you made the chart yourself.  So, unless going through and making the table was a useful exercise for you creatively, or you just want to have on hand stuff that will surprise even you when the players go somewhere new, you need a little more to make your new chart super awesome.  For that recombinatory goodness, you could make a second chart, and make any locations of interest be Chart 1 + Chart 2 (a mutational generator, to use the terminology from the above link).  Or you could just make a d1000 chart or some other madness, so that you end up with things you stole from the Poetic Edda rubbing shoulders with things you stole from a Dethklok album which are a few days voyage from things you yoinked from Hellboy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections are another good one: randomly determine two of the things you’ve placed on the map, and then make a connection.  You can either use a connection suggested by the nature of each entry, or you could randomize it.  Do enough of this, and there’s a lot of latent connections throughout your map that players can stumble across, and if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to do some background verbs, you know what they’ll be.  I think coming up with a good system to find relations between placed sites of interest is going to be my next big rules project after this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bonus points, you can put your new chart in Abulafia and combine it with the work of others and save yourself time all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, let’s do some examples! I probably should have just made the whole thing examples, but I’m a very verbal, explainy person, so there you go.    #### Example #1 – Wikipedia Plot Synopsis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hillsofthedead11.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/hillsofthedead11.jpg?w=229&#34; alt=&#34;HillsOfTheDead11&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could just recap what I did with the Harryhausen movies, but that would be cheating, and I want to test out my method as explained.  So instead, let’s pick something else inspirational for D&amp;amp;D type stuff and go with everyone’s favorite hardass puritan, Solomon Kane! Let’s go with “Hills of the Dead” by Robert E. Howard.  Wikipedia has the following blurb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First published in Weird Tales, August 1930.  In Africa again, Kane’s old friend N’Longa (the witch doctor from “Red Shadows”) gives the Puritan a magic wooden staff, the Staff of Solomon, which will protect him in his travels.  Kane enters the jungle and finds a city of vampires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ind an Inspiring Piece of Media&lt;/em&gt;: Was pretty easily accomplished by finding an awesome story by Robert E. Howard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;dentify the Cool Stuff&lt;/em&gt;: is also not too hard, because REH stories are dripping with D&amp;amp;Dable material, even when summarized in two sentences: Solomon Kane, The Hills of the Dead, Africa, N’Longa the witch doctor, the Staff of Solomon, a jungle, and a city of vampires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;oun that Stuff:&lt;/em&gt; I kind of went ahead and identified the nouns in the process above, but if we had a more detailed synopsis and I wanted to pull an element out of a cool fight scene with the vampires in their city, this is where I would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;enericize those Nouns:&lt;/em&gt; To genericize this stuff, we could turn Africa into “a mysterious continent” or “an unfamiliar land” or whatever.  The idea is to get at what made Africa an exciting place to set a story to a 1930’s Texan writing about a 17&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; century puritan and pull it out for D&amp;amp;D (exotic, unexplored, dangerous creatures, magic, unfamiliar cultures, “savagery”, et cetera).  The Hills of the Dead is a nicely evocative name that you can lift and then decide what it means.  It could be a place full of barrows, the burial grounds of ancient dynasties, a hell on earth ruled by the undead, whatever.  Sometimes you get generic by taking a specific cool name and then making its use generic, rather than stripping the name off of a specific cool thing.  Make N’Longa just “A witch doctor”, make the Staff of Solomon “A Powerful Magical staff” or even just “An ancient artifact”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;xpand their Uses:&lt;/em&gt; Expanding/analyzing isn’t super necessary for most of these elements, but here’s a couple of examples: take N’Longa giving Kane the staff and change that into “A witch doctor with a useful magical item” and into “A powerful artifact from ancient times”.  Or take the city of vampires in the jungle and break it out into “A City of vampires” and “An ancient city in the jungle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;eady your Chart!&lt;/em&gt; :Take that cool stuff and slap it into a table! Here’s a lame tiny table smaller than is really worthwhile to make:    1.  A wandering religious warrior 2.  An exotic, unexplored land 3.  An old friend from a foreign land 4.  A witch doctor with a useful item 5.  A powerful artifact from ancient times 6.  An ancient city in the jungle 7.  A city of vampires 8.  The Hills of the Dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-2--cover-to-hellboy-conqueror-worm&#34;&gt;Example #2 – Cover to Hellboy: Conqueror Worm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than go the easy route and use a plot synopsis of this comic, let’s just look at the artwork for inspiration (okay, I’m gonna probably rely on some of my Hellboy knowledge here to provide context, but that’s only because Hellboy is so awesome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ind an Inspiring Piece of Media&lt;/em&gt;: This picture:    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/250px-hellboy_conqueror_worm.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/250px-hellboy_conqueror_worm.jpg?w=194&#34; alt=&#34;250px-Hellboy_Conqueror_Worm&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;dentify the Cool Stuff&lt;/em&gt;: Hellboy, gasmask guy, Lobster Johnson, giant worm, floating flame, golem, head in a jar, a saint, some skulls, the name “Conqueror Worm”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;oun that Stuff&lt;/em&gt;: A lot easier with a ‘posed’ picture, so not much to do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;enericize those Nouns&lt;/em&gt;: Hellboy becomes a half demon, or an investigator, or a hero fighting monsters (or in the next step, all of these).  Gasmask guy becomes the footsoldier of an evil regime.  The golem can stay a golem, the head in a jar can become a mad scientist, or an evil wizard, or a head in a jar, or a demi-lich, the conqueror worm can be a mundane giant worm, or a summoning gone wrong, or the avatar of an inhuman god, Lobster Johnson can be a vigilante, or a skilled warrior, or a man seeking revenge, the saint can be any old saint, or a painting of a saint, or the shrine to a saint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;xpand their Uses&lt;/em&gt;: As mentioned above, Hellboy alone can give us three different people, and that’s without him even having any action to draw off of in this picture.  If we dig a little we can also say: the son of a witch, the possessor of a magical weapon, an artifact that is the key to the end of the world.  Our gasmask guy can be an evil footsoldier, undead menace, a faceless servant of darkness, a bug eyed, long snouted creature, whatever.  Sometimes you don’t necessarily want to completely parse out every aspect, or you’ll lose some of what makes that element cool to drop in.  You might prefer to have “a half demon who struggles to be good” rather than “a half demon” and “a warrior who struggles to do the right thing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;eady your Chart!&lt;/em&gt; :So, let’s do another d8 weak sauce table:    1.  A half demon son of a witch 2.  The incarnation of an alien god 3.  The head of an evil wizard kept alive in a jar of fluid 4.  Faceless shock troops of an evil regime 5.  A vigilante that leaves his mark on his victims 6.  The defiled shrine of a saint 7.  A golem with a sense of self 8.  An enormous, disgusting wormbeast&lt;/p&gt;

Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night once again saw the absence of a couple of players due to finals-induced napping, but also saw the reappearance of the long absent player of Blum (the dead wizard) and Ash (the new wizard who has basically been played as a henchman up to this point). Varian&amp;rsquo;s player returned, and despite some good natured complaints that the rules were “unfairly targeting” him, sure enough gave the carousing rules a go and peer pressured Yllgrad’s player into joining him.  Unfortunately for me, both passed their poison saves easily and another one of the players agreed to cover Yllgrad’s excessive tab, so I was robbed of all opportunities for shenanigans springing from Mr. Rients’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://jrients.blogspot.com/2011/09/carousing-in-wessex.html&#34;&gt;excellent carousing table&lt;/a&gt;.  But it remains, waiting for its next opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after recovering from hangovers, the party set out to engage the services of one of the captains they found out about &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/fellhold-session-29-recap/&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.  They decided to go with Guth and Spir, the gruff ex-watchmen and his lanky partner, on the thinking that a couple of treasure hunters might prove hardier than some of the other captains if the natives turn restless.  After some negotiation on fees and some debates about the nature of insurance for faux-medieval shipping, they saved some money by pressganging their huge following of hirelings into rowers (to be fair, they were willing to take some turns at the oars themselves).    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cleveland_volcano_june_2012_3_0.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cleveland_volcano_june_2012_3_0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cleveland_volcano_june_2012_3_0&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only even more Volcano-y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making the necessary arrangements, they set out to the island of Fyrberg.  After some discussion, they decided it would be best to soft pedal things to begin with and get the lay of the land.  So after an arbitrary percentage roll to determine if there was foul weather (there wasn’t), around dusk they came up to the docks of Bjergby, the sleepy little fishing town on the island, and arranged lodging for their troupe.  They told the innkeeper there that they had come to check out the hot springs, and he told them to head on up to the shrine in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the shrine, they were greated by the high priest of Gurgu, Bjergmund.  He’s a friendly, enthusiastic-in-a-low-key-kind-of-way guy, and he informs them that all are welcome to enjoy the hot springs for a small donation (1 gold per person for as long as you like), but that all are invited to learn the ways of Gurgu.  Yllgrad declined to get in on this nonsense, not trusting the baths, so he hung back out of sight and out of mind.  Earn, the cleric of Dwyn and his followers decided to simply partake of the baths, while Caleb decided to feign interest in the cult of Gurgu.  He convinced Varian and Ash to come along as well.  I reminded him that as a cleric, he is a character who believes in his god &lt;em&gt;so hard&lt;/em&gt; that he gets magic powers, but also that his god is a god of deceit and trickery, so he should factor those things into his decision.  He said he felt good about the fake initiation into a new religion and a delighted Bjergmund led them deeper into the volcano (did I mention the shrine is inside the volcano?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Earn and his three hirelings take a long, relaxing and rejuvenating bath.  They don’t know it, but had they been injured, they’d have healed at an increased rate, and if something comes up where being relaxed enmineraled seems like it would be a factor, I’ll come up with some other unspecified benefit.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_1156-m.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_1156-m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_1156-M&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earn&amp;rsquo;s the only PC who enjoyed a nice, pleasant non-baptismal bath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also meanwhile, after the other two groups are led their separate ways, Yllgrad sneaks in and starts to listen at doors and snoop about.  I love how the default assumption in D&amp;amp;D that things are perilous informs players&amp;rsquo; actions.  More on that later. At any rate, he finds a human sized robe of the initiates of Gurgu and puts it on, then hitches it up and continues on his snooping way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party following Bjergmund is led past a central open shaft in the volcano (totally unrealistic but also totally cooler than either a) spurts of magma coming out of a relatively short mountain or b) a tall, normal seeming mountain that suddenly explodes and kills everyone) and into a chapel.  He invites them to kneel and says a brief prayer to Gurgu, welcoming these new followers.  He directs them to a font of steaming hot mineral water and has them drink.  Then he leads them to a series of linked baths called the “cleansing path”.  The players are mostly passive through all this, though Caleb keeps spontaneously chiming in with expressions of devotion and converted zeal.  Each stop on the path is a little allegorical homily followed by a dunk in hot mineral water, at the end of which they are invited to pray as the spirit of Gurgu moves them.  Once again, Caleb whips out the new convert gusto and Bjergmund is impressed, almost like this guy knows how to lead a prayer or something.  He then leads them around a path, showing them some store rooms and a secret entrance known to the faithful, and then back to a statue where followers leave small candles and offerings in times of trouble, and then he invites them to dine with some of the other initiates and leaves them to attend to some other matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earn’s bath continued to be lovely through all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yllgrad, on the other hand, begins to follow a path that spirals around down around the central shaft, lit by the glow of hot liquid magma hundreds of feet below.  He pokes his head in a few rooms, finds some storage areas, a kitchen (which he avoids, because he hears the sounds of cooking inside), and a darkened classroom with wax tablets covered in the runic alphabet, and a storage room with child sized robes.  He has a moment of awful revelation that they’ve never seen any children here until I tell him that, yes, there were children in the village, just none here in the temple he’s sneaking around.   So he decides to change into a child sized robe and hides the adult sized robe in the storage room before going back out to the central shaft and continuing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s at this point that he gets hit by a jet of scalding hot steam.  I’ll admit to a little trepidation in their employment, for reasons that will become clear in a moment.  See, I wanted to have a hazard that could be spotted and avoided like a trap, but which was in fact just a natural hazard.  Unfortunately, basing their “activation” on a random chance when anyone passes them (1 in 6) makes them seem like they’re set off with intent.  Even if you allow his dwarven stone sense to notice there’s something weird (passed, described water in otherwise dry area, crack in wall – he tested by rolling a rock and throwing another).  And a listen check to hear the building hissing sound (failed), then a breath weapon save to take half damage (failed).  So he got rather scalded, and I’m worried I fell a little into ‘bad trap’ design.  I realize now I should have described the noise of the building steam rather than testing to see if he noticed it, because that was the key step to his agency in negotiating the hazard.  By randomizing it, his only options were “use my player knowledge that we’ve engaged this feature with a lot of rules already and go back rather than press on to presumably interesting stuff” or “press on since I don’t have a good reason to take any further precautions”.  I failed to build enough clues in for him to ask about to learn enough to make an informed decision.  Well, live and learn, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Yllgrad lived and learned as well, even if he did take 12 damage from scalding steam.  So, when he heard footsteps beyond the next door he gave a listen to, he concocted a clever ruse.  He imitated a child and said “help, help!”  Well, these folks come running, and he’s waiting for them.  They’re unarmed, so unlike his initial plan to hit one in the face with an axe (or rather, all 3, because they’re all 1 hd fellows), he instead grabs one and leans him out over the lava shaft and demands to know what is going on here.  He figures they activated the steam since there was no obvious trigger mechanism but it burned the crap out of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They blubber a lot because they were minding their own business helping to sweep the local church when some dwarf in one of their robes grabbed one of them and threatened his life.  But he pulls the guy back and holds him hostage with his knife and demands to be led the way they came from.  He asks them what’s back there, and they tell him the greater mysteries, they don’t know, they’re just initiates.  He threatens to kill their friend and they say the same thing. Well, he makes them lead him through the doors into the greater mysteries, and every time they object even a little, it’s again with the knife to the throat.  So, he finds some rooms with mysterious gold circle patterns inlaid in the floor, and they don’t know what they are because they’ve never been in there before.  And that’s where we left off.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sm64volcano.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/sm64volcano.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;sm64volcano&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only imagine Mario holding a Goomba over the edge by the throat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was saying earlier, it’s fun how the combination of a) the default assumptions of D&amp;amp;D, and b) some rumors they picked up at dockside bars in Mickleheim, have the players convinced that the seemingly innocent cult of Gurgu is not what it seems.  And maybe it isn’t. Their going theory is that Gurgu is a demon and the cult has been duped into thinking he’s a benevolent god, and that they’re going to find something sinister sooner or later, which will give them the chance to kick some ass and take the Heart of the Mountain, the rumored giant ruby they came here to find.  We’ll see, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about running this location is that I kind of inadvertently ended up with a “Village of Hommlet” kind of scenario, where the interactions with and within the village will end up being important, and the NPC personalities will be big factors (for now at least).  I also gave some thought to Zak S.’s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/10/slacker-dm-adventure-checklist.html&#34;&gt;places sometimes being dungeons and sometimes not&lt;/a&gt;, depending on what’s going on there.  The shrine was not a dungeon to most of the group, but it was to Yllgrad.  Later on it might be a dungeon to everybody or to nobody.  I didn’t really set out intending such a scenario, but it’s turning out to be fun and an interesting departure from the default assumptions of Fellhold itself, the wilderness, or even Mickleheim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the players finish up with Fyrberg, I’m going to post a full write up of the location as an adventure and map, but I don’t want to give anything away just yet.  In the meantime, here’s a steam vent hazard for some quickie rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam Vent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A crack in the wall is covered in condensation, and the floor in front of it is damp compared to the surrounding area. Every so often, a jet of steam bursts from the crack, scalding anything in its path.  When a party passes, there is a 1 in 6 chance of the steam venting.  It is preceded by a telltale hissing noise, like water about to boil in a tea kettle.  Randomize which character in an affected group is in front of the vent when it goes off, and then apply a cone to ft long and 5 ft wide at its widest.  This cone does 4d8 scalding damage, save vs. breath weapon for half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, others have been able to address in greater detail and with more value the influence Ray Harryhausen and his films had on the development of D&amp;amp;D, both the original game and the thousands of referees and dungeon masters that have implemented it, so I will not reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I will speak as a relative newcomer.  You see, I grew up at an unfortunate time where Harryhausen’s stuff was old, but not yet classic (at least, not viewed as classic enough to have wide exposure despite its age).  So other than some background noise and glimpses, I didn’t really get into his stuff until well after computer generated graphics had seized Hollywood visual effects.  (And what a loss! “7&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;th&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Voyage of Sinbad” is pure D&amp;amp;D gold!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, though, I could appreciate the fundamental realness of the creatures.  Sure, their movements were slightly unnatural, and sure, it was sometimes clear that they had been inserted into the shot, but there was never the flat fakeness of CG to cope with.  Something that the guy in charge of the “bigatures” from the Lord of the Rings movies said in one of the behind the scenes specials really stuck with me.  He talked about how despite all the advances in CG, there’s just something about real light bouncing off of real objects and into a camera (even if it’s then digitized) that CG just can’t beat.  Maybe someday, but right now, even if your eyes can tell something is a model, they can also tell that it’s a real thing.  That’s one of my favorite things about the LOTR movies, that they used real models wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that’s why Harryhausen’s stuff holds up so well.  Even if the film itself looks dated, the stop-motion critters continue to look like tangible, and even if it’s clear that they were shaped by human hands, it is clear in the same way that an impressionist painting or a Duhrer sketch are clearly not photographs, but were filtered through an individual’s mind and creativity.  And I think that’s why the Harryhausen creations have more sticking power than even creative and well done CG – that analog artisticness is appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Mr. Harryhausen, I am sad to see you go.  But thank you for making your creativity tangible and sharing it with so many.  It’s an inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve taken some inspiration from Zak S.’s use of random Thor elements or random Tolkien elements, and come up with 100 cool adventure hooks/things of interest based off of Harryhausen’s movies.  This would make excellent fodder for a “Wavecrawl” type setting, but I’ve tried to keep most generic enough to be useful wherever, but specific enough to inspire referees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;***46. *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A king that orders children slain to thwart a prophecy
has angered a god&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;***47. *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A king arranging a suicidal quest for a rival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;***48. *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A contest to join a prestigious crew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;***49. *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A truly excellent ship, said to have been crafted in

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-08-fellhold-session-29-recap/ -&lt;p&gt;Last night’s session saw us with about half the usual group due to a confluence of work and finals for three of the players.  So, that left us with Caleb, Earn, and Yllgrad in the big city of Mickleheim.  Their players were pretty pumped about getting stuff sold and getting to the Volcano, but a) I wanted to flesh out Mickleheim some, b) I wanted to give some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=75&#34;&gt;Vornheim city kit rules&lt;/a&gt; and others that I’ve compiled a test drive, and c) I needed some more time to properly prep the volcano adventure, so we ended up zooming in on their errands in the city.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ss_art_gothmagog.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ss_art_gothmagog.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;ss_art_gothmagog&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the group helped the gate guard come to a decision on whether giants warranted a Slave duty or a Beast duty by simply paying him for his guard duty (or lack thereof).  They decided to play up the whole spectacle of arriving with captive giants (again, why didn’t I cause more trouble with them, why?) so they hired street performers and tossed out coppers to the crowd and swung torches around and such.  Very prince Ali of them.  Well, Cnud, the seneschal for House Dagaeca is a rather poker-faced chap, so while he was impressed, he didn’t make a big fuss out of it.  He ended up offering the party a fair price (gold = xp for the critters, and they had already received full xp for capturing them) which they accepted on account of prior good relations, even though they were a bit disappointed by the value.  Due to some later events, I may end up helping them out some more from House Dagaeca so that they feel like the relationship is going as well as I mean for it to be so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lepba5a.jpg&#34;&gt;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lepba5a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having offloaded their giants for some sort of amusement, they now decide they need to sell the wine discovered in the cellar with the hideous undead abomination.  They took Cnud’s advice and headed to the wine merchant his kitchen patronizes.  Well, let me just say that the Vornheim shopkeeper table is a lot of fun.  It made the whole business of trying to sell the wine a lot more complicated and interesting than it would have been otherwise. At least, I thought so.  Hopefully the players weren’t just frustrated.  At any rate, the first merchant turned out to offer terrible prices and tried to get the wine for a criminally low price, after helping himself to a bottle to sample.  They realized they were being had due to Sir Varian’s vague alcholic’s knowledge of wine, and so said good day, sir.  The next merchant was a crotchety old man with a monkey, who was just on the verge of giving them a reasonable (but not great) price when they made the mistake of being kind to his monkey.  They figured out their mistake, marched in, roughed up the monkey some and made an offer.  After some consideration, he accepted it, but then they told him they had to think about it (aah, intra-party debates).  Well, they tried one more merchant, and this fellow was an eccentric butterfly collector, but gave them an excellent price in exchange for the promise to bring him any butterfly specimens they find.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/150px-mr-monday.jpg&#34;&gt;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/150px-mr-monday.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the Vornheim shopkeeper chart was a lot of fun and opened the city up to being more characterful and weird than I probably would have let myself do on my own, so I’m grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Yllgrad arranged with an apothecary to have some worg fangs turned into a berserker potion, half paid up front, and half to be paid upon receipt.  The apothecary was a fat, friendly fellow who rather cheerfully dealt with a somewhat dour Yllgrad.  More on him in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party then had the option to rest for the night or to carouse.  Again, I was anxious to flesh out the game and introduce more wacky complications.  Up until this point, I’ve allowed players to blow money willy nilly on booze and wenching in order to convert unwanted gold into xp (we’ve been playing where gold/treasure only earns XP when spent or used, and you only get it once.  There’s some wonky bookkeeping for stuff like fine tapestries decorating their personal home, but it’s been working out).  I wanted carousing to be more interesting, and Jeff Rients’ awesome carousing table seemed to be just the ticket.  Unfortunately, though my players will act all manners of foolhardy in order to obtain gold, they balk in the face of risk in &lt;em&gt;spending&lt;/em&gt; gold.  I worry that it’s a bit fair to be putting strings on spending gold for XP just as they’re getting to the levels where you really need to spend &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to level up, but hopefully this will result in them doing things like getting involved in local politics, building up their town, et cetera.  We’ll see. I also think some of the absent players (Sir Varian’s in particular) will dive right into carousing and potential mishaps with great abandon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/keg_endheader.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/keg_endheader.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;keg_endheader&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my players are chicken and decide to rest peacefully.  Yllgrad awakes to go pick up his potions and finds that poor Hengist – the fat, friendly merchant – has been brutally murdered at his work! Yllgrad looks around for some obvious clues, gathers the partially ground worg fangs, and then notifies a rather dim-witted city guard about the murder, but otherwise decides not to get involved.  Fair enough. For a moment I was afraid that my players, used to plotlines and quests would assume that I was dangling a “necessary” plot opening in front of them and that they would feel obligated to look into this random act of violence in order to find the fun.  I mean, I fully intended to wing an interesting and exciting investigation if they did, and things may still come of all this, but I don’t want to give them the impression that they “ought to have” investigated if they didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others have started the morning by asking after rumors of the Volcano and ships that can take them there.  Earn’s player seems a little bored with the whole “buying rounds of drinks to learn rumors” thing, but the others are doing okay with it.  I end up naming a string of dockside bars after places in Austin (well, two of them, then I had to make up a third because I ran out of plausibly nautical themed names).  Investigating, they heard a number of interesting stories about the Fyrberg (the volcano): there’s a fishing village on the island, they worship the volcano by the name of Gurgu, there’s a giant ruby called the heart of the mountain, it was actually built by a wizard, the priests can make the volcano erupt at will, there’s a demon in the volcano, and so forth.  We’ll have to see how true they turn out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the search for captains, I used the chart at the end of this entry that I came up with to randomly determine some ships’ captains that were in port and looking for work.  They ended up being referred to Acca, an enormously fat merchant with a crack crew and a high price, Guth &amp;amp; Spir, a gruff retired watchman and his sarcastic partner who are rumored to be treasure hunters, and Stol, a nervous, twitchy fellow who works for the great house Anlaf, but will take passengers on the side.  If you use the ship’s captain table, I’m sure you’ll recognize a few of the fellows, but just use names appropriate to your campaign and change a few details and they should fit right in.  Oh, and feel free to make any and all of them women, or randomly determine the sex ahead of time if you so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wrapped up the evening by going back to Cnud and letting him know that maybe Beorn is a bit of a rip off.  Cnud says they’d just always used the guy and he’ll look into it.  I’m sure he’ll be pretty grateful when he discovers one of the reasons his house has had trouble with finances.  They wrapped up the evening and decided that when we come back they’ll talk to the captains and settle on one of them, and then hopefully set sail for Fyrberg and adventure (Earn’s player is really anxious to get to that volcano).     &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/zpage119crop.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/zpage119crop.jpg?w=223&#34; alt=&#34;zpage119crop&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules: Random Ships’ Captains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When characters wish to hire a ship, determine how many options they have/hear about/discover and roll a d12 that many times and consult the chart (or just pick).  If you need more than 12, scratch out any who are used and make up your own. “Base control stat” refers to what the captain and crew as described will need to roll under on a d20 to maintain control in a storm or other special circumstance. This can be modified by player actions, hiring additional/different crew, et cetera. If you have a different system, I arbitrarily decided that 15 was average for a professional captain and went from there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***1)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sober, clean shaven, cautious.  Former smuggler turned honest.  Asks a high price, but crew is very skilled. Base control stat: 18.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***2)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reckless drunk.  Looking for work, unreliable, crew is drunk and unreliable.  He’s cheap, though.  Base control stat: 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***3)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charming smuggler and his mountain of a first mate.  A local crime boss has a bounty on their heads.  His ship is remarkably fast.  Base control stat: 15. Ship speed +5 miles per day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***4)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enormously fat merchant.  Dresses in high style, happy to take on passengers or high-value cargo, employs crack mercenaries as guards.  Expensive, but well connected.  Base control stat: 15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***5)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign, doesn’t speak the language very well.  Finishing up unloading a cargo that turned out unprofitable, sour mood, wants to get the hell out of here.  Base control stat: 14 (10 if crew is local)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***6)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stereotypically piratical.  Y’arrrr, parrot, peg leg/eye patch, flamboyant clothes, you know the guy.  May or may not actually be a pirate. Base control stat: 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***7)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big talker, promises the moon, talks about his extensive exploits at sea.  Just purchased his first ramshackle vessel crewed by rank amateurs.  He starts out high, but can be bargained to extremely low prices.  Base control stat: 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***8)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gruff, bearded retired watchman and his lanky sarcastic partner.  They take the jobs they can get, but mostly are after treasures.  Base control stat: 14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***9)    *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old man with a great big bushy beard injured by a great beast of the waves.  He seeks to hunt it down with a maniacal intensity.  Base control stat: 15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***10) *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee of a great house willing to take some passengers on the side for his own profit.  Thin, nervous, and flighty.  Base control stat: 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***11) *** &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captain is stubborn, quick witted former military officer who just wants his space and his freedom, and won’t look too closely into the legality of a job he takes.  He might have a light hearted pilot, a hard assed female first mate, a cheery female engineer, some hired muscle, and a sheltered surgeon.  Base control stat: 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12) *** *** A cunning and accomplished reaver with a crew of seasoned raiders.  He considers passengers an unworthy source of income, but times are rough.  Base control stat: 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead http://jpowellrussell.com/gaming/2013-05-07-requiescat-in-pace-mr-harryhausen/ -&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up with Harryhausen the way a lot of the folks into this Old School stuff did, but I certainly love and appreciate his work.  And that&amp;rsquo;s why I think that &lt;a href=&#34;http://gamersandgrognards.blogspot.com/2013/05/rip-ray-harryhausen-way-to-honor-him.html&#34;&gt;the idea to make Friday an OSR blogfest&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the late, great Ray Harryhausen is a fantastic one.  So spread the word and tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
