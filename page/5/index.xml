        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2016-06-13-places-of-interest-in-fellhold/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2c/ab/5b/2cab5b15d229d430e5a56741489829d0.jpg&#34;&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2c/ab/5b/2cab5b15d229d430e5a56741489829d0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a few previous posts, I am in the process of pretty extensively overhauling my homebrew setting &lt;em&gt;Fellhold&lt;/em&gt;. As a part of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been drafting some tables to help with stocking the place, which is an enormous, largely ruined city where the dungeon and the urban run together pretty fluidly. Below are the tables for &amp;ldquo;Places of Interest&amp;rdquo;, which are the handful of places within a district likely worth looking into in more detail, also usable to detail out something that catches the players&amp;rsquo; attention in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt owed to &lt;em&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vornheim&lt;/em&gt;, and others like it should be pretty darn clear, but there will be a more extensive bibliography forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place of Interest Generation&lt;/strong&gt;  These tables serve two primary purposes: stocking new districts as part of preparation before play, and creating interesting locations on the fly during play. They are not intended to represent every single building or place within Fellhold, but instead, only the interesting ones. As always, you may use as few or as many columns as needed in a given situation. For example, you might only roll on the column for type of business/housing if your players burst into a random building and wonder what type it is. Note that the results are tilted more towards “interesting and weird” than “verisimilitudinous” - if you desire random buildings of a more mundane sort, I direct you to the great many previous supplements that have covered this, including the author’s own hack of &lt;em&gt;Middenheim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interpreting the results on these tables, as always, consider their physical context. What is the surrounding district? How does this place fit into that? How does it interact with any factions active there, if at all? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;  Places of interest come in three types. Numbers are provided to randomize if you know you need “a place of interest”, but not what sort of place. You may wish to reverse the chances of &lt;em&gt;Lair&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Business &amp;amp; Housing&lt;/em&gt; results in a ruined district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-2: &lt;em&gt;Lair&lt;/em&gt; - something more dangerous than the average inhabitant lives here, and probably has treasure and defenses of some sort.   3-5: &lt;em&gt;Business &amp;amp; Housing&lt;/em&gt; - relatively “normal” buildings of the city, but with something to make them of interest to adventurers.  6: &lt;em&gt;Landmark&lt;/em&gt; - An especially noteworthy place or thing by which inhabitants navigate their district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lairs&lt;/strong&gt;  Lair inhabitants may be tied to a faction if desired, but generally represent more of a “wild card” outside of normal social context, or perhaps a faction of their own. Some will suggest ties to existing factions more than others (criminals, fleshcrafters), while others will stand out as candidates to be factions in their own right (Master Wizards, Bog Mummies). If a random faction is desired, use the same procedure as for any other NPC. For the number appearing, treasure, and other details, refer to the relevant entry in the bestiary. As always, it is left to the enterprising referee to ignore or reconcile any seemingly contradictory or nonsensical results in whichever way best serves their game.  *   *  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business &amp;amp; Housing&lt;/strong&gt;  Note that it is not required, or necessarily desirable, to give this full treatment to every single place of business or housing the players interact with. These tables are more appropriate when preparing a new district’s pre-defined places of interest, if a location is needed for a job, rumor, or conspiracy, when complications arise from the urbancrawl action, or a place is otherwise intended to be a source of ongoing adventure fuel. That being said, if the players are just poking around and have no clear aims in mind, these places can be starting points, suggesting further contacts, jobs, and factional intrigues. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPCs&lt;/em&gt;  Generally you will want to generate the owner/proprietor, or a major inhabitant for any place generated. If other NPCs become relevant, assume a number of people in the site consistent with its purpose and the time of day (a bar might have very few people in the middle of the afternoon and very many late at night, while a warehouse would be the opposite). If not obvious, assume 2d6 inhabitants/customers at any given time. If specific detail is needed, generate using the table for new contacts, but assume their career is tied to the place, unless it makes sense to have all sorts of careers there (like in a bar). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treasure&lt;/em&gt;  Location will have treasure in keeping with the owner/proprietor, multiplied by the appropriate wealth level. Some locations will suggest further treasure (like a bank) and should be stocked accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2016-02-25-exhaustion-is-terrifying/ -&lt;p&gt;A while back, I read this really fascinating book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s this got to do with the D&amp;amp;Ds? I think it would be interesting to link up encumbrance and psychology, specifically fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-awesome-power-of-modular-mechanics-to-the-rescue--im-already-a-fan-of-arnolds-sanity-ruleshttpgoblinpunchblogspotcom201305stark-staring-madhtml-and-you-can-find-my-slight-modification-of-them-with-darkest-dungeon-style-quirks-herehttpblessingsofthedicegodsblogspotcom201503quirks-and-sanityhtml-im-also-already-a-big-fan-of-guss-encumbrance-and-exhaustion-rules-you-can-find-herehttpdungeonofsignsblogspotcom201505dungeon-viddles-hms-apollyon-playershtml-and-brendans-overloaded-encounter-diehttpwwwnecropraxiscom20140203overloading-the-encounter-die-as-filtered-through-guss-exploration-diehttpdungeonofsignsblogspotcom201410hms-apollyon-exploration-rules-and-myhtml-while-i-was-thinking-of-the-rules-ideas-below-it-suddenly-came-to-me-that-combining-these-gives-us-damn-near-everything-we-need-with-very-few-tweaks&#34;&gt;The Awesome Power of Modular Mechanics to the Rescue  I&amp;rsquo;m already a fan of Arnold&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/05/stark-staring-mad.html&#34;&gt;sanity rules&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find my slight modification of them, with Darkest Dungeon style Quirks &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2015/03/quirks-and-sanity.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m also already a big fan of Gus&amp;rsquo;s encumbrance and exhaustion rules you can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2015/05/dungeon-viddles-hms-apollyon-players.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Brendan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/&#34;&gt;Overloaded encounter die&lt;/a&gt;, as filtered through Gus&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2014/10/hms-apollyon-exploration-rules-and-my.html&#34;&gt;Exploration Die&lt;/a&gt;. While I was thinking of the rules ideas below, it suddenly came to me that combining these gives us damn near everything we need, with very few tweaks.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweak 1 is that instead of &amp;ldquo;exhausted&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;encumbered&amp;rdquo; being two separate conditions (as Gus does it), I instead have encumbered characters add an extra exhaustion pip when the exploration die comes up &amp;ldquo;Exhausted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next addition is for Exhausted characters to be more likely to freak out if subjected to stress, and this one&amp;rsquo;s easy: just apply the exhaustion penalty (-4 to all rolls) to the test to avoid a breakdown. If failed, flavor the breakdown more as terror/running away, and less as going nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I toyed with the idea of increasing the number of stress points gained if a character is exhausted, but it seems to make more sense that people are more likely to freak out when exhausted, but not more likely to receive permanent trauma than they otherwise would be. You might consider a lower bar for inflicting a single stress point on exhausted characters, though - those bandits or hobgoblins might not normally cause your steely eyed heroes to flee, but he&amp;rsquo;s too tired to deal with it or think clearly right now. Anyhow here&amp;rsquo;s the rule itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exhaustion-and-stress--characters-that-are-exhausted-apply-the--4-exhaustion-penalty-to-rolls-testing-for-a-breakdown-upon-receiving-stress-points-exhausted-characters-breaking-down-are-more-likely-to-drop-excess-weight-and-run-than-other-kinds-of-breakdowns-some-situations-that-would-not-normally-subject-a-character-to-stress-will-do-so-for-exhausted-characters-at-the-referees-discretion&#34;&gt;Exhaustion and Stress  Characters that are exhausted apply the -4 exhaustion penalty to rolls testing for a breakdown upon receiving stress points. Exhausted characters breaking down are more likely to drop excess weight and run than other kinds of breakdowns. Some situations that would not normally subject a character to stress will  do so for exhausted characters, at the referee&amp;rsquo;s discretion.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-alternative-or-supplementary-approaches--and-i-think-thats-it-for-some-alternate-ideas-on-making-exhaustion-count-for-psychology-if-you-dont-use-the-exploration-die-exhaustion-or-sanity-rules-or-if-you-just-want-a-different-approach-check-these-out-that-i-brainstormed-before-settling-on-the-above-as-my-favorite&#34;&gt;Some Alternative or Supplementary Approaches  And I think that&amp;rsquo;s it! For some alternate ideas on making exhaustion count for psychology if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the exploration die, exhaustion, or sanity rules, or if you just want a different approach check these out that I brainstormed before settling on the above as my favorite:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For hirelings, every level of encumbrance penalizes morale checks by
-1 (alternately, if using a binary encumbrance system, go with -2
for encumbered)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For PC&amp;rsquo;s - you might give monsters that normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have them
&amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; effects, and intensify the effects of already fear-causing
monsters (like the Warhammer progression from Fear to Terror).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhausted or encumbered PCs become subjected to morale checks.
Adjudicating what failed morale means for PCs might be a bit
challenging, but should probably require a retreat (not necessarily
a panicked one) until a major change in situation (get somewhere
safe or allies show up or whatever). Since PCs don&amp;rsquo;t normally have
morale scores,  calculate it with the following: 6 + Level/3,
rounded up, with a max of 10 - or use this table:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 1-3: Morale 7  Level 4-6: Morale 8  Level 7-9: Morale 9  Level 10+: Morale 10&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Make Anything Gameable: Ask What Three Times</title>

        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 11:41:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2016-01-31-how-to-make-anything-gameable-ask-what/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2016-01-31-how-to-make-anything-gameable-ask-what/ -&lt;p&gt;So, I like to get into procedures, techniques, and tactics in a lot of aspects of my life: the nitty gritty, detailed ways to &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; do a particular thing. For some gaming related examples, check out these previous posts: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2013/05/how-to-make-sweet-d100-tables-for-fun.html&#34;&gt;creating d100 tables from media&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-granularity-of-megadungeons.html&#34;&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2013/12/a-procedure-for-off-screen-faction.html&#34;&gt;procedures&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-screen-factions-part-ii-combat.html&#34;&gt;megadungeon&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to talk about today is how to get the most out of mining a book, comic, picture, or whatever for gameable stuff. So, to follow along at home, I’d recommend a cool picture or comic as the easiest to get started with, or you can just read the example I used for myself below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-what-three-times--the-name-of-this-procedure-is-ask-what-three-times-its-inspired-by-the-concept-of-ask-why-three-times-which-motivational-types-use-to-determine-underlying-beliefs-so-were-going-to-adapt-it-to-being-a-useful-textualvisual-analytical-tool&#34;&gt;Ask What Three Times  The name of this procedure is “Ask What Three Times”. It’s inspired by the concept of “Ask Why Three Times”, which motivational types use to determine underlying beliefs. So we’re going to adapt it to being a useful textual/visual analytical tool.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Find a cool piece of inspirational source material.&lt;/em&gt; It doesn’t matter what makes it cool, just something that you like and have an intuition might be applicable to your game/setting/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;What is a cool thing in this material&lt;/em&gt;?” This is the first “what” - here, you look at your source and ask yourself what thing grabbed you that you want to analyze more. For me, it’s usually easiest to identify the “nouns” - people, places, or giant robot apes, but you can also find plots, actions, motivations, or what have you. If you’re using a longer form work like a book or a movie, it might be helpful to narrow down your field of inquiry to just one chapter or page or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;What makes this thing cool&lt;/em&gt;?” Now, take your isolated cool thing and ask yourself what about it is cool. The idea here is to start digging into what was aesthetically appealing to you, and start breaking it down into digestible chunks. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly about verbalizing what you&amp;rsquo;re  responding to about it, without trying to go any &amp;ldquo;deeper&amp;rdquo; into it yet - we&amp;rsquo;ll do that in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;em&gt;What are the bones of this coolness&lt;/em&gt;?” Finally, take the results of step 3 and ask yourself what makes those identified pieces cool. What are they doing functionally? This is where we get a little bit vague, but stick with me. What we want to do here is to look at the structure of the &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; cool thing we’ve been analyzing and get to the more &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; bones of coolness inherent in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Flesh out your own cool thing&lt;/em&gt;. Take your newly discovered bones and build up an in-game-world flesh and blood creation on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example--okay-since-that-was-all-rather-abstract-and-vague-lets-run-through-an-example-using-this-tool&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;  Okay, since that was all rather abstract and vague, let’s run through an example using this tool.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Step 1: **First off, to find my source material, I went to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pinterest.com/jeffpowellrusse/fellhold/&#34;&gt;Pinterest page&lt;/a&gt; where I keep inspirational pictures for Fellhold. Then I found this picture, using a wonderful Google plugin called “&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roll-m/noljjhcdpkdlkjbmfkoilmhmhncelolm?hl=en-US&#34;&gt;Roll M&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Macy, which will randomly select one thing from within a table on a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mpGnaq7kudU/Vq5hN06yJ9I/AAAAAAAAFo8/2pg9VF75hAw/s1600/646fec3d0df11df93dc3bdbf87847e98.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mpGnaq7kudU/Vq5hN06yJ9I/AAAAAAAAFo8/2pg9VF75hAw/s320/646fec3d0df11df93dc3bdbf87847e98.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: What is cool in this picture? Obviously it’s the sweet lava demons, so let’s analyze them. You’ll note that I could have also gone with the action of the painting - giant forms looming over a lone person, or with the architecture, or even the colors. Whatever strikes me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: “What is cool about the sweet lava demons?” Well, they’re giant demons, they’re made of lava, there’s lava flowing into the top of their heads and out of their open mouths, and they have bright lines of molten magma forming intricate patterns in their cooled lava colored skin and horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;: As mentioned, this is where it gets a little more challenging. So we have the specific pieces of the lava demon picture picked apart in step 3, and now we want to go a layer deeper. So, let’s pick each one apart. Why are giant demons cool? They are huge supernatural powers with implicit malicious intent and a place in some kind of cosmic/supernatural structure. Being made of lava is cool because it’s an element, and it’s fiery and dangerous and bright. Plus it’s cool and weird that it’s a material that’s changed state in an uncommon way - liquid rock. The lava flowing into them and out of their mouths is cool because at the same time it suggests they are vessels of some external power and require an external power source, while also visually showing them literally overflowing with that power. It’s uncontained. Finally, the intricate patterns of bright magma on dark cooled-lava skin. The inherent contrast of orange and dark, cool gray is a pleasing complementary color, but also, the patterns themselves look artificial, like something consciously created. So to see them on a “living” being makes it look unnatural and magical. And patterns might imply some kind of control or binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;: The really easy cheat for this particular step would be to say “wow, now that I know more about these lava demons, I’ll happily use them in my game!”  There’s nothing wrong with this method, and in many ways it is the heart of D&amp;amp;D from the earliest days, but that would make for a poor example, so instead, lets take those bones from step 4 and flesh them out. To summarize, here are our bones:  - Huge malicious supernatural power  - Tied to some larger cosmic/supernatural structure  - Dangerous, visually striking element  - Uncommon state change  - Vessels overflowing with external source of power  - Intricate intentional patterns on a living thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fellhold, there are demons everywhere, and they vary wildly in size and power. All of them are willing to bargain, but fundamentally alien to humans and at least borderline hostile. Some are former servants of the dead gods, others the primordial outsiders that incited the murder of the gods, and some are the ghosts of people who won’t let go of their lifetime obsessions. (Supernatural structure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear King is an especially powerful one of these demons. A nature spirit, it was warped and twisted by the godsdeath, and now it views humanity as arrogant meddlers and dangerous loose cannons. (Malicious supernatural power). It takes the form of an enormous gray grizzly (dangerous, visual striking element) covered in moss, but strangely elongated and sinuous (uncommon state change). From it’s head grows a crown of the broken bones of the people it has eaten, covered in an endless knotwork design of blood (intricate patterns). It’s maw is constantly covered in gore, and the more it eats, the more powerful it becomes (overflowing with external source of power).  ###    &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;  So, there you have it. Not the world’s best monster by any means, but it only took me about 20 minutes to break down and build up something more original that feels like it has a home in my world, while still capturing what grabbed me about the picture in the first place. If you want to play around with this technique, here’s some advanced variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through Steps 1-4 on two or more things, and then combine some or
all of the bones in Step 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purposely select a genre/source wildly outside of your game world’s
feel and milieu - use sci-fi or a romance novel or something for
your fantasy world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a different criteria than “cool” for doing your analysis -
maybe scary, or weird, or sad or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>&#34;Review of The Pale Lady&#34; and &#34;The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man&#34;</title>
        <link>/gaming/2015-07-13-review-of-pale-lady-and-squid-cabal-and/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2015 23:32:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2015-07-13-review-of-pale-lady-and-squid-cabal-and/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-07-13-review-of-pale-lady-and-squid-cabal-and/ -&lt;p&gt;So, a couple of adventures that were add-ons to the &lt;em&gt;Better than Any Man&lt;/em&gt; kickstarter have been published in the last few months, and I picked them both up today: &lt;em&gt;The Pale Lady&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/108448112033159270812&#34;&gt;+Zzarchov Kowolski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man&lt;/em&gt; by Andre Novoa. Since both are rather brief, and since I got both at the same time, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double feature review, especially since there&amp;rsquo;s some nice compare and contrast items. As with previous reviews, I will follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/113442337943907897939&#34;&gt;+Gus L&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s lead in format and approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers follow! So turn back if you plan on playing either of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pale-lady&#34;&gt;The Pale Lady&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E285HnrlumQ/VaRsgx0VZcI/AAAAAAAAEow/m7h24Ifoa2Q/s1600/145008.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E285HnrlumQ/VaRsgx0VZcI/AAAAAAAAEow/m7h24Ifoa2Q/s320/145008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-good&#34;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adventure is written in Zzarchov’s usually enjoyable writing style - brief, readable, just a hint of silliness, but with his usual “actually darker than you might think” treatment of subjects. It is admirably concise and the set up is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout is clean and easy to read, and the art is somewhat sparse but attractive and evocative. It reminds me of WFRP art in a good way. More importantly, all of the content is admirably concise, focusing on what&amp;rsquo;s interesting and necessary for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pale Lady is an interesting and well done version of the “aloof, amoral faerie” that I rather like. Spending the night with the Pale Lady is at once mechanically significant, creepy, gross, and “magical”, so well done there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Pale Lady&amp;rsquo;s creepiness, the Rabbit Men are wonderfully creepy and disturbing, and the whole concept of children abducted, neutered, and enslaved if they aren’t sacrificed in a ritual? Yikes (in a good way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror claiming it is Lucifer is an interesting choice. I find this a much more compelling and useful “unreliable narrator” situation than the poor crazy guy at the beginning of the adventure, where gamer sense will figure out you should believe him pretty quick, unless you constantly screw with your players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the lines of the Lucifer bit, I like the possibly-divine take on the Word of Creation. The benefits are mechanically interesting and do a good job of conveying the flavor of “divine knowledge beyond normal mortal comprehension” - but then, I’m a sucker for the concept of magic = divine language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also nice that there are multiple ways to “win” this adventure, depending on what the players define as a “win” (save the slaves, figure out the cube, loot the place, kill the scary elf witch, et cetera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, this is one of the more directly usable LotFP modules, even if you aren’t hardcore into the &amp;ldquo;LotFP adventure ethos&amp;rdquo;, while still retaining the feeling of creepy weirdness. It also is perhaps more “modular” than many LotFP (or other) adventures, being neatly set apart from normal reality, easily engaged with to a varying degree, and then never dealt with again if desired. So, it&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to drop some weirdness into your campaign without committing to possible apocalypse-level events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bad--in-an-rpg-im-not-sure-how-much-mileage-youll-get-out-of-the-unreliable-narrator-as-quest-giver-idea---your-players-will-be-inclined-to-believe-that-crazy-crap-is-real-especially-in-the-context-of-someone-telling-them-about-a-possible-adventure-its-an-interesting-concept-but-i-dont-know-how-interesting-or-useful-it-would-be-at-the-table&#34;&gt;The Bad  In an RPG, I’m not sure how much mileage you’ll get out of the “unreliable narrator as quest-giver” idea - your players will be inclined to believe that crazy crap is real, especially in the context of someone telling them about a possible adventure. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting concept, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how interesting or useful it would be at the table.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, not sure how I feel about the fake “reward” offered in the form of the not-really-magical sword the nuns have. It totally makes sense, and the adventure offers plenty of other payoffs, but it feels a bit “gotcha” to me, with very little information given to the players to inform their decision as to whether it&amp;rsquo;s something they might want to undertake an adventure to get until it&amp;rsquo;s too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Pale Lady&amp;rsquo;s estate, my main issue is with the structure of the main puzzle. The library and laboratory offer a few clues on the cube, but it still feels a bit like a one-solution puzzle - ask the Pale Lady or you&amp;rsquo;re screwed. But maybe I’m not crediting player ingenuity given the available clues enough. Plus, getting inside the cube is hardly &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; so maybe it ought to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the cube, I’m a little torn on what seems to be the central “Gimmick” of the adventure - on the one hand, it’s an interesting philosophical issue, but on the other, I don’t know how much bringing it up will add to a game or group dynamic, but on the other other hand, I did rather enjoy the conundrum in &lt;em&gt;The Prestige&lt;/em&gt;, so maybe I ought to just appreciate this. I guess my main concern is that the philosophical debate that I totally agree is likely to happen at the table might not actually make the &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; of sitting around the table with your friends pretending to be elves and magic users and what not any better. But maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have a broad enough idea of what the game is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-would-change-to-run-it--honestly-i-dont-think-much-needs-changing-here-for-most-settings-in-the-re-reboot-of-my-own-fellhold-setting-that-i-am-currently-working-on-i-dont-think-there-are-elvesfairies-nor-is-there-a-proper-right-church-so-the-pale-lady-becomes-either-a-demon-or-a-massively-powerful-witch-i-probably-keep-her-rabbit-men-rabbits-for-the-sake-of-creepiness-goats-could-work-too-but-would-have-less-incongruity-to-trade-on-and-the-divine-word-cube-would-become-some-kind-of-runic-object-probably-a-relic-of-giants-or-greater-demons-id-play-the-crazy-quest-giver-more-for-pity-than-for-hes-nuts-yo-and-id-either-stress-the-poorness-of-the-quest-encouraging-nuns-or-else-give-their-offered-treasure-some-benefit-or-maybe-offset-it-by-combining-it-with-some-tangible-benefit-with-being-high-in-the-nuns-books-as-do-gooders&#34;&gt;What I Would Change to Run It  Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think much needs changing here for most settings. In the re-reboot of my own Fellhold setting that I am currently working on, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are elves/fairies, nor is there a proper &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; church. So, the Pale Lady becomes either a demon or a massively powerful witch, I probably keep her Rabbit Men rabbits for the sake of creepiness (goats could work too, but would have less incongruity to trade on), and the Divine Word cube would become some kind of runic object, probably a relic of giants or greater demons. I&amp;rsquo;d play the crazy quest giver more for pity than for &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s nuts, yo&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;d either stress the poorness of the quest-encouraging nuns, or else give their offered treasure some benefit (or maybe offset it by combining it with some tangible benefit with being high in the Nuns&amp;rsquo; books as do-gooders). &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, though, one of the best things I can say about this module is that I don&amp;rsquo;t think most campaigns would have to change much to use it, but it manages to do that without feeling generic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-good--first-off-i-rather-like-the-choice-of-material---ever-since-i-read-neal-stephensons-baroque-cycle-ive-had-a-soft-spot-for-these-characters-and-this-time-period-further-i-also-rather-like-foucalts-pendulum-and-of-course-mr-lovecraft-so-the-stated-influences-for-this-adventure-hit-a-significant-portion-of-my-buttons-it-helps-matters-that-the-writing-is-friendly-and-conversational-with-just-a-hint-of-not-quite-native-speaker-that-adds-to-the-perceived-enthusiasm-and-charm-of-the-text-its-obvious-that-the-author-andre-novoa-genuinely-cares-about-this-adventure-and-wants-you-to-have-a-good-time-with-it-and-thats-nice&#34;&gt;The Good  First off, I rather like the choice of material - ever since I read Neal Stephenson’s &lt;em&gt;Baroque Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve had a soft spot for these characters and this time period. Further, I also rather like &lt;em&gt;Foucalt’s Pendulum&lt;/em&gt; and of course Mr. Lovecraft, so the stated influences for this adventure hit a significant portion of my buttons. It helps matters that the writing is friendly and conversational with just a hint of “not quite native speaker” that adds to the perceived enthusiasm and charm of the text. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that the author, Andre Novoa, genuinely cares about this adventure and wants you to have a good time with it, and that&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look and feel is pretty good, with well chosen fonts and decorative elements, even if nothing in the font choices or layout jumps out and makes me go &amp;ldquo;yes! this is the best ever!&amp;rdquo; Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/106317332650989453289&#34;&gt;+Kelvin Green&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s illustrations work well with the feel of the adventure and look good where they&amp;rsquo;re placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that the set up for the adventure is “here’s three guys and three places, here’s their relationship, and here’s a reason for the players to get involved. Go!” Andre takes some time to tell you not to sweat any particular way for this charged situation to play out, and to roll with whatever develops in play. That&amp;rsquo;s nice. It’s an excellent example of a situation presented, rather than a plot, &lt;a href=&#34;http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots&#34;&gt;to reference the Alexandrian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the facts about the setting (late 18th century England) presented as sidebars - they&amp;rsquo;re useful if you want them, but not stuff you have to memorize to run the adventure successfully. And none of the detail given is stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to play. As a quick aside, English currency is made of madness. Clearly, the inclusion thereof is meant to further the Lovecraftian vibe. Seriously, though, even though I am someone who values the more naturalistic English/Imperial/Standard units of measurement over the soulless and foul Metric system, my American brain just flat out can’t understand His/Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Currency - which is perhaps ironic, given Mr. Newton’s later role as master of the Royal Mint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, returning to the adventure, the imaginary cabal is a pretty nice touch, especially since there is a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; secret organization with similar (but by no means identical) goals to the imaginary one. I’m not positive how much the players will get out of this distinction, though, unless they end up chumming up with Newton as well as conducting a lot of investigation. Still it provides a nice roleplaying cue for Newton - paranoid, jumping at ghosts everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the real secret organization, I like the brain-stealing cult quite a bit, and I enjoy their being tied into historical acts of lost knowledge, but I feel like worshipping space squids was the low-hanging fruit in the Lovecraftian orchard. For my tastes, a Mi-Go rip off would have been more fitting, that is if you’re bent on using the trappings of a familiar Lovecraftian beastie. You could always take the approach of some other LotFP modules and use the &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt; of cosmic horror with some wholly new monsters/creatures/situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, moving into the adventure locations, Kelvin’s maps are fantastic. I’ve grown to appreciate them even more since I’ve (partially) run Forgive Us for my home group. Also, it is definitely appreciated that they don’t waste space describing normal rooms or regular house stuff - the detailed maps do all of that detail for you, and it works. Only the rooms/stuff that matters gets called out in the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hah! While we&amp;rsquo;re talking about keys, in Newton&amp;rsquo;s secret Alchemical laboratory, there&amp;rsquo;s Easter Eggs! &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Quicksilver&lt;/em&gt; by Stefan Nilsson indeed. (&lt;em&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/em&gt; was the first book of &lt;em&gt;The Baroque Cycle&lt;/em&gt; by Neal Stephenson I mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, in Newton&amp;rsquo;s reproduction of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Temple, the fact that how the secret doors are hidden and how to activate them is described is a nice touch. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some more thoughts on the temple below, and if you look at the whole thing as  just some bonus material, I guess it’s alright, but I gotta admit, I had a few more negative things to say than positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping ahead to the evil cult&amp;rsquo;s temple, I rather like the sphere room, both the image and the weird effects. . . except for the “you’re an evil cultist now, have fun with that!” result. Maybe it’s fitting for LotFP, but somehow this seems worse than either “you’re dead” or “you’re crazy” as the result of a die roll for &amp;ldquo;doing what the game is about&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;interacting with the space you&amp;rsquo;re exploring.&amp;rdquo; Again, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t get the LotFP ethos, but it just seems kinda screwjobby to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and the mummy squids are a pretty cool monster, as is the watchful squid in the walls of the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this adventure has a fantastic set up and a lot of really inventive concepts/ideas, but unfortunately, there were some downsides that  I dive into in the next section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bad--despite-the-fact-that-i-love-the-voice-of-the-writing-i-feel-like-the-text-could-have-used-a-slightly-harsher-content-edit---often-there-were-times-that-the-text-was-lengthier-and-more-detailed-than-necessary---such-as-providing-referee-advice-now-maybe-im-just-too-steeped-day-to-day-in-osr-referee-philosophy-because-i-didnt-think-any-of-the-advice-was-bad-i-just-felt-like-i-didnt-need-it-in-an-adventure-maybe-if-it-were-packaged-as-part-of-an-intro-box-but-as-a-stand-alone-adventure-i-found-a-lot-of-the-basically-sound-obviously-well-meaning-advice-to-be-unnecessary-filler&#34;&gt;The Bad  Despite the fact that I love the &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo; of the writing, I feel like the text could have used a slightly harsher content edit - often, there were times that the text was lengthier and more detailed than necessary - such as providing referee advice. Now, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just too steeped day-to-day in OSR referee philosophy, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t think any of the advice was &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, I just felt like I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it &lt;em&gt;in an adventure&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe if it were packaged as part of an intro box, but as a stand alone adventure, I found a lot of the basically sound, obviously well meaning advice to be unnecessary filler.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the “running the adventure” section strikes me as overly wordy/detailed at best, and unnecessary at worst. As I said, all of the advice is well meaning and pretty much totally correct, just maybe extraneous. I will say though, why on earth are the dice generators in this section presented in paragraphs!? Gah! They are clearly tables in all but form. That’s just bad information presentation. By all means present them in a paragraph, as long as you show them as a table again later. It’s a shame, because these are immediately useful (if pretty basic) tables for helping the situation to be dynamic as the players come into it. More of this sort of thing would have made for an even tastier adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were one or two areas where I felt like some advice to the referee specific to the adventure would have come in handy. For example, near the beginning of the adventure, the idea is presented that the “real treasure” is knowledge, rather than gold/silver, but then it gives no guidance on how to tweak LotFP’s Silver-for-XP system. Sure, any referee with some experience under their belt can figure something out, and later on, guidelines are given on how to monetize some of the esoteric knowledge uncovered, but if you are going to specifically write an adventure to go against the standard written into the game rules and proven valuable over decades of play, some guidance would be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with this very concept in my &lt;em&gt;Heresies Without Number&lt;/em&gt; game, because providing indirect, fungible/holographic incentives to advancement is a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; robust reward mechanic. Anyway, I think overall it works out okay, but some more thoughts on how this sets up an intrigue based game, or how the players can gain fictional (but non-experience/treasure based) advantages in the game world would have been nice in an adventure that seems to go to some lengths to discourage standard &amp;ldquo;steal everything not nailed down&amp;rdquo; play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, getting back to the details of the adventure - it strikes me as a bit wacky that all of the dramatis personae are such hard SOBs. Even Hooke is a 2HD mofo. I get that Halley is a secret sorcerous cultist, so his improved stats make sense, but Hooke and Newton having 2HD seems not to jive with the usual LotFP “everyone is normal except the PCs” approach. I almost wish Andre took it to 11 and made all 3 or them secretly hard ass former adventurers, even if that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very historically congruent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I mentioned Kelvin&amp;rsquo;s delightful maps, but I wish Mr. Novoa and Mr. Jagosz had consulted him on the text and layout of the map keys as well. While it&amp;rsquo;s appreciated that mundane rooms are left undetailed except in the broadest of strokes, the &amp;ldquo;interesting room&amp;rdquo; key entries are still somewhat wordy and they fail to fall into Mr. Green&amp;rsquo;s wonderful &amp;ldquo;one building, one spread&amp;rdquo; layout from &lt;em&gt;Forgive Us&lt;/em&gt;. Just a hair more discipline there would have been greatly appreciated, even if the &amp;ldquo;crawling&amp;rdquo; the locations is not the focus of play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of locations, neither Hooke’s house nor Newton&amp;rsquo;s as locations offer a ton of interest. I feel like more clues as to their enmity, madness and paranoia, and/or contact with Halley would be useful. As it is, neither of these locations give much reason to &amp;ldquo;crawl&amp;rdquo; them, and I&amp;rsquo;d probably condense most of the action in them into a pretty abstract terms. Probably even for Halley&amp;rsquo;s House and the Observatory, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of breaking and entering in early Natural Philosophers&amp;rsquo; homes, I’m torn on Newton’s (possible) employment of Ryan O’Flannagan. On the one hand, having a hard bastard come after you because you stole from a rich and paranoid guy makes a lot of sense. On the other, it feels a bit like a “gotcha” for PCs doing what PCs do - robbing a place blind because somebody asked them to. I think I would rather see the threat of this happening telegraphed a little more clearly - give the players a chance to find out that Newton will go to any length, even questionably legal ones, to recover things he considers important, or rumors that he’s been beefing up his security, or whatever. My main issue is not the severity of the consequence, but rather its inability to be anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, while we&amp;rsquo;re on the topic of &amp;ldquo;crawling&amp;rdquo; these locations, the replica Temple of Solomon under Newton’s mansion strikes me as something of a missed opportunity. See, I love that the temple replica is there, given (real, historical) Newton&amp;rsquo;s interest in alchemy and Solomon&amp;rsquo;s temple, but the problem is, there’s not actually, you know, much to do down there, or much of value to find. Certainly almost no leads into further adventure. Just a couple of double-secret treasures/easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the actual physical format of it, I’m not thrilled with the well entrance to the temple. The key being literally the only way in there is kind of weak, especially when you consider that key is also in a secret room the players will have no particular reason to find, unless they are lucky or careful mappers. Add on to this that if you do figure out the key situation, you get gassed and Newton will get you executed if he finds you, it seems like an overly bottlenecky kind of thing, especially for a not very valuable, not important at all to the &amp;ldquo;main plot&amp;rdquo; kind of location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on! Replica &lt;em&gt;Temple of Solomon&lt;/em&gt;.  In he basement of the &lt;em&gt;greatest natural philosopher of his age.&lt;/em&gt; This is a solid gold idea that gets maybe a bronze treatment. It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, it just &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, moving on to Greenwich Observatory, which gives the impression of being the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; adventure site (which I think is sadly back-tracking from the awesomeness of the &amp;ldquo;three guys, three places, one conflict&amp;rdquo; set up the adventure began with). I’m not a big fan of Flamsteed being 100% reticent to talk unless the players convince him they’re “experienced enough” - I think a better approach here would be to just qualitatively describe him as terrified and afraid to talk to anybody, then let the referee decide how easily (or not) he’ll open up. Really commit to &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s the pieces, you figure out what happens&amp;rdquo; rather than trying to push any particular reactions or storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the telescope-entrance to the temple seems waaaay too fiddly. I’m fine with needing to know what star to point it towards, considering there’s still another way in to find or that the players could just crowbar/sledgehammer the stone blocking the entrance, but the fact that they need to find the information about Lyra and then still have a lengthy, boring fiddling around with it to get it right? That doesn’t strike me as a fun kind of puzzle - it strikes me as more of a pixel-bitchy kind of puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the party gets down to the evil temple, the dungeon itself is totally linear. Sure, going in the temple at all is not technically “required” for the adventure, but it’s obviously where almost all of the fun weirdness is, so it’d be nice if it were slightly more compelling as a map. And again, the locations are presented in standard prose form, with parenthetical references to map locations. It&amp;rsquo;s not very helpful for reference or ease of access, and the good stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t really highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another specific callout, the cube puzzle strikes me as way too many blind, uninformed decisions unless you found one elusive clue in the house, and even then, you might mess it up. It’d maybe be okay for experimentation, except there’s a huge number of possible combinations, so it’s not really realistic to expect the players to figure out any “rules” in any kind of reasonable amount of time. So this leads to non-meaningful guessing, boring choices, and a puzzle that pisses off more than it tantalizes. I can certainly get behind the inspiration for this section of the dungeon, but I think it deserves its own entire adventure where figuring out &amp;ldquo;The Cube&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;the whole point&lt;/em&gt; with lots o ftime and tries and more clues on how to make it work. As it stands, it&amp;rsquo;s more likely for the party to get stuck and super frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-would-change-to-run-it--so-what-would-i-change-to-run-this-first-off-id-give-each-of-the-three-main-figures-some-even-stronger-personality-cues-and-then-leave-it-up-to-what-the-players-do-to-figure-out-how-they-interact-id-probably-also-leave-it-ambiguous-whether-newton-really-had-stolen-hookes-formulas-just-to-make-it-more-interesting-id-insert-some-more-interest-into-each-location---id-give-hooke-some-kind-of-tenuous-social-connections-play-up-newton-spiraling-into-a-connection-with-shady-elements-and-then-put-a-few-more-cult-clues-into-halleys-house&#34;&gt;What I Would Change to Run It  So, what would I change to run this? First off, I&amp;rsquo;d give each of the three main figures some even stronger personality cues, and then leave it up to what the players do to figure out how they interact. I&amp;rsquo;d probably also leave it ambiguous whether Newton really had stolen Hooke&amp;rsquo;s formulas (just to make it more interesting). I&amp;rsquo;d insert some more interest into each location - I&amp;rsquo;d give Hooke some kind of tenuous social connections, play up Newton spiraling into a connection with shady elements, and then put a few more cult clues into Halley&amp;rsquo;s house. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d make Newton&amp;rsquo;s Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Temple more interesting - probably a caged demon down there, definitely some rituals you can accidentally trigger just by moving through it. I&amp;rsquo;d also make it a little easier to get into without Newton having you murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d probably also add in the Royal Society as a form of forced interaction between all of these personalities, a way for the players to meet more weirdos, and a source for further adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;d redesign the creepy cult and their temple. Mi-Go (bugs, fungus) instead of tentacle everything, a more Jaquayed dungeon, and I&amp;rsquo;d probably greatly simplify &amp;ldquo;The Cube&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion--so-overall-i-think-i-found-pale-ladya-more-immediately-useful-module-but-the-squid-the-cabal-and-the-old-manhas-a-lot-of-promise-in-its-fundamental-concept-it-just-would-have-benefited-from-being-maybe-half-as-long-despite-the-fact-that-pale-ladywould-be-easier-to-use-as-isi-see-it-as-more-likely-that-ill-modify-the-basic-structure-of-scom-to-my-game-than-that-ill-use-pale-ladyat-all&#34;&gt;Conclusion  So, overall, I think I found &lt;em&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/em&gt; a more immediately useful module, but &lt;em&gt;The Squid, the Cabal, and the Old Man&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of promise in its fundamental concept, it just would have benefited from being maybe half as long. Despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/em&gt; would be easier to use as is, I see it as more likely that I&amp;rsquo;ll modify the basic structure of SCOM to my game than that I&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;em&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the price, both are pretty well worth checking out. &lt;em&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/em&gt; is a better bet if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a true &amp;ldquo;module&amp;rdquo; that you can drop into any existing game with minimal fuss, while SCOM is a richer vein of mineable ideas. Do what you will with that, and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

I totally forgot to give a shout out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/107363765497271284541&#34;&gt;+Mateo Diaz Torres&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gloomtrain.blogspot.com/search/label/Pernicious%20Albion&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pernicious Albion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; setting, which is just awful, since I&amp;rsquo;m helping with layout on its upcoming publication. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic stuff. I also neglected to mention &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/103464603741728371942&#34;&gt;+Courtney Campbell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/search/label/Numenhalla&#34;&gt;Numenhalla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or upcoming &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/search/label/Perdition&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; settings, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve read lots of Numenhalla posts for megadungeon inspiration, and Perdition sounds like it will be pretty rocking. Finally, in the published space, I forgot to direct your attention to the very fine &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/89888/Red-Tide-Campaign-Sourcebook-and-Sandbox-Toolkit&#34;&gt;Red Tide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/115055273425645223134&#34;&gt;+Kevin Crawford&lt;/a&gt; . As with all of his stuff, it is chock full of material that has its own strong flavor, but is easily modified to any genre or setting. Go check all of those out if you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that we have my foolishness out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s get back to the topic at hand. We’ve gone through the second edition campaign settings and a handful of OSR settings and figured out what makes them compelling (or at least, elements of what makes them compelling). So now I want to take the descriptive stuff we’ve identified and turn it into prescriptive advice on how to create a campaign setting that grabs people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-do--http3bpblogspotcom-na7rji5mliivx-rtuxmewiaaaaaaaaemurvuesrewbhys320rikusjpghttp3bpblogspotcom-na7rji5mliivx-rtuxmewiaaaaaaaaemurvuesrewbhys1600rikusjpg--have-a-strong-guiding-aesthetic-a-lot-of-what-made-the-2e-settings-great-boils-down-to-having-a-really-clear-aesthetic-and-communicating-it-effectively-the-theme-art-direction-and-even-focusing-play-on-different-things-all-revolve-around-the-setting-doing-something-to-your-imagination-that-standard-dd-doesnt-do-dark-sun-lives-in-a-different-part-of-my-brain-than-orcs-and-goblins-and-such-like-it-evokes-a-different-emotional-response-and-encourages-different-adventures-and-different-player-decisions-to-fit-into-this-different-aesthetic-this-point-is-at-once-the-most-obvious-and-probably-the-hardest-to-follow-well&#34;&gt;What to Do  &lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Na7RjI5mLII/VX-rtUXMeWI/AAAAAAAAEmU/rvuesrEwbhY/s1600/Rikus.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Na7RjI5mLII/VX-rtUXMeWI/AAAAAAAAEmU/rvuesrEwbhY/s320/Rikus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Have a Strong Guiding Aesthetic&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of what made the 2E settings great boils down to having a really clear aesthetic and communicating it effectively. The theme, art direction, and even focusing play on different things all revolve around the setting doing something to your imagination that standard D&amp;amp;D doesn’t do. Dark Sun lives in a different part of my brain than orcs and goblins and such like. It evokes a different emotional response and encourages different adventures and different player decisions to fit into this different aesthetic. This point is at once the most obvious and probably the hardest to follow well.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the way to make this advice practical is to use the different lenses we identified in previous posts, but consciously think about how to link them. Does your setting have a theme? What about some distinctly different play style? Art and art direction? Look at these separately, but then come back to “what ties all of these together?” It’s hard to articulate, but I think you can probably go pretty far with “do these go together?”  Trust your tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qwZdIdwljkc/VX-sNI9wiSI/AAAAAAAAEmk/TTSC6P-V89I/s1600/Harmonium_Patrol_by_Tony_Diterlizzi-2611_%25281995%2529_TSR_Planescape_-_The_Factol%2527s_Manifesto.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qwZdIdwljkc/VX-sNI9wiSI/AAAAAAAAEmk/TTSC6P-V89I/s320/Harmonium_Patrol_by_Tony_Diterlizzi-2611_%25281995%2529_TSR_Planescape_-_The_Factol%2527s_Manifesto.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the Right Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;: So, I struggled a bit here with the right wording, but the idea is that you need some mechanical differentiation, but not a whole new game. In the Clone-crowded world of the OSR, it might be difficult to select an official rule system with which to be compatible, but the good news is that most OSR folks are well aware of the inter-operability of the wide variety of clones and rules sets. So honestly, if most of your mechanics can slot into “basically D&amp;amp;D” you’ll be alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say “the Right Mechanics” I mean that you need some rules that reinforce the aesthetic you’ve developed (like a Crab People Race/Class for &lt;em&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/em&gt;), but that aren’t so wild and involved that you’re pitching a whole new game. I suspect there are a couple of dials and knobs you can play around with here. For example, you can probably include a lot more new DM-facing rules than player-facing rules, because DMs are crazy people who hoard rules like Scrooge McDuck does coins. Likewise, the more central a thing is to answering “what’s new and exciting about this setting?”, the more you can probably introduce new rules. Super involved social conflict rules would make sense in a world of exaggerated courtly intrigue, but would be annoying extra-fiddliness in a world of large scale military command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I34xDkp3adU/VX-tOtdN2BI/AAAAAAAAEms/aB_xME7qG5E/s1600/TSR3100_Birthright_Campaign_Setting.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-I34xDkp3adU/VX-tOtdN2BI/AAAAAAAAEms/aB_xME7qG5E/s320/TSR3100_Birthright_Campaign_Setting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the World a Canvas&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ll note that I didn’t say a blank canvas. The idea here is that you want DMs and players to feel like they make a difference on the world. Or at a minimum that if they aren’t going to change the world, they’ll have agency to make their own decisions that matter. The difficulty is in striking a balance between details that give people something to latch onto and drowning them in padding that feels like a straight jacket. One traditional approach is to just go sparse. To make up for the sparseness, many settings spread out and give you a lot of minimal details over a wide area. This bigness is one way to leave lots of blank space for DMs to exercise their creativity and for players to make their mark on. I imagine you can still make a world that feels open to player agency with lots of tightly packed detail, but it might be harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments on the second post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/108797699252182219631&#34;&gt;+George S Hammond&lt;/a&gt;  asked a question that made me think harder about the distinction between &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; in the world and people and events in the world, and why detail in one is more likely to be better than in the other. What I realized is that places, things, and cultures in the world are much less likely to impact the agency of PCs than people or events. The worst risk they run is being boring or overly detailed. People and events, though, they act &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; PCs, rather than being static things &lt;em&gt;on which&lt;/em&gt; the PCs can act. So it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have people or events, it&amp;rsquo;s just that they have a higher risk of constraining PC agency, and so should be used with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the events and people of the world, I think that settings do better to limit themselves to history and the current state and to strictly avoid intentions and what “will” happen. Getting into plans and intentions for NPCs and factions is probably better handled in adventures, where the players’ involvement is assumed, and changes to the NPCs’ plans are expected. I think that the creators of a lot of settings have felt the need to fill it in with a bunch of proto-adventures. This makes sense on first blush, but I think creators do better to instead focus on making an interesting world full of interesting stuff chock full of potential without committing any of it to a particular expected course of interesting events. Rather than &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d argue it&amp;rsquo;s best to prepare &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt; for NPCs. Not the actions the NPC will take, but rather the things that they want. That way, how those interests translate into action, and more importantly, how that action interacts with the PCs, is more flexible and more in the hands of the GM and the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-txLgtMZLNhE/VX-uBN9RKpI/AAAAAAAAEm8/LdiNI5-0KC0/s1600/SpelljammerAdventuresInSpaceBox.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-txLgtMZLNhE/VX-uBN9RKpI/AAAAAAAAEm8/LdiNI5-0KC0/s1600/SpelljammerAdventuresInSpaceBox.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Your Jam On&lt;/strong&gt;: As an independent creator, you are in a unique position to get the best of “jamming” and ignore the evils of “design by committee”. You have access to blogs, Google+, Fora, and an enormous back catalog of inspirational material. So you can pull in good ideas from other people, bounce your own ideas off of other people and see how they come back different, and even solicit entirely new contributions. On the other hand, you’re running your own show, so you don’t have to worry about corporate telling you what they think will sell best or Steve over in accounting saying that you can’t afford that art you love. All of the access to multiple creative minds, none of the obligation to water down your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-avoid--http3bpblogspotcom-ymhzydk7qlwvx-tutdzn6iaaaaaaaaem0othoqqg3jvss1600546987-mjpg-------padding-this-one-is-easy-to-say-but-hard-to-do-the-only-real-guideline-to-what-you-should-include-and-what-you-should-cut-out-is-taste-but-there-are-a-few-questions-you-can-ask-yourself-when-casting-a-critical-eye-over-your-work-does-this-contribute-to-the-central-aesthetic-is-this-new-or-different-in-some-way-can-i-find-almost-exactly-the-same-thing-somewhere-else-can-smart-readers-figure-this-outmake-their-own-decision-is-it-something-that-players-are-likely-to-find-out-and-act-on-if-not-is-it-something-that-will-excite-the-dm-enough-to-come-up-with-things-that-the-players-will-find-out-and-act-on-is-it-something-that-provides-players-with-choicesdoes-this-enhance-or-detract-from-player-agency&#34;&gt;What to Avoid  &lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YmHZYDK7Qlw/VX-tuTdZN6I/AAAAAAAAEm0/oTHOqqg3JVs/s1600/546987-M.jpg&#34;&gt;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YmHZYDK7Qlw/VX-tuTdZN6I/AAAAAAAAEm0/oTHOqqg3JVs/s1600/546987-M.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Padding&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is easy to say, but hard to do. The only real guideline to what you should include and what you should cut out is taste, but there are a few questions you can ask yourself when casting a critical eye over your work: Does this contribute to the central aesthetic? Is this new or different in some way? Can I find almost exactly the same thing somewhere else? Can smart readers figure this out/make their own decision? Is it something that players are likely to find out and act on? If not, is it something that will excite the DM enough to come up with things that the players will find out and act on? Is it something that provides players with choices?﻿ Does this enhance or detract from player agency?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you should try to filter every sentence you write through the guidelines to a good and interesting campaign setting. I have found in my own editing work that it usually pays to be harsher than you think necessary and cut out more than you think you can. I always just remind myself that I’m writing for a smart audience, and if something is unclear or mysterious, DMs are good at making stuff up to fill in gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FW9HkprlmJg/VX-vYvTURDI/AAAAAAAAEnU/aygHIldlViQ/s1600/DLC1_TSR9291_Dragonlance_Classics_Volume_1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FW9HkprlmJg/VX-vYvTURDI/AAAAAAAAEnU/aygHIldlViQ/s320/DLC1_TSR9291_Dragonlance_Classics_Volume_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling Adventure Hooks Setting&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is more of a hunch of mine I’ve come to while writing this series, but I think I’m on to something. For the reasons outlined above, adventure hooks imply a certain presumption on the DM’s prep, and even a bit of presumption on the player’s agency. I think including adventure hooks in a setting is fine - provided they’re clearly labeled and separate from “this is how the world is”. But when you start presenting the world as a series of “when the players do this, then X happens. . .” style prompts, it stops being a campaign &lt;em&gt;setting&lt;/em&gt; and starts turning into just a &lt;em&gt;campaign&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IM3QMKq6tFI/VX-vGzLKLwI/AAAAAAAAEnM/W32d9k3YVec/s1600/birthrightcsboxset.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IM3QMKq6tFI/VX-vGzLKLwI/AAAAAAAAEnM/W32d9k3YVec/s320/birthrightcsboxset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-Specialization of Rules&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is another balancing act with elements you definitely do want. You just don’t want to effectively write a new game tied to your setting that shares certain basic similarities with D&amp;amp;D. I mean, unless writing a new game is what you want to do. But if you want to take advantage of the learnings from this series to write a &lt;em&gt;setting&lt;/em&gt;, then only keep those new/changed rules that do the most to advance your desired aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion--http2bpblogspotcom-wlzjqkrm_9uvx-v6jko6uiaaaaaaaaenczgfxyk7odzus320entry1jpghttp2bpblogspotcom-wlzjqkrm_9uvx-v6jko6uiaaaaaaaaenczgfxyk7odzus1600entry1jpg&#34;&gt;Conclusion  &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wlZJQKRm_9U/VX-v6JKO6uI/AAAAAAAAEnc/ZGFXyk7ODZU/s1600/entry1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wlZJQKRm_9U/VX-v6JKO6uI/AAAAAAAAEnc/ZGFXyk7ODZU/s320/entry1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a campaign setting that anyone actually wants to read, much less run a game in, is a pretty tall order. The kinds of people who might even be interested in an OSR campaign setting are also very often the kinds of people who would rather make up their own world. To make it worse, setting ideas tend to be less portable than new mechanics: I can tack Gus’s exhaustion rules onto Small But Vicious Dog much more easily than I can figure out how to incorporate the Passenger Class or the Ship Spirits into Warhammer’s Old World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think there’s a place for it. In the last three years that I’ve closely followed OSR stuff, I’ve seen a hell of a lot of discussion and innovation around rules. I’ve also seen a hell of a lot of creativity around settings, but it’s been in a less shareable way than the rules stuff. That’s really what this series is about: how can we figure out a way to share the messy, “fluffy” side of our creativity as easily and successfully as we’ve shared rules and adventures and tools. If this has been at all helpful to you, I can’t wait to see what you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction--due-to-my-own-proclivities-when-it-comes-to-more-recent-settings-im-going-to-narrow-what-i-focus-on-to-the-osr-and-at-that-only-those-i-know-something-about-i-know-that-i-must-be-missing-some-great-stuff-strange-starshttpwwwrpgnowcomproduct142933strange-starscomes-to-mind-so-if-anybody-knows-about-other-osr-campaign-settings-or-even-high-quality-non-osr-stuff-id-love-to-hear-about-it&#34;&gt;Introduction  Due to my own proclivities, when it comes to more recent settings, I’m going to narrow what I focus on to the OSR, and at that, only those I know something about. I know that I must be missing some great stuff (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/142933/Strange-Stars&#34;&gt;Strange Stars&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind). So, if anybody knows about other OSR campaign settings or even high quality non-OSR stuff, I’d love to hear about it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, let’s take a look at some good OSR stuff that’s out there and see what they have of the good, bad, and mixed characteristics we identified for the 2E settings, and try to determine if those characteristics are important to new(er) OSR settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;published-settings--there-arent-that-many-published-osr-campaign-settings-at-least-that-i-know-about-several-products-hint-at-their-own-worlds-like-dwimmermount-or-fire-on-the-velvet-horizon-but-in-those-the-focus-tends-to-be-somewhere-else-and-the-world-that-holds-it-is-more-of-an-added-bonus-that-being-said-there-are-a-few-i-want-to-look-at&#34;&gt;Published Settings  There aren’t that many published OSR campaign settings, at least that I know about. Several products hint at their own worlds (like Dwimmermount or Fire on the Velvet Horizon), but in those, the focus tends to be somewhere else, and the world that holds it is more of an added bonus. That being said, there are a few I want to look at.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--h4G0rH_kgk/VX-QgJzTsUI/AAAAAAAAEfc/4Junoc-3cGg/s1600/yoonsuin-670x274.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--h4G0rH_kgk/VX-QgJzTsUI/AAAAAAAAEfc/4Junoc-3cGg/s320/yoonsuin-670x274.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lulu.com/shop/david-mcgrogan/yoon-suin/paperback/product-22070778.html&#34;&gt;Yoon-Suin&lt;/a&gt; is the long awaited work from &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110740771198261840982&#34;&gt;+David McGrogan&lt;/a&gt;  at &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Monsters and Manuals&lt;/a&gt;. It hits pretty much all of the positives we outlined for a setting above: it has a super strong theme/genuinely distinct setting, very high quality art and a strong visual identity, and it provides some setting-specific rules without being so changed as to be its own whole new game. The only thing I’m not sure it has is Play About Different Things - I haven’t looked into the final product in enough depth to know how much it changes the basic experience of play, but from what I remember in the blog posts about its creation, play was meant to allow for traditional dungeon exploration, wilderness exploration, as well as city based intrigue. It definitely avoids being “frozen” by presenting random tables rather than “one true answers” about the setting, and it definitely avoids moralizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Padding? I don’t think so, but it certainly is big. From what I’ve skimmed/remember from the blog, it’s all got a rather good cool-stuff to number of words ratio. It’s just that there’s a hell of a lot of cool stuff, so there’s a ton of words. I don’t think anyone else seriously jammed on it with David, it doesn’t work within the 2E constraints (and very few D&amp;amp;D constraints), and while it provides some rough and ready NPCs and events, it avoids highly detailed ones (Again, I think so. I might be missing something new to the final book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uRtIxCshYak/VMf4JBL3jRI/AAAAAAAADOQ/Edt3BNputh4/s1600/voivodja.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uRtIxCshYak/VMf4JBL3jRI/AAAAAAAADOQ/Edt3BNputh4/s320/voivodja.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vornheim/Red &amp;amp; Pleasant Land&lt;/strong&gt;: So maybe these should properly be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91110/Vornheim-The-Complete-City-Kit&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; separate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=190&#34;&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt;, since Red &amp;amp; Pleasant Land is only sort of technically the same world as Vornheim, and both products aim at pretty different feels and game support. That being said, &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110352289066114829231&#34;&gt;+Zak Smith&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s philosophy is loud and clear through both of them, so I think treating them together makes a fair amount of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being produced by a professional artist, obviously both of these have high quality art and strong art direction. Padding is pretty much Zak’s arch nemesis, so not much of that to be found. Play and concept are both pretty genuinely different from regular D&amp;amp;D, and the theme is pretty strong, especially in R&amp;amp;PL. Most of the mechanical distinction in Vornheim is DM-facing, but I think it helps to create a pretty different play experience. R&amp;amp;PL definitely has mechanical stuff to make it play differently from regular D&amp;amp;D and reinforce its theme. Both products have NPCs, places, and events provided in a level of detail that’s useful for play, and both definitely don’t moralize. I’m not sure how much the standard constraints of D&amp;amp;D affected either, but R&amp;amp;PL had it’s share of design constraints (making everything Alice In Wonderland flavored, for example). Other than playing with his group, I don’t know if Zak did much “jamming” on this one, but the general zeitgeist of blogging feedback and G+ interaction probably fed his creative processes to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the only possibly sad thing here is that neither of these have the expansive, immersive feel of a bigger setting. As negative as all that padding was, it may have contributed to the old settings feeling big, like a whole world. Neither Vornheim nor R&amp;amp;PL quite do that for me, even though both promise plenty of play, and I know from Zak’s blog that there’s a lot of world out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUU0kgAavSo/VX-RHSCeZsI/AAAAAAAAEfk/ho_XgODaoSM/s1600/index.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUU0kgAavSo/VX-RHSCeZsI/AAAAAAAAEfk/ho_XgODaoSM/s1600/index.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qelong&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/117257/Qelong&#34;&gt;Qelong&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/116467250574174824468&#34;&gt;+Kenneth Hite&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting one in that it is explicitly packaged not as a setting, but as an adventure. It just happens to come with a lot of juicy setting elements. It has an extremely strong theme and feels very different from standard D&amp;amp;D, especially when you bring in the mechanical reinforcement of the magic poisoning. The art direction is strong, with a single artist providing consistency, lots of pictures, and all of them high quality. Play is theoretically a standard treasure-motivated wilderness exploration, but the strength of the setting and theme makes it come across rather differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just about zero padding, and I’ve long admired Qelong for its remarkable efficiency in terms of presenting usable, interesting content with a minimum of material. I haven’t seen any evidence of either the good or bad of working with other creative types and get the impression it was the Kenneth Hite show. No especial “wider world” constraints to work within, but the strong theme and small geographical area seem to have provided the needed constraints to spur some great creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NPCs and events are all geared towards how they can create interest in play, which is good, but they’re on a specific timeline, which makes sense for the adventure, but perhaps provides less scope for the players to have free rein in deciding where the setting will go. Much like Zak’s material above, the ultra-compact nature of the book and hyper-focus on the usable, interesting adventure that is the main point of the book makes the setting less open/expansive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blog-settings--theres-a-ton-of-osr-blogs-out-there-and-almost-every-one-of-them-has-a-home-setting-of-its-own-so-ill-be-forced-to-stick-to-the-settings-that-i-know-and-love-from-my-own-blog-reading-im-absolutely-positive-im-skipping-over-some-great-ones-hill-cantons-is-one-i-only-know-the-barest-bits-about-but-i-hear-great-things&#34;&gt;Blog Settings  There’s a ton of OSR blogs out there, and almost every one of them has a home setting of its own. So, I’ll be forced to stick to the settings that I know and love from my own blog reading. I’m absolutely positive I’m skipping  over some great ones (Hill Cantons is one I only know the barest bits about, but I hear great things).&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KqucuhOWJ7M/VX-RmBrbUXI/AAAAAAAAEfs/-52B4Hd_Fdg/s1600/Fetid%2BPit%2B004.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KqucuhOWJ7M/VX-RmBrbUXI/AAAAAAAAEfs/-52B4Hd_Fdg/s320/Fetid%2BPit%2B004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HMS Apollyon&lt;/strong&gt;: This one by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/113442337943907897939&#34;&gt;+Gus L&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/search/label/HMS%20Apollyon&#34;&gt;over at Dungeon of Signs&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite OSR Blog campaign settings. It’s got a super strong theme, lots of mechanical differentiation, and strong art direction (Gus himself producing all of the art associated with it that isn’t a pull from online somewhere). The play is pretty standard D&amp;amp;D megadungeon exploration, albeit in a cool version of a megadungeon with its own quirks. One thing we get less of as readers is detailed background events and NPCs - we get glimpses of some of these in play reports, but I don’t think I’ve seen much of that stuff presented as play aids the way Gus has released player material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ovEYs5j72Js/VX-R4Li09pI/AAAAAAAAEf0/FdXm_jr8JZk/s1600/Centerra15.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ovEYs5j72Js/VX-R4Li09pI/AAAAAAAAEf0/FdXm_jr8JZk/s320/Centerra15.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Centerra&lt;/strong&gt;: If &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/107059341533698976884&#34;&gt;+Arnold K.&lt;/a&gt;  weren’t so damn creative and interesting, it’d be tempting to label his &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/search/label/centerra&#34;&gt;Centerra posts&lt;/a&gt; as falling for the sin of padding. I assert that that temptation is wrong, however, because Arnold’s writing is exactly the sort of imagination fuel that grounds a potential GM’s imagination in the world and provides context to be able to improvise on what the players are doing. I think he accomplishes this trick of being voluminous without being tedious by, well, writing non-mundane interesting things. Even when dealing with matters of culture or society, everything is viewed through a lens of how it could interact with player action or create things for players to do. You know that expansiveness I’ve been mentioning recent stuff lacking? Arnold knocks that out of the park. If I had to pick one candidate for “Most Likely to End Up Like a 2E Setting But Better” it would be Centerra - in a gorgeously illustrated hardcover or boxed set. Man that would rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AkviHuu0J10/VX-SNkinyAI/AAAAAAAAEf8/CqvsGouPaAc/s1600/6m1AH.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AkviHuu0J10/VX-SNkinyAI/AAAAAAAAEf8/CqvsGouPaAc/s320/6m1AH.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swordfish Islands&lt;/strong&gt;: Here’s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://swordfishislands.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;setting&lt;/a&gt; that I’m very excited to see the final product of. &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/116357045271154658211&#34;&gt;+Jacob Hurst&lt;/a&gt;  put the blog together specifically to get it ready for publishing. I’d say that the theme is moderately strong (islandy stuff), but the art direction and art are quite good (Jason’s a professional artist), and there’s a lot going on on the islands in the form of NPCs and events and rivalries, but it’s all presented in a way that emphasizes the dynamic nature of the situation and how it will react to characters. Being tightly geographically constrained, the islands lack “expansiveness”, but they have a depth that gives them the feel of something you could sink your teeth into and play a campaign there. This one is also notable for being one of the few examples where I know for sure the author is working with a creative team of friends, and that the project is at least partially the result of “jamming”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0TW1BDls7Hc/VX-SuPXvM4I/AAAAAAAAEgE/8vVA7DRA7Fw/s1600/Weatherpain-shareable.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0TW1BDls7Hc/VX-SuPXvM4I/AAAAAAAAEgE/8vVA7DRA7Fw/s320/Weatherpain-shareable.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Corpathium&lt;/strong&gt;: The rest of &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/100745879253388987656&#34;&gt;+Logan Knight&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s world is pretty vague, but his grand, vile capital of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/tag/corpathium/&#34;&gt;Corpathium&lt;/a&gt; has some of the best fantasy city building I’ve seen. I don’t think I’d say that Corpathium has a particular “theme”, but it sure does have a strong aesthetic. Logan’s voice comes through very clearly, and everything is very vivid, even when presented tersely in a table. What art there is is great, because it’s Logan’s own stuff, but I wish there were more. What play is about is maybe not as focused as some of these other settings, and mechanical differentiation from the player side is cool but a bit haphazard at this point (disparate blog posts on wizards and clerics and weapon rules and what not). There’s loads of people and places and activities to interact with as players, but almost all of them come in the form of hints and pieces presented in tables, rather than anyone or anything presented as really detailed. For all its vividness, Corpathium lacks some breadth or depth as presented to the world, and I get the impression that the depth is meant to be more emergent from using the tables and crawl rules and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z_uyA3mixh0/VX-TLMwVqQI/AAAAAAAAEgM/qFMkh-B-p_M/s1600/Feorin.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z_uyA3mixh0/VX-TLMwVqQI/AAAAAAAAEgM/qFMkh-B-p_M/s320/Feorin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middenmurk&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://middenmurk.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; with astounding art direction (and I’m including here &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/114084765636968777246&#34;&gt;+Tom Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;s remarkable prose as well as his art). Bonus points in the art direction category for having &lt;a href=&#34;http://verminprong.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;an entire inspirational tumblr full of good stuff&lt;/a&gt;. Tom hints at a richness and expansiveness that I’d love to see, but we only get tantalizing snippets. Everything is lovingly detailed and provides a nice counterpoint to the idea that only laconic things can be beautiful in the OSR. I don’t know if I can say much about mechanical differentiation, as we’ve only gotten bits and pieces of that, but the elf types by level 1 spell rule is a pretty good example. If only there were more of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a1UUFbW8Sjc/VX-Pyr0pPZI/AAAAAAAAEfU/xnCC4Xo3Noo/s1600/88923874-12f8-4b27-a284-57f0267497f7-A26386.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a1UUFbW8Sjc/VX-Pyr0pPZI/AAAAAAAAEfU/xnCC4Xo3Noo/s320/88923874-12f8-4b27-a284-57f0267497f7-A26386.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Straits of Anian&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh man is this &lt;a href=&#34;http://straitsofanian.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; good. &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/113988079199026120948&#34;&gt;+Anthony Picaro&lt;/a&gt;  completely nails “distinct from regular D&amp;amp;D” and “Mechanical Differentiation”. The mechanical differentiation is light-weight but well placed, making maximum impact for minimal changes. There’s not a lot of detailed NPCs or events, but the gods, myths, monsters, and societies presented give lots of opportunity for interacting with the world. I’m not sure the “things you do in play” are that much different from standard D&amp;amp;D, but the fact that the cultures involved are so different might make that moot. Also, other than phenomenal photos of real life inspirational gear and people and artifacts, there is, sadly, no art and no art direction associated with this. Maybe one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Feierland&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://newfeierland.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;A very sketchily presented world&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t know if &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/100096787546719223130&#34;&gt;+Trent B&lt;/a&gt;  has any plans to ever turn this into an official setting for others’ consumption, but I wanted to mention it because I really enjoy it. Mostly it has evocative flavor and subtle but effective mechanical differentiation, but I sure would love to see it with some great art and more developed action hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-06-16-speaking-of-campaign-settings-leon/ -&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110352289066114829231&#34;&gt;+Zak Smith&lt;/a&gt; had the awesome idea to take Noism&amp;rsquo;s brief setting and add to it, then pass it along. So here&amp;rsquo;s a few additions from me in Green Helvetica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  stole &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/a-setting-on-page.html&#34;&gt;this county full of D&amp;amp;Dables&lt;/a&gt; from Noisms. I&amp;rsquo;ve subtracted nothing but have added some bits to it in courier below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like it, I encourage you to now steal it from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and append some more stuff to it in some other font and publish it on your own blog. In a week or two or a few weeks we might have a nicely fleshed-out place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1nhd4QCsfuE/VX_allAeQwI/AAAAAAAAYY4/k5LalYlL4cE/s1600/1024px-Rene%25CC%2581_d%2527Anjou_Livre_des_tournois_France_Provence_XVe_sie%25CC%2580cle_Barthe%25CC%2581lemy_d%2527Eyck.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1nhd4QCsfuE/VX_allAeQwI/AAAAAAAAYY4/k5LalYlL4cE/s400/1024px-Rene%25CC%2581_d%2527Anjou_Livre_des_tournois_France_Provence_XVe_sie%25CC%2580cle_Barthe%25CC%2581lemy_d%2527Eyck.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            Meriadoc&amp;rsquo;s Tomb - burial place of the semi-mythic founder of Brittany, watched over by an order of clerics. The tomb and the clerics&amp;rsquo; weapons are made of an eerily dense metal.(Hex 14)              Conomor&amp;rsquo;s Tomb - burial place of an ancient king, now haunted. It is in a swamp&amp;ndash;the ghosts are not that of the king, but of his many lovers and victims.   A lich is entombed in a bog nearby.              Tower of Erispoe - once owned by a now extinct noble line, reknowned for the eccentricity. Glass cages are built into the walls, housing exotic reptiles.              Giant&amp;rsquo;s Cave - not apparently inhabited by a giant, but a clan of ogres. The locals suspect they are connected to the merchant Ibn Al-Aziz but they despise the foreigner.(Hex 49)              Oessant - island, uninhabited but excellent shelter for raiders. Contains two hidden objects&amp;ndash;one blessed, one cursed.(West of Hex 31)              Witch&amp;rsquo;s Hovel - home of an enchantress. Her features are ever changing&amp;ndash;her head bloats into a morbid caricature at whatever woman is most powerful in the county at the time. (Hex 27)              Castle of Mauclerc - ruined castle, magic treasure inside?There is, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the belly of one of the creatures (or pigs) inside. The wild pigs migrate to and from the castle by a natural causeway exposed at low tide.(Hex 14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                         &lt;em&gt;Adventure Hooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;·       One of Ibn&amp;rsquo;s ships has gone missing and he&amp;rsquo;s certain it&amp;rsquo;s the wreckers in Plogoff, who have caused him trouble before. (It&amp;rsquo;s actually the ogres of the Giant&amp;rsquo;s Cave, but the wreckers are PC-level troublesome dicks&amp;ndash;and have treasure. Plogoff is on the coast south of Leon)  ·       Juliette de Fevers wants bodyguards to visit the witch with her. They will be alarmed to discover the witch currently wears Juliette&amp;rsquo;s features&amp;ndash;because Juliette is sitting on a terrible secret about the Count.  ·       A band of gnolls are causing trouble around Morlaix.Their leader communes with the bog lich.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                   .  Skeleton warriors around Conomor&amp;rsquo;s Tomb. The bog lich sent them to retrieve an artifact buried with the king which will bring the lich back to life.                          ·  Troops from the neighboring viscounty have pursued bandits into deep forest (Hex 44) and have begun to seize supplies from locals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]  ### Previous Posts  &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2015/06/lets-talk-about-campaign-settings-i.html&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About Campaign Settings I: Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction--i-want-to-start-out-our-trip-by-taking-a-detailed-look-at-the-poster-children-of-published-campaign-settings-the-2e-boxed-sets-and-the-worlds-they-detailed&#34;&gt;Introduction  I want to start out our trip by taking a detailed look at the poster children of published campaign settings: the 2E boxed sets, and the worlds they detailed.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice as we go that I do not much talk about Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, or Dragonlance. It’s not that they aren’t lovely settings, and as &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/115126071910531256568&#34;&gt;+Charles Akins&lt;/a&gt;  pointed out to me on Google+, they are far and away the most popular settings in D&amp;amp;D history, what with their novels and game tie ins and representation in later editions and so forth. So why no love from me in this post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a few reasons. First, those three settings are all pretty close to “standard D&amp;amp;D” in terms of what the world is like, what you do there, and what you can expect. Dragonlance veers a bit away from that, but not a ton. Second, they all predate the explosion of purposely made “Campaign Settings” in second edition and all come across as pretty much “let’s take my home campaign world and clean it up for publication.” Third, and here I’m showing my bias, the kind of D&amp;amp;D stuff being put out that I enjoy these days is mostly OSR stuff. OSR types who make that stuff tend to have fond places in their hearts for Spelljammer, Planescape, Dark Sun, et cetera, and usually less enthusiasm for those settings I’m leaving out. I am interested in figuring out the common thread between “tastes of people who make great stuff” and “what was in these campaign settings” so that I can make great stuff. The stuff that is great in those “standard” settings seems to pretty much just be an accumulation of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, what I’m going to do here is highlight what was good, bad, and mixed about these settings, with a bit of explanation and some examples. In the next post, we’ll look at settings I know from the OSR and try to use the same good/bad/mixed characteristics we derive for the 2E settings here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-good--https3bpblogspotcom-63cxgxdxaeqvx-k0cg9g8iaaaaaaaaefar0nl1carviis320brom-03jpghttp3bpblogspotcom-63cxgxdxaeqvx-k0cg9g8iaaaaaaaaefar0nl1carviis1600brom-03jpg&#34;&gt;The Good  &lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-63cxGXDXAEQ/VX-K0cG9G8I/AAAAAAAAEfA/r0nl1CarViI/s1600/brom-03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-63cxGXDXAEQ/VX-K0cG9G8I/AAAAAAAAEfA/r0nl1CarViI/s320/brom-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few things that I think made the 2E settings so imaginatively “grabby”. I had some help from Google+ folks to come up with these, and I’d be happy to hear any more ideas in the comments. Anyhow, here’s the stuff I’ve identified that made the 2E settings work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules Do Not Equal Setting&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110352289066114829231&#34;&gt;+Zak Smith&lt;/a&gt;  made the excellent point that D&amp;amp;D was (and is) the most popular RPG of all time. So the mere fact that you could do something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; while still using the rules you knew and that were super well supported was a big draw. It made the cost of entry pretty low, and it allowed the settings to build on existing imaginary capital - you already know what a halfling is, so when I tell you that &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; halflings are cannibals, that has more resonance than if I just say “short people with hairy feet that want to eat you”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Theme&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110118815125792309582&#34;&gt;+Ramanan S&lt;/a&gt;  pointed out that for the most part, each setting had a strong central theme. Ravenloft = Gothic Horror. Dark Sun = Harsh Desert Survival. Planescape = Abstract Made Physical. Et cetera. This ties into the above point about being able to “do something different”. These settings had strong “elevator pitches” which made GMs and players want to find out more, to do stuff in a world like that. I have to imagine that such strongly stated themes made the work of any writers and designers and artists easier, as it gave them something clear to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Art Direction &amp;amp; Good Art&lt;/strong&gt;: Speaking of which, how about that art, huh? I mean, the Planescape boxed set was just about &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; illustrated by Tony Diterlizzi, and for most of the line, he at least did art direction, if not most of the illustration himself. Dark Sun without Brom would be a very different and less resonant thing. I think a lot of these settings hit a sweet spot between the early days of “whatever art we can afford and that fits” and the more recent “we have one, big cohesive brand to maintain here”. Also, &amp;ldquo;art direction&amp;rdquo; is possibly a misnomer, since the relationship was more collaborative between artists and writers in the best examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genuine Difference from “Standard D&amp;amp;D”&lt;/strong&gt;: These settings gave you stuff that really was different from a pseudo-european pseudo-medieval setting full of orcs and goblins. Sure, a lot of the same stuff got ported around (like orcs and goblins), but most of the settings had &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; different going on. Especially those settings that OSR types hold up these days as “why don’t we have stuff like this anymore?” Planescape, Dark Sun, Ravenloft, even Al-Qadim all give you new kinds of fantasy to get excited about and offer a change of pace to folks feeling jaded with D&amp;amp;D’s traditional flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play About New Things&lt;/strong&gt;: Really this is a continuation of the above point, but I think it warranted breaking out. The point above is more about the theme or flavor being enticing or exotic or just new. This one is the fact that once you make a character in this interesting new world and sit down to play, you actually &lt;em&gt;do different things&lt;/em&gt;. While dungeons were pretty much assumed in every setting, standard dungeoncrawling was not really presented as the default play style in these new settings. Some settings did this better than others, but all of them at least held out the promise that you weren’t just dungeoncrawling with different clothes on and killing different colored orcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanical Differentiation&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is in a bit of tension with the above &lt;strong&gt;Rules Do Not Equal Setting&lt;/strong&gt;, but I think both contributed to settings “working”. It’s also building on the above two points about difference and new things. The base was D&amp;amp;D, so you didn’t need a whole different game, but there were enough mechanically new bits to make it actually interesting and new. New classes, character races, kits, spells, and so forth supported the different approaches you were supposed to take. I’m not saying they always got this one totally right, but it was there, and I think it contributed to the distinctness of the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;: Man I had a ton of fun pouring over the maps that came with the 2E campaign settings, and more than once they led directly to interesting play for my group. There may have been more maps and more detail than was strictly necessary, but they really made the settings feel like “places” in a way that strictly tactical local maps of dungeons and the like don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bad--https2bpblogspotcom-osfes7jqst8vx-lk6lgopiaaaaaaaaefi3lb3h8r4r0is32051xxcoo2fdl_sx258_bo1252c204252c203252c200_jpghttp2bpblogspotcom-osfes7jqst8vx-lk6lgopiaaaaaaaaefi3lb3h8r4r0is160051xxcoo2fdl_sx258_bo1252c204252c203252c200_jpg&#34;&gt;The Bad  &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSfEs7jQST8/VX-LK6LgoPI/AAAAAAAAEfI/3lb3H8r4r0I/s1600/51XxcOO2fdL._SX258_BO1%252C204%252C203%252C200_.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSfEs7jQST8/VX-LK6LgoPI/AAAAAAAAEfI/3lb3H8r4r0I/s320/51XxcOO2fdL._SX258_BO1%252C204%252C203%252C200_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually pleasantly surprised by how few things I could categorize as outright &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; with the settings in question. In fact, I only felt like there were two categories that aren’t at least mixed. Those two categories are &lt;em&gt;preetttty&lt;/em&gt; big deals, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padding&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the elephant in the room when we’re praising these settings. Maybe it was writers paid by the word, maybe it was a misguided attempt to write pseudo-fiction, or maybe a belief that if something is not at least X pages, it’s not a real book. I don’t know. What I do know is that all of that good stuff above is weighed down in just loads of extraneous crapadoodle. Mundane details, over explanation, stuff with little possible relevance to adventures or players, snippets of mediocre fiction, the list goes on. It is perhaps unfair to lay too much retroactive blame for this, but we can certainly do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moralizing&lt;/strong&gt;: After the satanic panic of the 80’s and just the general trend of D&amp;amp;D products more often bought by parents for their kids, 2E ended up with a definite “epic fantasy about good guys versus bad guys” vibe going on. From a &lt;a href=&#34;http://grubbstreet.blogspot.com/2015/03/riding-storm-out.html&#34;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; by Jeff Grubb, I think that having explicit good guys and bad guys was actually a requirement for settings. That post, by the way, is a pitch for a never-made 2E setting, and provides an excellent window on what went on behind the scenes to give us the settings we’re talking about today. Now, don’t get me wrong: moral underpinnings to stories, being the good guys, smiting evil, these are all good fun. I’m not saying I wish all of these settings were nihilistic moral wastezones. It is more that the kind of simplistic, watered down morality pushed by the settings at this time is kind of boring. Perhaps more importantly, as Zak &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2010/01/sandboxes-and-roguish-work-ethic.html&#34;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; long ago, roguish folks can more easily self-direct into adventure, whereas good guys have to be more reactive almost by definition. So overly strong statements of where the evil is and how it should be fought end up robbing the players of agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mixed--https4bpblogspotcom-xmyi6uc8z7avx-kp8zlpgiaaaaaaaaee4chgziyhtiiqs320tsr1053_ravenloft_realm_of_terrorjpghttp4bpblogspotcom-xmyi6uc8z7avx-kp8zlpgiaaaaaaaaee4chgziyhtiiqs1600tsr1053_ravenloft_realm_of_terrorjpg&#34;&gt;The Mixed  &lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XMyi6UC8Z7A/VX-Kp8ZlpgI/AAAAAAAAEe4/chgZiYHtiIQ/s1600/TSR1053_Ravenloft_Realm_of_Terror.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XMyi6UC8Z7A/VX-Kp8ZlpgI/AAAAAAAAEe4/chgZiYHtiIQ/s320/TSR1053_Ravenloft_Realm_of_Terror.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there were a number of things I identified as inherent to the presentation of these settings that really seem like coins with two sides. Elements that had both positive and negative aspects. The good news for us looking back is that for many of them it’s comparatively easy to identify what was good and focus on that without bringing in what was bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamming/Design by Committee&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an interesting topic that came up in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/117775142559140896132/posts/dQMmjTQq8NU&#34;&gt;Google+ discussion&lt;/a&gt; that prompted this post (if you can’t see the post, send me a message on G+ and I’ll add you to my circles). Since these settings were the products of teams of designers, writers, artists, et cetera, we end up seeing both the good and the bad sides of creative collaboration. You get people riffing on each other’s ideas, doubtless creating some stuff that was better than the sum of its parts. But then you also get the decision to pull back from more out-there or funky stuff that might be more creative or imaginatively rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints of Standard 2E&lt;/strong&gt;: On the one hand, working within requirements can produce fun creative constraints, like “Okay, we have to have halflings, but what should they be like? How about cannibals!” On the other hand, do Elves really do much for Al-Qadim? What about having the same kind of spellcasting in a world of Gothic Horror as in a cosmopolitan city at the center of the multiverse? Sometimes the requirement to include the “standard” rules/races/classes made for some odd fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed NPCs/World Events&lt;/strong&gt;: So, having interesting people, events, and places is sort of exactly the reason for a campaign setting. On the other hand, when you have pages and pages on super high level NPCs, plus world events/plots with detailed descriptions of how they will unfold, you start getting into some boring railroady stuff. Looking back to our definition of the bad kind of special snowflake setting, I’d say the NPCs, behind the scenes plotlines, and major world events are bad to the degree that they become &lt;em&gt;frozen&lt;/em&gt; and are no longer malleable to player interaction or will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheer Depth&lt;/strong&gt;: The good part of this one is that there was a lot of material to work with. You could comb through a setting until you found something that grabbed you and build an adventure or even a campaign around that. If you took the time to soak it all in, you had a lot of context for when you needed to improvise things that fit the world. On the other hand, that same amount of depth could easily become minutiae, boring and unuseful facts, and stuff with no bearing on play. It could come to feel like homework to really get to know a setting. That’s when you start getting into the padding from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nostalgia&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay, so sure, some of the appeal for these settings might be that I (and a lot of current OSR folks) “grew up” with them in one sense or another, and we’re looking at these settings through rose colored glasses. So maybe there’s not as much good about them as we think there is. On the other hand, only remembering the gems among the kruft is not a bad thing. I sometimes get the urge to do hyper-concentrated distillations of settings, kind of like I did with &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/p/middenheim.html&#34;&gt;Middenheim&lt;/a&gt;, but then I realize that is time and energy probably better spent on creating my own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-time--in-the-next-post-ill-apply-these-categories-to-some-osr-settings-im-familiar-with-theres-not-nearly-as-many-published-settings-but-theres-a-plethora-of-great-settings-from-osr-blogs-spoiler-alert-they-tend-to-display-the-good-qualities-identified-above-while-avoiding-the-bad&#34;&gt;Next Time  In the next post, I’ll apply these categories to some OSR settings I’m familiar with. There’s not nearly as many published settings, but there’s a plethora of great settings from OSR blogs. Spoiler alert: they tend to display the good qualities identified above while avoiding the bad.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about settings recently. I’m not exactly sure why, but going to NTRPG Con this year brought to a boil something that has been simmering in the back of my head for awhile: what makes a campaign setting good and interesting? Why are &lt;em&gt;Planescape&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Sun&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ravenloft&lt;/em&gt; beloved even by people who don’t run games in these settings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-want-to-do-here--so-i-want-to-take-a-look-at-some-settings-that-have-done-a-good-job-at-grabbing-peoples-attention-and-sticking-in-their-brain-i-think-the-second-edition-explosion-of-campaign-settings-is-a-great-starting-place-because-the-settings-are-widely-regarded-as-one-of-the-best-things-from-the-2e-era-even-from-people-who-wereare-not-fans-of-the-rules-or-criticize-the-direction-it-turned-out-tsr-was-going-i-figure-if-we-do-some-analysis-we-might-be-able-to-arrive-at-some-better-guidelines-for-producing-a-good-setting-than-be-creative-and-only-keep-the-good-stuff&#34;&gt;What I Want to Do Here  So, I want to take a look at some settings that have done a good job at grabbing people’s attention and sticking in their brain. I think the second edition explosion of campaign settings is a great starting place, because the settings are widely regarded as one of the best things from the 2E era, even from people who were/are not fans of the rules or criticize the direction it turned out TSR was going. I figure if we do some analysis, we might be able to arrive at some better guidelines for producing a good setting than “be creative and only keep the good stuff”.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, because I’d like to make up a compelling setting, figure out a great way to present it, and then publish it. I don’t want to make it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to sell it, since there’s not likely to be much passion or originality that way, but I think that it’s an area that could use some exploration. If I’ve got an idea what to shoot for and what to avoid, I figure that will help me do a better job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-to-the-side-the-special-snowflake-problem--https2bpblogspotcom-ecu8shxkdwevx-bhvtzziiaaaaaaaaeeuvvj1noerhrss1600keith-parkinson-ranger-300x243jpghttp2bpblogspotcom-ecu8shxkdwevx-bhvtzziiaaaaaaaaeeuvvj1noerhrss1600keith-parkinson-ranger-300x243jpg&#34;&gt;Setting to the Side the “Special Snowflake” Problem  &lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ecu8shxKDwE/VX-BHvtZZiI/AAAAAAAAEeU/VvJ1noErhRs/s1600/keith-parkinson-ranger-300x243.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ecu8shxKDwE/VX-BHvtZZiI/AAAAAAAAEeU/VvJ1noErhRs/s1600/keith-parkinson-ranger-300x243.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick aside on the “Special Snowflake” issue. I think that Courtney Campbell hits on a lot of the issues that get conflated with having a highly detailed setting in &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2015/01/on-special-snowflake-setting.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Kutalik spoke &lt;a href=&#34;http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2015/01/rehabilitating-special-snowflake-setting.html&#34;&gt;in defense&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2015/01/quick-addendum-to-special-snowflakery.html&#34;&gt;special snowflakes&lt;/a&gt; in a couple of places. So, I wanted to clarify my thinking on some things in order to set aside the antipathy to all detailed settings as “special snowflakes” before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first off, I think that a lot of the charges levied against highly-detailed settings is coming from the point of view of the player. As a player, sure, you might not give a crap about the color of people’s hats or that this village was founded on the site of a great battle 1,000 years ago. But the game master might. The way I see it, campaign settings need to serve two different, but related, purposes: to provide neat things for players to do/interact with, and to fire up the GM’s imagination to make up neat things for players to do/interact with. That 1,000 year old battle might not directly give the players anything, but if it is part of what made that setting stick in the GM’s brain, then it might matter. This isn’t a new argument, of course, I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Zak S.&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://lotfp.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Jim Raggi&lt;/a&gt; talked about adventures needing to be in-play reference as well as things that a GM wants to read and remember, and of course, Patrick Stuart’s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2013/06/art-in-games.html&#34;&gt;observation on art&lt;/a&gt; serving to wedge things in your brain comes up too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point, that I think Courtney nailed especially well in his post above is the way that truly “Special Snowflake” settings, in the negative sense, live up to the name by being &lt;em&gt;frozen&lt;/em&gt;. Whatever the players do, they can’t change them in a meaningful way, or anything they do is in the shadow of some wider metastory or known fiction. Reading his blog post, it finally clicked what irked me about settings with built-in advancing timelines/stories - it was that it made whatever the players did matter less. Anyway, a certain amount of detail can start to feel like you’re laying down unchangeable canon, so it’s a danger to keep in mind, even if you don’t venture into metaplot or “essential” NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-are-we-going-with-this-series--https3bpblogspotcom--rytuj3_kr0vx-b2xfgemiaaaaaaaaeecwnzq-muod_us320tablelands1-maybe-originaljpghttp3bpblogspotcom--rytuj3_kr0vx-b2xfgemiaaaaaaaaeecwnzq-muod_us1600tablelands1-maybe-originaljpg&#34;&gt;Where are We Going with this Series?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--RYTuj3_kr0/VX-B2XfgEMI/AAAAAAAAEec/wnzQ-mUod_U/s1600/tablelands1-maybe-original.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--RYTuj3_kr0/VX-B2XfgEMI/AAAAAAAAEec/wnzQ-mUod_U/s320/tablelands1-maybe-original.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve got some ideas on how I want to talk about campaign settings with the following posts:   &lt;strong&gt;Second Edition Settings Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Looking at the awesome settings of the 2E era and what made them so awesome.   &lt;strong&gt;Applying the results to OSR Settings&lt;/strong&gt;: Looking at cool OSR settings and seeing what they have in common with the good stuff from the 2E settings.   &lt;strong&gt;What can we learn?&lt;/strong&gt; Taking what we identified as good and bad from all of the settings in the previous posts and turning them into recommendations for people creating their own settings (including me).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weapon Characteristics, Ammo, and Bleeding Out for Heresies Without Number</title>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-05-12-weapon-characteristics-ammo-and/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XHSrS-wmA_Q/VVIX9nhY6sI/AAAAAAAAEWk/GnVt4dsFbOA/s1600/24d8961fe8f5bf70712c8ac2b129f47b.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XHSrS-wmA_Q/VVIX9nhY6sI/AAAAAAAAEWk/GnVt4dsFbOA/s320/24d8961fe8f5bf70712c8ac2b129f47b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of posting things as they come up, rather than waiting until something is &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; and taking forever, here&amp;rsquo;s a few  rules that came up at the table last night, plus a few more, for &lt;em&gt;Heresies Without Number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weapon-characteristics--flameflame-weapons-have-the-chance-to-set-targets-on-fire-damage-is-rolled-as-usual-but-if-the-result-is-in-the-upper-half-of-the-damage-die-eg-5-8-on-a-d8-then-the-target-is-set-on-fire-and-continues-to-burn-on-the-attacking-characters-next-initiative-turn-roll-one-die-size-smaller-damage-again-if-damage-is-in-the-upper-half-of-the-die-the-target-continues-to-burn-if-not-the-flames-go-out-after-rolling-d4-damage-the-flame-goes-out-regardless-a-burning-character-can-forego-all-action-for-a-round-to-stop-drop-and-roll-but-may-require-a-willpower-check-to-avoid-running-around-in-a-panic&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Flame:&lt;/strong&gt; Flame weapons have the chance to set targets on fire. Damage is rolled as usual, but if the result is in the upper half of the damage die (e.g. 5-8 on a d8), then the target is set on fire and continues to burn. On the attacking character&amp;rsquo;s next initiative turn, roll one die size smaller damage. Again, if damage is in the upper half of the die, the target continues to burn. If not, the flames go out. After rolling d4 damage, the flame goes out regardless. A burning character can forego all action for a round to stop, drop and roll, but may require a Willpower check to avoid running around in a panic.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blast:&lt;/strong&gt; Blast weapons do not roll to hit as usual. Instead, any potentially affected targets must make a dexterity save (roll equal to or under dexterity, assume Dexterity 10 for characters or creatures without a listed score) or else be hit. The number of potentially affected targets will vary with the type of weapon, but generally 3-4 human sized characters in relatively close proximity may be affected - fewer for smaller weapons, more for larger. (This and autofire owe their existence to Gus L at Dungeon of Signs &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2013/12/simplified-hms-apollyon-or-od-gun-rules.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)   **   Shock:** Shock weapons are designed to stun and subdue more than kill. As such, they do their listed damage (typically d10) against *Guts only*. A target reduced to 0 guts by a shock weapon is knocked unconscious, but is otherwise uninjured. Shock weapons do the damage in parentheses (usually d6) when used as standard weapons, in which case they are able to affect *Blood* and cause injuries as usual. To keep things simple, only one &amp;ldquo;mode&amp;rdquo; can be used at a time - users of shock weapons strike differently to stun versus wound, and using them as crude clubs doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow the shocking machinery to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Power weapons are exceedingly good at piercing armor. Ignore AC from armor when attacking with Power weapons (only count AC bonuses from Dexterity). For monsters where it is unclear where their AC comes from, the referee will just have to make a judgement call. Some creatures (like demons) will be immune to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force:&lt;/strong&gt; Force weapons channel psychic energy into blades of various descriptions. Psychic characters using a force weapon add their Willpower modifier (rather than Strength) to To Hit rolls and damage. Force weapons also ignore the various immunities of demons.   **   Plasma:** Plasma weapons have a chance to overheat and injure their users. Any time a Plasma user rolls an 18 or higher to hit, he takes half normal damage for the weapon.   **   Autofire:*** *Autofire weapons have the option to exhaust all ammo in order to function as a blast weapon for a round. Follow the general guidelines for targeting, but larger magazine weapons will be able to target more characters (an autopistol might be able to hit one or two potential targets, while an assault cannon can probably hit 6 or 7  if they&amp;rsquo;re close enough together). (Again, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2013/12/simplified-hms-apollyon-or-od-gun-rules.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain&lt;/strong&gt;: In the grim darkness of the far future, just about everything has been turned into a chainsaw. Chain weapons grant no special rules in combat, but they are extremely loud and they can be used to cut through most inanimate objects with some effort. Doors, crates, support beams - encourage chain weapon users to think about how their environment could be less put together than it is now. And make sure they attract a lot of attention.   **   **  ### &lt;strong&gt;Ammo&lt;/strong&gt;  Until I decide otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m using the Cascading Dice thing from James at Ten Foot Polemic &lt;a href=&#34;http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-ten-foot-polemic-unified-house-rule.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; . Each weapon has an ammo die. You roll that die whenever you fire it. If it comes up a &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; step down a die size. Once a d4 comes up a &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re out of ammo. Topping off ammo restores it to its default die type. Maybe carrying around loads and loads of ammo gives you a pass on your first &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bleeding-out-and-dying--characters-that-are-bleeding-out-a-result-on-the-injury-table-are-helpless-to-act-each-round-they-must-make-a-toughness-save-a-death-save-after-three-successful-saves-the-character-is-stabilized-and-in-the-clear-after-three-failed-saves-the-character-dies-any-attacks-that-hit-cause-an-automatic-failed-save-first-aid-grants-an-automatic-passed-save-attacks-that-would-obviously-finish-the-character-off-do-so-so-no-that-ork-doesnt-have-to-shoot-you-in-the-head-three-times-when-hes-standing-over-your-unconscious-body&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bleeding Out and Dying&lt;/strong&gt;  Characters that are bleeding out (a result on the injury table) are helpless to act. Each round, they must make a Toughness save (a &amp;ldquo;Death Save&amp;rdquo;). After three successful saves, the character is stabilized and in the clear. After three failed saves, the character dies. Any attacks that hit cause an automatic failed save. First aid grants an automatic passed save. Attacks that would obviously finish the character off do so (so no, that Ork doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to shoot you in the head three times when he&amp;rsquo;s standing over your unconscious body).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-aid--first-aid-in-combat-takes-an-entire-round-and-is-treated-as-an-easy-skill-check-target-6-anyone-can-attempt-it-but-specific-skills-improve-the-roll-as-usual-and-using-emergency-medical-supplies-provides-an-automatic-success-successful-first-aid-grants-a-bleeding-out-character-a-successful-death-save&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Aid&lt;/strong&gt;  First Aid in combat takes an entire round and is treated as an easy skill check (target 6). Anyone can attempt it, but specific skills improve the roll as usual, and using emergency medical supplies provides an automatic success. Successful first aid grants a bleeding out character a successful Death Save.&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Equipment Tables for Stars Without Number, Dark Heresy, and Warband</title>
        <link>/gaming/2015-04-03-equipment-tables-for-stars-without/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-04-03-equipment-tables-for-stars-without/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uUw6xchofEE/VR7s4d8VN2I/AAAAAAAAEMM/-kfCZwecAkM/s1600/379px-BloodAngelsWargear.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uUw6xchofEE/VR7s4d8VN2I/AAAAAAAAEMM/-kfCZwecAkM/s1600/379px-BloodAngelsWargear.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I want to develop for &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/HWN&#34;&gt;Heresies Without Number&lt;/a&gt; is a set of equipment packages by career. So, in other words, if you choose &amp;ldquo;Arbitrator&amp;rdquo; for a career, you get a stack of equipment to go with it that makes sense. These will hopefully be coming soon, but as a step in my process of figuring out what gear to include, I realized I wanted to be able to compare and manipulate my source equipment lists - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition&#34;&gt;Stars Without Number&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/65872/Dark-Heresy-Core-Rulebook&#34;&gt;Dark Heresy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://swordplusone.blogspot.com/2014/04/warband.html&#34;&gt;Warband!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the process of cleaning this text up into a useful table form (all except warband, which copied over as a true table with no work from me, God bless you, Mike Davison) I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share the fruits of my labor in case anybody wants to use it as inputs to something like Logan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/&#34;&gt;Generator Generator&lt;/a&gt; (I may come up with a random equipment table for NPCs later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the table, go nuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15mUOHWBChh_or5aHEwKE1lBocD-h_hUd3_FxhvFLeYw/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Equipment tables for Stars Without Number, Dark Heresy, and Warband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-03-30-emperor-forgive-us/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ57k8grq_Q/VReWYLyKuZI/AAAAAAAAEHg/koeIn53rmSM/s1600/The_Emperor_Revenant.png&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ57k8grq_Q/VReWYLyKuZI/AAAAAAAAEHg/koeIn53rmSM/s1600/The_Emperor_Revenant.png&lt;/a&gt;  ## Introduction  To kick off my &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/HWN&#34;&gt;Heresies Without Number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; game with my home group, I was casting about for an adventure I could run with fairly minimal adaptation. I ended up settling on a D&amp;amp;D adventure that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to run since I got it last year: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=179&#34;&gt;Forgive Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/&#34;&gt;Lamentations of the Flame Princess&lt;/a&gt;*. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I went through, I discovered it took surprisingly little modification to get it ready for 40k, but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up my book for future use as-is, I decided to type up my 40k specific notes. While I was at it, I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Courtney Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/search/label/series%20%28set%20design%29&#34;&gt;set design method&lt;/a&gt; a go. So, what we have in this post is my notes for a remix of the adventure for a sci-fi investigative adventure set in the 40k universe, intended for &lt;em&gt;Dark Heresy&lt;/em&gt; style play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use these notes, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a copy of &lt;em&gt;Forgive Us&lt;/em&gt;, especially the wonderfully detailed maps. Just pretend they have sci-fi details - metal and plasteel instead of wood and stone. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to read the adventure as-is first, as Kelvin&amp;rsquo;s wonderfully conversational style imparts a lot of the flavor of the adventure that the super-terse set design notes do not. Also, the original adventure purposely leaves a few things open for ease of slotting into your own campaign, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and made those decisions here for my own game. So the original adventure might give you some ideas on where to depart. If you do want to use these notes as-is, you could print them out and tape/sticky note them to pages opposite the relevant maps in the original book- that&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to do, assuming they fit (which it looks like they should).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and to make sense of the treasures, which are at the end of the post, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take a look at the rules on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2015/03/factions-reputation-and-acquisition-for.html&#34;&gt;Factions, Reputation, and Acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; I posted a few days ago. The word after the treasure indicates what faction is interested in the item, and the number represents how much reputation can be gained with that faction by giving it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few sets of notes are for the overall setting of the adventure, and some of the factions involved, and roughly correspond to the introductory material on Norwich in the original adventure. Everything after &amp;ldquo;The Complex&amp;rdquo; should map to the adventure directly - some of the names have just been changed to fit my particular milieu.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-03-29-factions-reputation-and-acquisition-for/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5asF4jPMBOk/VRdVH1OpIVI/AAAAAAAAEHQ/jGIivokNeHw/s1600/arbites_and_hive_ganger_warhammer_40k_dark_heresy_by_jubjubjedi-d4fuyby.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5asF4jPMBOk/VRdVH1OpIVI/AAAAAAAAEHQ/jGIivokNeHw/s1600/arbites_and_hive_ganger_warhammer_40k_dark_heresy_by_jubjubjedi-d4fuyby.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these rules provide for running NPC factions and for players obtaining what they need from them. The faction rules are largely based on the Factions system in the main &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition&#34;&gt;Stars Without Number rulebook&lt;/a&gt;, with a hearty injection from Gus L’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2014/07/reputation-and-factions-aboard-hms.html&#34;&gt;HMS Apollyon faction rules&lt;/a&gt;. The faction characteristics range from negative to positive numbers, with zero as average, to work with the acquisition rules, and the faction action and assets rules have been simplified to suit my own GM style. I think they should mesh pretty easily with the more detailed faction actions and assets in the SWN rulebook or elsewhere if that’s what you’re into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquistion rules are a mash-up of stuff from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/65991/Rogue-Trader-Core-Rulebook&#34;&gt;FF’s Rogue Trader&lt;/a&gt; Profit Factor and Acquisition Rules, Gus L’s faction rules, and input from Google+. Thanks especially to Nick Peterson for the “add more dice” idea. For all of this, the original contributions from me are minimal.  **   **    ## Factions and Reputation  The players’ acolytes can interact with a number of groups throughout their missions. If these groups are significant enough that the players may ask them for significant help, or if they will interact with other groups in the sector, then they can be given stats and tracked as factions. Crucially, the acolytes’ patron Inquisitor is tracked as a faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;faction-characteristics&#34;&gt;Faction Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factions have the following characteristics: Force, Cunning, and Wealth.  Characteristics can range from -4 to +4: -4 represents extremely weak or no ability in that area, 0 is about average, and +4  is extremely capable, usually sector-spanning capability, in that regard. For reputation, -4 is an active and extreme hostility to the acolytes, while +4 is fervent, motivated support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force  Force represents a faction’s ability to commit violence and intimidation. A chamber of commerce might have a force of -4, a local powerful gang would have 0, and an Imperial Guard regiment +4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunning  Cunning is how good the faction is at acquiring and retaining secret knowledge, whether through espionage, lorekeeping, or contact with forbidden sources. The warrior elite of a backwater world might have a -4, a planetary governor might have 0, and an inquisitor lord or powerful sorcerer might have +4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth  Wealth shows a factions ability to acquire, manipulate, and use money to achieve its ends. A penitent sect of redemptionists might have -4, a hive-wide merchant guild a 0, and the scion of an ancient and powerful Rogue Trader dynasty might have +4.   **   **    ### Tags  Tags do not have a score like characteristics, and instead are primarily descriptive in nature. They are there to aid the GM in remembering the kinds of things that they will be good and bad at, and what their motivations might be. If a tag is especially relevant to a player “ask” however (see section on acquisition), the number of dice rolled might be modified up or down by one, if that tag makes it especially unlikely or likely, respectively, that the faction can make good on what the acolytes want.  **   **    ### Faction Wants &amp;amp; Provides  While tags will provide the general shape of the sort of things a faction wants to obtain or can provide to the acolytes, the GM may find it useful to record specific things that a faction wants or can provide in order to foster adventure hooks and rivalry with other factions beyond those inherent in their type. For example, while the relationship between and Inquisitor and a Chaos Cult might seem straight forward from their tags, the introduction of things that one can provide that the other wants creates more opportunities for intrigue and conflict.  **   **    ### Reputation  Reputation represents how well a given faction knows and likes the acolytes. It is a collective attribute for the party of acolytes as a whole. It is primarily gained by performing missions on behalf of or turning over useful materials to different factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it would certainly be possible to play a game where each character has his or her own reputation with various factions, the default assumption here is to treat the team of acolytes as a unified whole, so as to place the emphasis on them as a cohesive unit amongst the intrigues of other entities, rather than to encourage inter-player character rivalry or intrigue. If a game with more scope for potential intrigue among the player characters, or even where it is simply deemed more interesting for each character to bring different allies to the table for the team to benefit from, then track reputation for each player character separately. In this case, players should track their reputation with factions, rather than expecting the GM to record each player’s reputation with every faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining Reputation  Some factions will have specific activities or goods that will allow the acolytes to gain reputation with them, but there are also some that are common to almost all factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missions: Completing missions assigned by a faction will result in a specific amount of reputation gain with that faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desired Goods: Turning over physical items to factions that they desire can increase the acolytes’ reputation with that faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical Information: Providing secret or critical information to a faction will increase reputation with that faction. The reputation is gained at the point that the faction believes that the information is genuine (so if the acolytes hand over data files, it might be immediate, but if they just report something, they might not gain the reputation until it has been confirmed by another source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**   **    Limits on Reputation  Some factions will have inherent limits placed on the amount of reputation the acolytes can gain. For example, an alien faction will only trust human acolytes so far, and the Tech Priests will never admit outsiders to their closest confidences. In these cases, reputation will be capped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some factions may require the acolytes to renounce ties to certain other factions in order to advance past a certain point. An initiatory cult may allow anyone to learn a few minor things, but require people to renounce ties to other religions in a demonstrable way before granting more reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allied Factions  It is possible for the acolytes to gain “unearned” reputation with factions that are strongly allied with a faction with which the acolytes have an existing reputation. Obviously, the new faction must know of the association for these benefits to manifest. For example, the players might gain “automatic” reputation with an Imperial Guard regiment that has worked for their patron Inquisitor before, but only if the regimental leadership know that they work for the Inquisitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the “free” reputation should usually be about half of the “earned” reputation with the primary faction, but the GM will decide what is appropriate based on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation &amp;amp; Acquisition  Reputation is used as the target number in Acquisition checks. This is detailed in the Acquisition section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending Reputation  Reputation may be “spent” in lieu of making acquisition checks. Spending reputation covers more serious favors, such as lending direct faction aid to the acolytes in dangerous situations. The most common example is obtaining faction members as allies or troops for a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation can also be spent in lieu of an acquisition roll for more normal asks. This represents the acolytes calling in some favors and burning some bridges to get a greater benefit now at the cost of future assistance. Generally, each spent reputation point should allow for automatically passing an acquisition test at that scale. For example, spending three reputation points would allow for an automatically successful scale 3 acquisition test. This rule can be modified by the GM given particular circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that by combining reputation spent with reputation rewards for completing missions, reputation can effectively be “lent” and paid back at interest. The acolytes could pay the Imperial Navy 3 reputation points for the use of a cruiser and its crew, and then use it in a mission the Navy wants accomplished that would be worth 4 reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction Rolls  When the acolytes enter a new interaction with a faction, reaction rolls should me made just as with NPCs. Reputation modifies reaction rolls with the faction as if reputation were the group’s fellowship (i.e. use the attribute modifiers: - 3 or less = -3, 4-5 = -2, 7-8 = -1, etc).  **   **    ### Player Asks and Acquisitions  Players will often want to use their contacts in factions to obtain help in completing their missions. This may take the form of physical equipment, favors, services, knowledge, or anything else the acolytes may need that a faction might provide. Most small things can be handled through roleplaying or GM judgment, but when the players want something that would entail significant effort, cost, or risk, then it should be treated as an “ask”. Acquisitions are primarily meant to handle “off screen” faction activity, so if the acolytes will be directly and actively involved in making it happen, it should instead be treated as a mission with assistance from the faction, and played out normally.  **   **    The Ask procedure is detailed in the Acquisition section, but is summarized here:  1.  Find and make contact with Faction representative  2.  Roll Faction Reaction  3.  Determine Scale of Ask  4.  Determine modifiers to Ask  5.  Roll against Reputation&lt;/p&gt;

 Acolytes will not normally be required to conduct their missions with their own funds, nor will seeking out loot to enrich themselves be a primary motivator. Instead, their Inquisitor or other interested factions will provide resources and influence based on a combination of their own capability and how willing they are to use it on behalf of the acolytes.  **   **    ### Faction Reputation Ratings and Acquisition  Reputation, covered in the Factions and Reputation section, is the primary tool for the acolytes to obtain goods, services, and help from factions, including their own patron Inquisitor. Reputation serves as the target number in Acquisition Checks, detailed below.  **   **    ### Making an Acquisition Check  Whenever the acolytes need to acquire gear, obtain favors, or get a faction to exert influence on their behalf, they make an acquisition check. The players tell the GM what they want to acquire and from what faction they are asking for it, and they GM will tell them the rarity and difficulty of the ask.  **   **    The basic procedure for an acquisition check is as follows:  1.  Find and make contact with Faction representative  2.  Roll Faction Reaction  3.  Determine Scale of Ask  4.  Determine modifiers to Ask  5.  Roll against Reputation  **   **    1. Find and Make Contact with Faction Representative  In order to ask for something from a faction, the acolytes must be able to contact a representative from that faction. Usually this will not be particularly hard unless the acolytes are isolated or the desired faction is especially hard to track down. As a general rule of thumb, the higher the acolytes’ reputation with the faction, the easier to make contact with the faction it should be.   **   **    2. Roll Faction Reaction  Once the faction is contacted, make a reaction roll as normal for NPCs, but use the acolytes’ reputation rather than any individual acolytes’ Fellowship to modify the roll.   **   **    A reaction of “neutral” or better is required for the faction to even listen to the players’ ask, and the GM should take better reactions into account when determining the modifiers to the acquisition roll.  **   **    The acolytes’ reputation is treated as a character attribute for the purposes of this test, and follows the basic attribute modifier scale:  **   **    &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Reputation&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Mod.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;3 or less&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-3 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;4-5&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;6-8&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;9-12&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;0&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;13-15&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;+1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;16-17&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;+2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;18 or higher&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;+3&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;  **   **    3. Determine Scale of Ask  The scale of the desired acquisition represents its rarity or the degree to which it is “a Big Deal”. With gear, items will have a default rarity listed, though this can be modified based on the faction in question and the situation (Tech Priests on Mars will have much easier access to advanced tech than those on a remote technological dig, while either will probably have easier access than a local king on a Feudal planet). Each level of scale/rarity forces the acquisition check to use an additional D10.  **   **    As a general guideline, use the following tiers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routine, readily available to members of the faction: 1d10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncommon, requires outside contacts or special effort: 2d10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare, requires risks be taken or extreme effort: 3d10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astronomically scarce, requires putting the entire faction at risk: 4d10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**   **    4. Determine Modifiers to Ask  Different factions can more easily obtain different things. The most common resources asked for from factions are covered by their characteristics - Force, Cunning, and Wealth. By default, apply the relevant characteristic a a modifier to the roll. Other situational modifiers may applied by the GM as well, such as a positive modifier to acquire something that will directly aid a mission benefiting the faction, or a negative modifier if the acolytes have been leaning on this faction for a lot of support recently, and such like. Modifiers should usually be capped at no more than +/- 8.  **   **    5. Roll Against Reputation  Finally, the actual acquisition check determines the success or failure of the players’ ask. One player should roll for the group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roll 1d10 per level of scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add or subtract any modifiers from the total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the result is less than or equal to the Acolytes’ reputation with the faction, the acquisition is successful and the faction provides  whatever the players were asking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the result is greater than the party’s reputation, then the faction is unable or unwilling to provide the desired aid. The GM should interpret what this means for future interactions with the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the acquisition roll is fumbled (all 1’s), the players lose a number of reputation equal to the scale of the ask, as they have either offended the faction or something has gone horribly wrong in trying to obtain what they want and the faction blames them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction--i-began-down-this-path-working-on-my-heresies-without-number-kitbash-of-stars-without-numberhttprpgdrivethrustuffcomproduct86467stars-without-number-free-edition-and-dark-heresyhttpswwwfantasyflightgamescomenproductsdark-heresy-i-wanted-a-fairly-simple-but-still-play-affecting-sanity-system-as-well-as-a-way-to-inject-some-40k-flavor-into-characters-from-the-get-go-so-i-turned-to-two-sources-darkest-dungeonhttpwwwdarkestdungeoncom-and-arnold-khttpgoblinpunchblogspotcom&#34;&gt;Introduction  I began down this path working on my &lt;em&gt;Heresies Without Number&lt;/em&gt; kitbash of &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition&#34;&gt;Stars Without Number&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/dark-heresy/&#34;&gt;Dark Heresy&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted a fairly simple but still play-affecting sanity system, as well as a way to inject some 40k flavor into characters from the get go. So I turned to two sources: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.darkestdungeon.com/&#34;&gt;Darkest Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Arnold K.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sanity rules are pretty much a reskin of &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/05/stark-staring-mad.html&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Arnold. I changed the name of &amp;ldquo;insanity points&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;stress points&amp;rdquo; because I like the inclusive nature of covering everything from cosmic horror to extreme or constant mundane stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirks are meant to be a simple way to impart unique character to the acolytes, as well as to differentiate them more than merely their skills and careers. Quirks are gained at character creation, at certain levels, and as the result of breakdowns. They have a rules impact so that players and GMs will remember them and pay attention to them, but their primary goal is to be create a sense of character. They should not be used as an attempt to optimize or game the system - there are much better rules systems for that sort of play than this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a list of Darkest Dungeon quirks from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Quirks&#34;&gt;Darkest Dungeon Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, many of the quirks are Talents from Dark Heresy, and I supplemented with some traits from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mouseguard.net/books/role-playing-game/&#34;&gt;Mouse Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torchbearerrpg.com/&#34;&gt;Torchbearer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some disorders from Dark Heresy and the D20 version of Call of Cthluhu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think quirks and the sanity rules link up reasonably well, and there are some different ways you could use one, the other, or both together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-use-this-blog-post--now-of-course-you-can-do-whatever-the-hell-you-want-with-this-blog-post-but-here-is-what-i-see-as-the-most-likely-ways-to-make-use-of-it&#34;&gt;How to Use This Blog Post  Now, of course, you can do whatever the hell you want with this blog post, but here is what I see as the most likely ways to make use of it:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use as one piece of the more-or-less complete &lt;em&gt;Heresies Without Number&lt;/em&gt; rules I&amp;rsquo;m putting together. This is what I intend to do, and lots of the specific quirk rules refer to rules changes I&amp;rsquo;m using there (like having HP split into &amp;ldquo;blood&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;guts&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use as a reasonably drop-in ready set of sanity rules for any D&amp;amp;D-alike game, or really any game with a &amp;ldquo;Willpower&amp;rdquo; equivalent type stat. If using this, please note that the stress points are scaled to a D20 roll and relevant stats - you might want to multiply everything by 5 if you use a D100 system like BRP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use just Arnold&amp;rsquo;s awesome sanity rules and a more freeform system for the effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use just the quirks for more interesting character creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the names of quirks without the rules as a resource for either positive or negative character traits in combination with some other rules (potions, spells, NPCs, whatever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Generally stress points will be between 1 and 4 for a single event. Characters gain 1 fewer point when they’ve encountered something similar before.  **   **    Stress points may be gained from prolonged or especially extreme exposure to more mundane stressors like hunger, darkness, or danger.  **   **    Testing for Breakdowns  Every time characters gain new stress points, they roll 1d20 + willpower modifier. If the result is is equal to or under their new stress point total, they suffer a breakdown. The nature of the freakout may be determined by existing character quirks, but by default assume catatonia or a weeping fit. If the result is higher, they face no negative consequences beyond being slightly shaken or disturbed, but the points remain.  **   **    Gaining New Negative Quirks  When characters complete their breakdown, they make a willpower test. If successful, they face no further negative consequences, but the stress points remain. If failed, they gain a new negative quirk, which can either be determined randomly, or worked out with the GM to fit the character and the circumstances of the breakdown.  **   **    Recovering Stress Points  Stress points may be recovered by doing normal, human things - like getting drunk, relaxing, enjoying good meals, visiting family, or the like. The effectiveness of different activities should be based on what the character would find cathartic or relieving. One point may be recovered per week.   **   **    Minimum Stress  Half the value of a character’s historic high stress point score becomes their new minimum value - their stress can never drop below this, as they have been permanently damaged by their experience.&lt;/h2&gt;

The default method is to randomly determine all quirks, but at the GM’s discretion they can instead be chosen by the players in order to meet a particular character concept.  **   **    Stress and Breakdowns  After characters suffer a breakdown, they must test their willpower to see if they gain a new negative quirk from their experience. If they fail their willpower test, they either roll a new random negative quirk form the negative quirks in the In Play Quirks list, or agree on a specific negative quirk with the GM that fits the circumstances and character (such as gaining a Fear of Xenoi after a breakdown causing encounter with a Tyranid).  **   **    Levelling Up  Every 3rd level (3rd, 6th, 9th, et cetera) a character may gain a new positive quirk from the In Play Quirks list, either randomly, or based on their actions and character since the last positive quirk was gained. The player in question and the GM should come to a mutually agreeable decision on this if it’s not obvious.   **   **    Duplicate Quirks  If characters gain the same quirk more than once, either increase its severity or re-roll, as makes the most sense in the circumstances.   **   **    Losing Quirks  At the GM’s discretion, certain quirks may be lost, whether intentionally or not, through the course of play. Generally speaking, the system is meant to reflect slow breakdown in the face of unrelenting horror and stress, but if a more heroic campaign is desired or if circumstances are particularly apt, both positive and negative quirks can be overcome and removed from a character. This is left as an exercise in GM judgement, though players can of course make clear which quirks they may wish to explore in depth and potentially overcome.  **   **    Creating New Quirks  The quirks lists, both positive and negative, are far from exhaustive, and players should feel free to suggest new quirks to their GMs to fit the things that have happened to their characters, while GMs should create any quirks that better reflect the particular challenges and triumphs of their campaigns. The perks, flaws, or traits rules of other games, especially those dealing with horror and insanity, should be invaluable sources of inspiration. Quirks would also be an excellent way to define a Xenos player character or NPC.  **   **    Alternate Approaches  If you like the idea of quirks, but not how they are presented, here are some alternate approaches to consider:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the names of quirks, but not rules. Simply treat them as reminders to player and GM about how that character should be played and might react to situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the names of the quirks, but instead of a specific rule for every quirk, simply grant advantage on related rolls for positive quirks, and disadvantage for negative quirks. This will take some interpretation for the less obviously applicable quirks, and in practice might end up more like the first approach above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine positive and negative quirks into one list, and use one or both methods for gaining new quirks to represent differing reactions to stress or ongoing experience in the dark underbelly of the Imperium. For example, combining lists and only gaining quirks from stress might represent a game where some people respond positively to stress rather than negatively, and differently depending on circumstances, while combining lists and only gaining quirks every 3rd level would show that experience is a double edged sword that provides benefits as well as debilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-01-27-red-pleasant-land-layout-review/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lQKgmDnv9Cc/VMf3nLmmBtI/AAAAAAAADN8/cnnMfD2qJ0g/s1600/ROLCoverdisplay-350x350.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lQKgmDnv9Cc/VMf3nLmmBtI/AAAAAAAADN8/cnnMfD2qJ0g/s1600/ROLCoverdisplay-350x350.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%25%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%25%7D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]  ## Introduction  Okay, I figure &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackgate.com/2014/12/09/a-red-pleasant-land/&#34;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=&#34;http://save.vs.totalpartykill.ca/review/a-red-and-pleasant-land-ii/&#34;&gt;insightful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/2014/12/red-and-pleasent-land-review.html&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; than me have already told you what you need to know about the contents of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=190&#34;&gt;Red &amp;amp; Pleasant Land&lt;/a&gt;. The short answer is, it&amp;rsquo;s really good and really pretty. &lt;em&gt;Even&lt;/em&gt; if you have no interest in running the whole setting put forth in the book, it&amp;rsquo;s chock full of mineable goodness. If nothing else, if you are of a staid and vanilla turn of mind like myself, this will help you to push your own boundaries and question your own assumptions about what you can and can&amp;rsquo;t do with a game, which is good exercise for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what I propose to do here instead is to review the layout, graphic design and usability of the book specifically. Yes, I know that implies a lot of moxie given that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiecade.com/2012/award_winners/&#34;&gt;Zak S. has won a &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; award for his previous graphic design work&lt;/a&gt;, and Jez Gordon is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gibletblizzard.blogspot.com.au/p/rpg-books-ive-worked-on.html&#34;&gt;DIY layout hotness with good reason&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that most reviews tend to give the physical appearance/usability one paragraph tops, and then focus on the content. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the right way to go for almost everybody, but I really &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/p/middenheim.html&#34;&gt;like this layout stuff&lt;/a&gt;, and paying attention to it will hopefully help me get better at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lostpages.storenvy.com/products/10964031-into-the-odd-pdf-print-preorder&#34;&gt;my craft&lt;/a&gt;. And hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to some other folks along the way. So let me know if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see more of this sort of thing, and any requests, and I can get on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a bit of a disclaimer - I have not used this book in the heat of play, so some of my suppositions about usability could very well be totally wrong. If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; used something and found the experience different from what I imagine, do please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

First, it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous and sturdy, with a cloth-covered hardcover, which appears to be bound with through the fold sewing (but I could be wrong there - at any rate, it&amp;rsquo;s sewn, not just glued), which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite allow the book to lie flat, but does let you put one facing flat and hold the other side up at about 90 degrees without doing any damage to the spine - it&amp;rsquo;s good and sturdy. I figure if you need a more extreme version for table top use, print out the relevant pages from the PDF. There&amp;rsquo;s also a lovely book ribbon for keeping your place, which has come in quite handy for a read-through. The embossing is attractive, and the cover artwork is Zak&amp;rsquo;s usual quality work, and part of the original &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/09/out-fucking-door.html&#34;&gt;gag&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that led to the production of the book, but I personally think the classy cloth bound cover could have stood alone without it - minor nitpick there, though. Like pretty much every LotFP product, the size is a slightly large digest (A5) which is large enough to read without squinting, and small enough to fit comfortably in the hand or on the crowded gaming table, or to throw in a backpack with other things. Oh, and the paper inside is matte and textured and ivory colored and thick. It looks good and it compliments Zak&amp;rsquo;s art without reducing readability (if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier on your eyes than stark black on white). Overall, the book is nice, it&amp;rsquo;s sturdy, and it&amp;rsquo;s well proportioned for its intended uses.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forematter-general-layout-nerdery-and-organization--so-opening-up-the-book-the-front-end-paper-is-a-map-of-voivodja-and-the-back-endpaper-is-an-illustration-of-a-number-of-denizens-thereof-many-of-whom-youll-recognize-if-youve-watched-i-hit-it-with-my-axehttpwwwescapistmagazinecomvideosviewi-hit-it-with-my-axe-or-read-zaks-play-reportshttpdndwithpornstarsblogspotcomsearchlabelactual20play-they-are-wearing-a-plethora-of-interesting-clothes-and-give-a-good-feel-for-the-sumptuous-slightly-over-the-top-nature-of-adventure-here-the-map-is-very-high-level-but-like-most-of-zaks-maps-it-features-a-lot-of-useful-immediately-gameable-information---distance-names-terrain-and-a-clever-encounter-table-tied-to-terrain-its-placement-is-useful-for-reference-and-it-has-lots-of-whitespace-for-adding-notes-and-new-locations&#34;&gt;Forematter, General Layout Nerdery, and Organization  So, opening up the book, the front end paper is a map of Voivodja, and the back endpaper is an illustration of a number of denizens thereof, many of whom you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize if you&amp;rsquo;ve watched &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/i-hit-it-with-my-axe&#34;&gt;I Hit It With My Axe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; or read Zak&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/search/label/actual%20play&#34;&gt;play reports&lt;/a&gt;. They are wearing a plethora of interesting clothes and give a good feel for the sumptuous, slightly over the top nature of adventure here. The map is very high level, but like most of Zak&amp;rsquo;s maps, it features a lot of useful, immediately gameable information - distance, names, terrain, and a clever encounter table tied to terrain. It&amp;rsquo;s placement is useful for reference and it has lots of whitespace for adding notes and new locations.&lt;/h2&gt;

The book is written by &lt;a href=&#34;http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Zak S.&lt;/a&gt;, most of the art is by him as well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gibletblizzard.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Jez Gordon&lt;/a&gt; did the layout and some of the maps, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lotfp.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;James Raggi&lt;/a&gt; edited and published, with the printer being &lt;a href=&#34;http://otavankirjapaino.fi/?lang=en&#34;&gt;Otava Printers&lt;/a&gt; in Finland. I&amp;rsquo;m going to guess that they&amp;rsquo;re the same printers James has been using for a while now, and I gotta say, the physical quality of all of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten has not disappointed, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad James has them to work with. I was also pleasantly surprised to see my own name in the acknowledgements - I must have commented on one of the contributory Google+ posts, so thanks, Zak.&lt;/h3&gt;

It has three tiers of organization - I&amp;rsquo;ll name them &amp;ldquo;Chapters&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sections&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Topics&amp;rdquo;, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t called anything in the book. Chapters have a roman numeral and are larger and bolder. Sections are bold, and Topics are smaller and plain text. The whole thing is fit on a two page spread with 4 columns each. What this means is that just about every specific thing short of room contents is in the table of contents, making an index unnecessary. The bolding scheme makes it easy to find high level stuff easily, while more time allows you to find specifics, rather than trying to strike an ideal balance between abstraction and detail in choosing what to include in the contents.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;typefaces--now-then-on-to-some-type-nerdery-zak-is-fond-of-denigrating-the-importance-of-typefaces-but-i-like-them-so-i-pay-attention-to-them-the-titles-and-section-headers-appear-to-be-primarily-in-parmapetit-with-assists-from-foglihtenno07-it-might-be-the-other-way-around-which-results-in-a-somewhat-loopy-and-whimsical-look-that-sets-the-alice-in-wonderland-tone-for-the-piece-while-remaining-clear-and-readable-for-quick-reference-the-body-text-is-in-neuton-which-is-apparently-a-slightly-dutch-inspired-serif-that-fits-generally-into-the-roman-category-read-moreherehttpwwwgooglecomfontsspecimenneutonif-youre-the-kind-of-person-who-likes-to-read-about-typeface-characteristics-from-the-point-of-view-of-this-review-its-clear-readable-and-doesnt-get-in-your-face-about-being-a-theme-typeface-it-provides-a-range-of-fonts-for-weights-and-emphasis-italic-bold-extrabold-light-extralight-etc-that-are-put-to-good-use-in-the-text-for-highlighting-important-things-and-distinguishing-sections&#34;&gt;Typefaces  Now then, on to some type nerdery. Zak is fond of denigrating the importance of typefaces, but I like them, so I pay attention to them. The titles and section headers appear to be primarily in Parmapetit with assists from FoglihtenNo07 (it might be the other way around), which results in a somewhat loopy and whimsical look that sets the &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&amp;rdquo; tone for the piece while remaining clear and readable for quick reference. The body text is in Neuton, which is apparently a &amp;ldquo;slightly Dutch inspired serif&amp;rdquo; that fits generally into the &amp;ldquo;Roman&amp;rdquo; category. Read more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Neuton&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who likes to read about typeface characteristics. From the point of view of this review, it&amp;rsquo;s clear, readable, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in your face about being a &amp;ldquo;theme&amp;rdquo; typeface. It provides a range of fonts for weights and emphasis (italic, bold, extrabold, light, extralight, etc) that are put to good use in the text for highlighting important things and distinguishing sections.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;typographylayout--lets-talk-about-the-basic-layout-followed-through-most-of-the-book-margins-are-small-as-youd-expect-from-zak---he-likes-to-get-as-much-content-on-a-page-as-possible-and-the-classical-margins-are-less-relevant-to-a-game-book-that-spends-more-time-on-a-table-than-perched-between-thumb-and-fingers-the-only-gaming-nitpick-here-is-that-theres-not-much-room-for-notes-if-youre-into-that-sort-of-thing-ive-recently-been-breaking-a-lifetime-aversion-to-writing-in-books-so-i-noticed-this-sections-are-titled-with-the-same-titling-font-and-begin-with-a-big-fancy-drop-cap-capital-initial-this-makes-them-easy-to-pick-out-which-is-helpful-topics-are-titled-by-a-simple-large-all-caps-bold-that-is-easy-to-find-without-being-obtrusive&#34;&gt;Typography/Layout  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the basic layout followed through most of the book. Margins are small, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect from Zak - he likes to get as much content on a page as possible, and the &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; margins are less relevant to a game book that spends more time on a table than perched between thumb and fingers. The only gaming nitpick here is that there&amp;rsquo;s not much room for notes if you&amp;rsquo;re into that sort of thing (I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been breaking a lifetime aversion to writing in books, so I noticed this). Sections are titled with the same titling font, and begin with a big, fancy drop cap capital initial. This makes them easy to pick out, which is helpful. Topics are titled by a simple large all caps bold that is easy to find without being obtrusive.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is divided into two ragged right columns per page, and lots of allowance is made for art to break up the blocks of text. More on the art later. The leading looks pretty generous, while the tracking looks just a teeny hair tighter than &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; - but I&amp;rsquo;m eyeballing this and could be totally wrong. The net result is that the text is easy to read &amp;ldquo;like a book&amp;rdquo;, but individual lines are distinct enough to easily pick out when referencing things. This is especially useful for things like stat blocks and lists. More on tables later. The last thing I&amp;rsquo;ll say is that I&amp;rsquo;m not positive why Jez went with ragged right instead of justified for two column text. My guess is that it was some combination of looking better wrapping around art and not wanting it to look too rigid or polished. I may just be enamored of justification since I recently learned how to do it &amp;ldquo;properly&amp;rdquo;. Finally, lots of use is made of bullet points and numbered lists, which works well. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive more into that in some of the specific sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introductory-material--the-alice--as-for-sections-he-first-is-a-half-page-flavor-intro-to-voivodja-the-place-of-unreason-the-red--pleasant-land-followed-by-a-half-page-how-to-use-this-book-this-section-is-appreciated-for-explicitly-acknowledging-and-setting-the-stage-for-its-multi-functional-usefulness-which-basically-breaks-down-into-use-as-is-mine-for-ideas-get-inspired-to-do-something-totally-different-and-kill-pesky-animals-im-sure-there-are-more-not-covered-here-but-those-seem-the-most-relevant&#34;&gt;Introductory Material &amp;amp; The Alice  As for sections, he first is a half-page flavor intro to Voivodja, the Place of Unreason, the &amp;ldquo;Red &amp;amp; Pleasant Land&amp;rdquo;, followed by a half page &amp;ldquo;how to use this book&amp;rdquo;. This section is appreciated for explicitly acknowledging and setting the stage for its multi-functional usefulness, which basically breaks down into &amp;ldquo;use as is&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;mine for ideas&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;get inspired to do something totally different&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;kill pesky animals&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are more not covered here, but those seem the most relevant.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is followed by a fairly brief introduction to the Place of Unreason, (~15 pages) that gives an overview of salient features with a relentless focus on what&amp;rsquo;s useful and necessary for making the game interesting. You&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing a lot of that. It accomplishes a lot by implication and aesthetics - by referencing well known literature, art, and folk lore, western culture fills in a lot of the gaps, with the book going for what&amp;rsquo;s gameable. So, even subject matter is a choice that affects what you can and need to convey in your text or visually to get a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tPIl7GUhp0g/VMf33eIAGHI/AAAAAAAADOE/mRr27u_42QY/s1600/alices.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tPIl7GUhp0g/VMf33eIAGHI/AAAAAAAADOE/mRr27u_42QY/s1600/alices.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this is the Alice character class, which will pretty familiar if you read Zak&amp;rsquo;s blog. For the purposes of this review, I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that it is written to work well with just about any version of D&amp;amp;D or its clones and progeny you may want to use, and the D100 level up table fits admirably onto a 2 page spread, despite some fairly wordy entries. In fact, everything you need is in 2 spreads, which is pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beasts--people--now-the-beasts--people-section-has-some-stuff-that-got-me-really-excited-while-reading-through-it-first-off-this-section-does-about-40-60-of-the-lifting-in-defining-the-setting-i-used-very-scientific-measurements-to-determine-this-most-of-the-descriptions-are-admirably-brief-the-major-npcs-of-the-setting-get-1-2-pages-max-and-the-longest-monster-description-for-guests-or-demons-comes-in-at-55-pages-because-of-extensive-random-tables-to-build-your-own-despite-this-brevity-the-monsters-and-people-all-have-motivations-rivalries-and-hooks&#34;&gt;Beasts &amp;amp; People  Now, the Beasts &amp;amp; People section has some stuff that got me really excited while reading through it. First off, this section does about 40-60% of the lifting in defining the setting (I used very scientific measurements to determine this). Most of the descriptions are admirably brief: the &amp;ldquo;major NPCs&amp;rdquo; of the setting get 1-2 pages max, and the longest monster description for &amp;ldquo;guests&amp;rdquo;, or demons, comes in at 5.5 pages, because of extensive random tables to build your own. Despite this brevity, the monsters and people all have motivations, rivalries, and hooks.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way this is accomplished is through the 4 major factions of the setting - Heart Queen, Red King, Pale King, Colorless Queen. Each creature that belongs to a faction has this really nice icon at the beginning of their entry. The icons are both pretty as well as just the right size to immediately give you the relevant information without crowding the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only three creatures don&amp;rsquo;t have illustrations - horses, a Gryphon, and Pale Pawns - and all three of them have been adequately illustrated elsewhere (Pale Pawns are basically described as vampire dandies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entries are organized alphabetically for reference, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nice note at the beginning about a few general entries to read first if this is your first time (like the rules for Voivodjan vampires in general). Also, most of the rules shared by multiple monsters are repeated in each entry. Repetition in game material meant to be referenced is &lt;em&gt;super useful&lt;/em&gt; but is often cut for seeming unnecessary when the book is viewed as a book you read cover to cover. Generally, I like what terms are bolded in the monster entries - things like spells, specific abilities, and each stat in the stat block (with regular weight numbers). The stat blocks could maybe stand to be a touch more set off, but the fact that practically every monster fits on one page, or at worst, one spread, combined with the relatively straightforward stats makes that a minor issue. Oh, and while the general description for each monster is a paragraph or two of standard prose, almost everything else is bullet points, which is again good for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, really top marks for the monster section - most of what makes the setting interesting and unique is conveyed by, you know, &lt;em&gt;the people and things characters will actually interact with&lt;/em&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s an added bonus that the monsters can be easily ported if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a creative and slightly weird monster to put somewhere else, but a lot of them fit into their factions and ranks in cool ways that makes them all more rich together than alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adventure-locations--if-monsters-do-around-half-of-the-heavy-lifting-for-getting-the-setting-into-your-brain-the-adventure-locations-do-maybe-30-40--you-get-to-see-the-heart-queens-palace-and-the-red-kings-fortress-and-both-are-wacky-and-wonderful-and-will-give-you-very-creative-ideas-for-running-dungeons-implicitly-both-show-you-what-unreason-really-means-and-give-you-a-model-for-the-kind-of-challenges-you-can-throw-at-players-here-so-they-do-a-lot-more-than-just-give-you-cool-places-to-explore-and-most-of-the-weirdness-and-puzzles-are-made-to-be-modular-and-portable-and-are-even-called-out-as-such-in-the-introductory-material-so-thats-cool-for-the-actual-layout-each-location-begins-with-some-general-notes-a-random-encounter-table-d100-natch-and-a-full-location-map-that-fits-on-one-spread&#34;&gt;Adventure Locations  If monsters do around half of the heavy lifting for getting the setting into your brain, the adventure locations do maybe 30-40% . You get to see the Heart Queen&amp;rsquo;s Palace and the Red King&amp;rsquo;s Fortress, and both are wacky and wonderful, and will give you very creative ideas for running &amp;ldquo;dungeons&amp;rdquo;. Implicitly, both show you what &amp;ldquo;Unreason&amp;rdquo; really means, and give you a model for the kind of challenges you can throw at players here, so they do a lot more than just give you cool places to explore. And most of the weirdness and puzzles are made to be modular and portable (and are even called out as such in the introductory material, so that&amp;rsquo;s cool). For the actual layout, each location begins with some general notes, a random encounter table (d100, natch), and a full location map that fits on one spread.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maps--illustrations--like-all-of-zaks-maps-they-pack-a-lotof-information-but-i-find-these-much-more-immediately-comprehensible-than-those-in-vornheimhttpwwwlotfpcomstoreindexphprouteproductproductproduct_id75-which-i-found-confusing-initially-and-awkward-for-my-brain-even-after-i-got-them-the-rpl-maps-still-take-some-study-to-get-familiar-but-once-you-know-the-place-almosteverything-you-need-to-run-the-whole-location-except-some-puzzles-and-set-piece-rooms-is-right-there-which-is-super-cool-all-of-the-rooms-are-labeled-right-there-on-the-map-but-also-have-numbers-for-reference-to-the-keyed-description-side-views-are-incorporated-where-useful-and-necessary-and-are-clearly-marked-the-door-locked-door-and-secret-door-icons-are-nicely-useful-but-i-reallylike-the-notation-used-for-doors-in-the-floor-and-ceiling-theres-a-yellow-square-and-then-an-orange-arrow-leading-to-the-connected-piece-of-the-map-if-its-in-the-ceiling-the-arrow-overlaps-one-side-of-the-yellow-square-frame-it-goes-over-and-up-but-if-it-goes-down-the-frame-overlaps-it-thus-showing-it-going-down-this-is-a-really-neat-visual-way-to-convey-complex-information-clearly-and-easily-nice&#34;&gt;Maps &amp;amp; Illustrations  Like all of Zak&amp;rsquo;s maps, they pack a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of information, but I find these much more immediately comprehensible than those in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=75&#34;&gt;Vornheim&lt;/a&gt;, which I found confusing initially, and awkward for my brain even after I got them. The R&amp;amp;PL maps still take some study to get familiar, but once you know the place, &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything you need to run the whole location except some puzzles and set piece rooms is right there, which is super cool. All of the rooms are labeled right there on the map, but also have numbers for reference to the keyed description. Side views are incorporated where useful and necessary, and are clearly marked. The door, locked door, and secret door icons are nicely useful, but I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like the notation used for doors in the floor and ceiling. There&amp;rsquo;s a yellow square and then an orange arrow leading to the connected piece of the map. If it&amp;rsquo;s in the ceiling, the arrow overlaps one side of the yellow square frame (it goes &amp;ldquo;over&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;up), but if it goes down, the frame overlaps it (thus showing it going &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo;). This is a really neat visual way to convey complex information clearly and easily. Nice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part, though, is again &lt;em&gt;repetition&lt;/em&gt;. Pieces of the maps are repeated throughout the keying, such that you are never more than one page flip away from the map relevant to what you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading (okay there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; page that&amp;rsquo;s two flips away from the relevant map). This is a fantastic solution to the difficulty of getting detailed enough room descriptions into one spread. Everyone, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; writing/laying out dungeons, &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt; do this. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to start incorporating it into my own work. Really useful. Oh, and the illustrations throughout are both evocative and often useful (especially for the weirder rooms with crazy effects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;room-descriptions--now-speaking-of-room-descriptions-these-are-brief-bulleted-and-generally-focus-on-only-what-is-differentinterestingtactically-relevant-for-the-room-with-the-rest-being-covered-by-the-scene-setting-in-the-general-description-and-your-own-understanding-of-what-would-be-in-say-an-opulent-ridiculous-palace-or-an-impenetrable-vampire-fortress-occupants-and-references-to-other-rooms-are-bolded-and-most-of-the-spatial-relationships-not-covered-by-secret-doors-or-weird-passageways-are-left-to-the-map-to-show-its-not-quite-as-systematic-as-courtney-campbells-set-design-methodhttphackslashmasterblogspotcom201206on-set-designhtml-but-i-dont-think-to-take-a-highlighter-to-the-text-to-make-it-playable&#34;&gt;Room Descriptions  Now, speaking of room descriptions, these are brief, bulleted, and generally focus on only what is different/interesting/tactically relevant for the room, with the rest being covered by the scene-setting in the general description and your own understanding of what would be in, say, an opulent ridiculous palace or an impenetrable vampire fortress. Occupants and references to other rooms are bolded, and most of the spatial relationships not covered by secret doors or weird passageways are left to the map to show. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as systematic as Courtney Campbell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2012/06/on-set-design.html&#34;&gt;Set Design method&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think to take a highlighter to the text to make it playable.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to run one of these, I think all I would need would be an initial read through to get the whole thing, some note taking for any changes I wanted to make, and a quick refresher immediately before play. For a location with more variation in aesthetic or a huge number of rooms (like a megadungeon), I could see maybe wanting or needing a more systematic approach to room descriptions, with a clearly defined way of ordering information, bolding, italicizing, et cetera, but this system looks pretty right for these particular dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra-rules-random-tables-and-other-resources--the-remaining-10---20-of-getting-the-setting-across-if-thats-whats-left-i-dont-even-remember-is-done-by-that-general-intro-at-the-top-and-the-sample-locations-and-random-tables-there-are-three-random-locations-showing-the-three-generic-sort-of-territories-in-voivodja---forest-garden-and-interior-they-very-well-may-have-been-generated-by-the-random-tables-following-because-you-see-some-shared-features-between-them-all-three-are-presented-as-a-one-spread-illustrationmap-with-notes-right-there-effectively-giving-you-three-one-page-adventures-you-could-make-a-pretty-great-setting-book-with-nothing-but-these-and-a-thoughtful-monster-section-i-would-like-to-especially-give-a-shout-out-to-the-marble-madness-style-map-of-the-interior-i-think-jez-did-that-one---it-rather-easily-shows-a-super-complicated-place-including-a-section-with-sideways-gravity&#34;&gt;Extra Rules, Random Tables, and Other Resources  The remaining 10 - 20% of getting the setting across (if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s left, I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember) is done by that general intro at the top and the sample locations and random tables. There are three random locations, showing the three generic sort of territories in Voivodja - forest, garden, and interior. They very well may have been generated by the random tables following, because you see some shared features between them. All three are presented as a one-spread illustration/map with notes right there, effectively giving you three one page adventures. You could make a pretty great setting book with nothing but these and a thoughtful monster section. I would like to especially give a shout out to the &amp;ldquo;marble madness&amp;rdquo; style map of the interior (I think Jez did that one) - it rather easily shows a super complicated place, including a section with sideways gravity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a brief section on some widely useful rules - rank, duels, mass combat, skirmishes, and a spell. Not much to say here except that they&amp;rsquo;re clearly presented with the same useful headings and section divisions from the rest of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tables--generators--now-the-tables-what-you-thought-youd-get-a-book-by-zak-that-didnt-feature-random-tables-prominently-there-have-been-tables-throughout-the-book-but-i-thought-id-leave-the-description-of-them-to-this-section-dedicated-to-them-first-many-of-the-tables-from-earlier-in-the-book-presented-either-in-the-introductory-material-monsters-or-some-of-the-locations-are-repeated-here-which-is-great-with-only-one-or-two-left-with-a-see-page-whatever-place-holder&#34;&gt;Tables &amp;amp; Generators  Now, the tables (what, you thought you&amp;rsquo;d get a book by Zak that didn&amp;rsquo;t feature random tables prominently?). There have been tables throughout the book, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d leave the description of them to this section dedicated to them. First, many of the tables from earlier in the book, presented either in the introductory material, monsters, or some of the locations, are repeated here, which is great, with only one or two left with a &amp;ldquo;see page whatever&amp;rdquo; place holder.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of the tables are all useful for Voivodja, many are useful as-is outside of there, and some are useful anywhere with a bit of modification. Some of the plot hook and intrigue generating tables, for example, would make good fodder for copying the text out of your pdf and doing a search &amp;amp; replace (which Zak points out in the text). Most of the tables have a red header with white text, bold black numbers, standard weight entries, and alternating fill rows - page color and a light pinkish/orange sort of color, with strokes on the lines between rows. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142&#34;&gt;Edward Tufte&lt;/a&gt; might have some issues with this &amp;ldquo;chart junk&amp;rdquo;, but I think he has not applied his energies to the different demands of RPG products. Plus they look better than plainly presented tabular with no fills or strokes, and aesthetics are more important to an RPG than to a scientific report. Altogether legible and useful, and none spill outside of a spread, which is definitely useful and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the tables deserve special mention for doing cool things: Encounters, Intercepted Communique, and the Location drop tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;encounters--the-encounters-table-especially-excites-me-as-giving-a-lot-of-useful-information-in-a-compact-form-its-takes-up-both-sides-of-one-spread-but-is-actually-two-slightly-different-tables-each-page-has-a-full-list-of-all-of-the-characters-and-creatures-listed-in-the-book-and-to-the-left-of-each-name-is-a-simplified-version-of-the-faction-symbol-used-in-the-beasts-section---a-little-colored-square-some-with-a-smaller-colored-square-in-the-middle-so-thats-the-first-cool-thing-the-next-is-that-on-one-page-you-have-columns-presenting-the-chance-of-encountering-each-creature-based-on-where-you-are-forest-interior-etc-and-on-the-other-you-have-columns-for-each-faction---so-only-those-creatures-in-a-faction-are-given-a-chance-of-appearing-in-that-column-so-whether-you-need-to-know-what-would-they-find-here-or-what-sort-of-heart-faction-thing-do-they-find-youre-covered-either-one-of-these-alone-with-the-addition-of-the-faction-icons-would-have-been-neat-but-both-together-are-extremely-useful&#34;&gt;Encounters  The Encounters table especially excites me as giving a lot of useful information in a compact form. It&amp;rsquo;s takes up both sides of one spread, but is actually two slightly different tables. Each page has a full list of all of the characters and creatures listed in the book, and to the left of each name is a simplified version of the faction symbol used in the Beasts section - a little colored square, some with a smaller colored square in the middle. So that&amp;rsquo;s the first cool thing. The next is that on one page, you have columns presenting the chance of encountering each creature based on where you are (forest, interior, etc), and on the other, you have columns for each faction - so only those creatures in a faction are given a chance of appearing in that column. So whether you need to know &amp;ldquo;what would they find here?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what sort of Heart faction thing do they find?&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re covered. Either one of these alone with the addition of the faction icons would have been neat, but both together are extremely useful.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intercepted-communique-generator--next-is-the-intercepted-communique-generator-which-is-both-hilarious-and-full-of-potential-for-starting-adventures-it-is-i-think-an-example-of-a-multi-step-complete-creative-result-generator-this-would-work-for-just-about-any-intrigue-focused-game-you-could-want-with-only-a-modicum-of-changes-mostly-to-the-to-and-from-entries&#34;&gt;Intercepted Communique Generator  Next is the Intercepted Communique generator, which is both hilarious and full of potential for starting adventures. It is (I think) an example of a multi-step Complete Creative Result Generator. This would work for just about any intrigue focused game you could want with only a modicum of changes (mostly to the &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; entries).&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say on it layout-wise, though I felt like a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more visual separation between the tables for those rolls taken in sequence without a a header might be helpful for a GM in a hurry. For example, under &amp;ldquo;To. . .&amp;rdquo; (bolded) is a 1d6 table for a salutation, and then a 1d20 table for the recipient. There is a slightly darker line between these, and obviously the numbers change, but in a hurry, you might just roll a d20 and miss out on the salutation. With a little more time (like pre-session prep) this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem, but perhaps a little more space or a mad-lib style sentence with blanks for each roll would have been a helpful visual cue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;location-drop-tables--the-drop-tables-are-not-anything-new-if-youve-seen-vornheim-or-the-many-works-influenced-by-it-i-like-the-concept-of-drop-tables---they-have-a-ton-of-information-built-into-them-and-they-make-use-of-the-spatial-characteristics-of-dice-in-addition-to-their-sides-and-numbers-on-the-other-hand-i-think-youd-need-fairly-small-dice-to-make-use-of-these-tables-and-youd-have-to-be-holding-up-the-half-of-the-book-not-being-used-to-keep-the-other-side-flat-for-the-roll-altogether-possibly-more-useful-blown-up-to-letter-ish-size-printed-out-and-put-into-a-box-top-to-contain-the-dice-like-some-of-the-stuff-dyson-logos-has-been-experimenting-withhttpsrpgcharacterswordpresscom20150101drop-table-1-1-the-mushroom-cavern-wandering-monsters-given-these-reservations-i-really-appreciate-that-the-drop-tables-are-reproduced-as-more-traditional-tables-so-you-can-use-whatever-method-works-for-you&#34;&gt;Location Drop Tables  The drop tables are not anything new if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen Vornheim or the many works influenced by it. I like the concept of drop tables - they have a ton of information built into them and they make use of the spatial characteristics of dice in addition to their sides and numbers. On the other hand, I think you&amp;rsquo;d need fairly small dice to make use of these tables, and you&amp;rsquo;d have to be holding up the half of the book not being used to keep the other side flat for the roll. Altogether, possibly more useful blown up to letter-ish size, printed out, and put into a box top to contain the dice (like some of the stuff Dyson Logos has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/drop-table-1-1-the-mushroom-cavern-wandering-monsters/&#34;&gt;experimenting with&lt;/a&gt;). Given these reservations, I really appreciate that the drop tables are reproduced as more traditional tables, so you can use whatever method works for you.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-art--oh-and-i-promised-id-talk-about-the-art-all-illustrations-are-by-zak-and-they-are-very-definitely-his-style-while-i-find-his-work-technically-impressive-much-of-it-is-not-my-personal-favorite-style-which-probably-says-more-about-me-than-anything-else&#34;&gt;The Art  Oh, and I promised I&amp;rsquo;d talk about the art. All illustrations are by Zak, and they are very definitely his style. While I find his work technically impressive, much of it is not my personal favorite style, which probably says more about me than anything else.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in terms of gameability, the frequent illustrations not only make the book more fun to look at, they go a long way towards&lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2013/06/art-in-games.html&#34;&gt;jamming the setting into your brain&lt;/a&gt;. I probably lied about the division of setting-conveyance above, since I short-changed art. It goes a long way to giving you the aesthetic of the place, which is a huge part of this setting (and maybe any game setting? I&amp;rsquo;m gonna say yes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More prosaically, the art provides an aid to mental bookmarking - you can go &amp;ldquo;oh yeah, the section on that one wing of the Heart Queen&amp;rsquo;s palace has the creepy lionfish thing in it&amp;rdquo;.  And having almost every monster illustrated is fantastic - I tend to like Zak&amp;rsquo;s monster art a lot more than his other stuff, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m biased there, but it makes the weird new creatures a lot more concrete and evocative and saves effort in the written description, which gives you more elbow room for talking about behavior and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quibbles--nitpicks--i-only-had-a-few-quibbles-and-nitpicks-but-they-were-there-and-for-the-sake-of-completeness-here-they-are-there-were-a-few-typos-throughout-the-text-not-a-lot-certainly-fewer-than-most-diyindiewhatever-type-products-but-some-the-rabbit-has-the-pale-kings-icon-but-his-text-says-he-works-for-the-heart-queen-on-the-plus-side-this-could-serve-as-an-inspiration-for-some-intrigue-and-one-of-the-handouts-is-missing-from-the-back-of-my-printed-copy-though-its-present-in-my-pdf-which-is-probably-where-i-would-get-it-from-if-used-anyway-unlike-vornheim-the-chapter-headings-at-the-top-of-the-page-and-the-page-numbers-at-the-bottom-are-somewhat-small-and-the-page-numbers-are-centered-on-the-page-which-certainly-looks-attractive-but-makes-flipping-through-the-book-to-a-specific-page-a-teensybit-less-convenient-than-outside-edge-number&#34;&gt;Quibbles &amp;amp; Nitpicks  I only had a few quibbles and nitpicks, but they were there, and for the sake of completeness, here they are. There were a few typos throughout the text (not a lot, certainly fewer than most DIY/Indie/whatever type products, but some). The Rabbit has the Pale King&amp;rsquo;s icon, but his text says he works for the Heart Queen (on the plus side, this could serve as an inspiration for some intrigue). And one of the handouts is missing from the back of my printed copy (though it&amp;rsquo;s present in my PDF, which is probably where I would get it from if used, anyway). Unlike Vornheim, the chapter headings at the top of the page, and the page numbers at the bottom are somewhat small, and the page numbers are centered on the page, which certainly looks attractive, but makes flipping through the book to a specific page a &lt;em&gt;teensy&lt;/em&gt; bit less convenient than outside edge number.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve got in terms of layout/typography/editing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion--so-as-should-be-no-surprise-to-anyone-this-book-presents-a-lot-to-learn-in-terms-of-design-layout-and-usability-its-maybe-not-as-in-your-face-radical-as-vornheim-but-i-think-that-this-and-qelong-are-now-going-to-serve-as-my-gold-standards-of-how-to-do-a-setting-book-and-im-going-to-try-to-synthesize-them-if-i-ever-put-together-any-kind-of-setting-so-even-if-you-never-want-to-run-a-game-in-voivodja-even-if-a-gorgeous-rpg-book-isnt-something-you-want-for-its-own-sake-and-even-if-you-dont-think-youll-find-anything-you-can-pull-out-and-use-in-your-own-game-consider-getting-this-if-you-want-a-good-model-of-how-to-write-and-set-up-a-setting-book-but-buy-ithttpwwwlotfpcomstoreindexphprouteproductproductproduct_id190-soon-cos-it-has-sold-fast-and-it-might-be-years-before-theres-a-reprint-i-foolishly-thought-a-pdf-would-be-good-enough-for-vornheim-when-i-discovered-it-at-the-tail-end-of-its-print-availability&#34;&gt;Conclusion  So, as should be no surprise to anyone, this book presents a lot to learn in terms of design, layout, and usability. It&amp;rsquo;s maybe not as in-your-face radical as Vornheim, but I think that this and Qelong are now going to serve as my gold standards of &amp;ldquo;how to do a setting book&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to synthesize them if I ever put together any kind of setting. So even if you never want to run a game in Voivodja, even if a gorgeous RPG book isn&amp;rsquo;t something you want for its own sake, and even if you don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ll find anything you can pull out and use in your own game, consider getting this if you want a good model of how to write and set up a setting book. But &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=190&#34;&gt;buy it&lt;/a&gt; soon, cos it has sold fast and it might be years before there&amp;rsquo;s a reprint (I foolishly thought a pdf would be &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; for Vornheim when I discovered it at the tail end of its print availability).&lt;/h2&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2015-01-14-memory-some-world-building-notes/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--q6aXMxAWGI/VLXhzFJ_U6I/AAAAAAAADB0/dDEMCuIA5jY/s1600/es5s-mage-robe.jpg&#34;&gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--q6aXMxAWGI/VLXhzFJ_U6I/AAAAAAAADB0/dDEMCuIA5jY/s1600/es5s-mage-robe.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this may or may not be game-related, though I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to provide a few suggestions, but it&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely game &lt;em&gt;adjacent&lt;/em&gt; if nothing else. I figure smart folks can use interesting stuff in all kinds of ways for games that I can&amp;rsquo;t even think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a long fascination with memory and learning. As part of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve more-or-less idly poked around at methods of improving my performance in both, but other than a few abortive experiments, I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten anywhere spectacular. A while back, though, I had an idea for some world building, and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching it with a (very) little more rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea for the world in question is a post-literate world. Something bad happened that made this society not trust writing anymore - I&amp;rsquo;m thinking something along the lines of the burning of the Library of Alexandria times 1000. External memory is great for how much it allows us to extend and fix our knowledge, but it&amp;rsquo;s fragile - reproducing written knowledge is a long, expensive process, and it&amp;rsquo;s stored on stuff that can burn, disintegrate, or rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this world, an order of monks (maybe wizards? I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided yet) has arisen to safeguard and preserve world knowledge &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; writing. They&amp;rsquo;re like an anti-library. Where libraries are fixed, they wander, where centralized, they&amp;rsquo;re dispersed, where external, they&amp;rsquo;re all about internal. So, naturally, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to look for real world examples of cultures that have preserved and transmitted large amounts of information with pretty good fidelity over time, as well as how individuals have increased their ability to store and recall information individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, here are some highlights from my research, some of which has been generously shared by Google + folks. I think a lot of this stuff could add some real flavor to either magic users or clerics in your games, and heck, you might be able to make use of some of this stuff yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oral-traditions--by-oral-traditions-i-mean-the-larger-cultural-contexts-in-which-stories-law-religion-et-cetera-are-transmitted-as-distinct-from-the-techniques-practiced-by-individuals-clearly-those-members-of-a-culture-tasked-with-retaining-and-transmitting-the-important-stuff-will-make-use-of-various-mnemonic-techniques-and-some-of-those-are-covered-later-as-for-gameability-any-one-of-these-could-make-for-an-interesting-cultural-feature-or-might-inspire-you-to-think-up-even-weirder-ones&#34;&gt;Oral Traditions  By &amp;ldquo;oral traditions&amp;rdquo;, I mean the larger cultural contexts in which stories, law, religion, et cetera are transmitted, as distinct from the techniques practiced by individuals. Clearly those members of a culture tasked with retaining and transmitting the important stuff will make use of various mnemonic techniques, and some of those are covered later. As for gameability, any one of these could make for an interesting cultural feature, or might inspire you to think up even weirder ones.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic Poetry&lt;/strong&gt; - In cultures that haven&amp;rsquo;t written their epics down yet, the way they seem to work is that the tellers know some general story frameworks or themes, and also know specific sequences of actions that go together (like, if you&amp;rsquo;re describing a duel, you start with the hero getting kitted up, then they talk trash, then they throw spears, then they close to fight, for example). The poets flesh out these skeletons with poetic language that fits a specific meter and/or rhyme. The combination of basic framework, rhythm, and sound apparently allows for on-the-fly production of compelling poetry that tells an exciting story. In other words, &lt;em&gt;rhapsodes&lt;/em&gt; and their ilk didn&amp;rsquo;t actually memorize most of their poetry, they memorized a procedure for creating poetry. Pretty rad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballads and Counting Out Rhymes&lt;/strong&gt; - For &amp;ldquo;Counting Out Rhymes&amp;rdquo; think &amp;ldquo;Eenie Meenie Miney Moe&amp;rdquo;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to these sections in the book I&amp;rsquo;m reading yet, but apparently there are certain phonetic qualities that are especially &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo; to memory. These probably vary by language, but also have something to to do with physiology (like what part of the throat/mouth you use to produce the sounds, and in what order). What&amp;rsquo;s really wacky is that even where precise wording isn&amp;rsquo;t remembered, recall of the semantic content is improved by it being heard and recalled as verse. In other words, a balladeer might hear a poem, and then later on think he&amp;rsquo;s telling/singing the &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo; poem, but he actually changes some of the words - while still telling the same basic story and still keeping to the same general poetic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MByn6gEcAEg/VLXi5i8FXlI/AAAAAAAADCE/3l8IxM1tz4I/s1600/w_hula_198_aa_i_ka_hula_waiho_ka_hilahila_i_ka_hale_600x480.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MByn6gEcAEg/VLXi5i8FXlI/AAAAAAAADCE/3l8IxM1tz4I/s1600/w_hula_198_aa_i_ka_hula_waiho_ka_hilahila_i_ka_hale_600x480.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Hula -&lt;/strong&gt; Though originally for religious purposes, it looks like Hula had become primarily an entertainment thing by the time white folks showed up, and they promptly forbade it (presumably because the ladies were topless). I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a ton of research here yet, but specific hand and foot positions were/are associated with different parts of the stories/myths/worship being performed, and I suspect that they performed a similar role to the poetic structures above, by associating movement and rhythm with specific semantic content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kbnqYtpiGGI/VLXjFCGe01I/AAAAAAAADCM/2RiBKrgJFYQ/s1600/Kathak2.jpeg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kbnqYtpiGGI/VLXjFCGe01I/AAAAAAAADCM/2RiBKrgJFYQ/s1600/Kathak2.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathak&lt;/strong&gt; - is a form of Indian dance that means &amp;ldquo;storytell(er/ing)&amp;rdquo; that originated as Vedic temple worship and then was influenced by Persian styles when it became court entertainment to the Mughals. What I found intriguing about it is that like Hula, it has specific hand and foot motions associated with certain representational elements. Also, dancers make use of syllables called &lt;em&gt;bol&lt;/em&gt; that act as memory cues as to what move to do. Finally, like other artists in India, some Kathak dancers make use of &lt;em&gt;Abhinaya&lt;/em&gt;, which is the art of conveying emotions and internal states to the audience, and includes stock body positions, facial expressions, tones of voice and that kind of thing. I have to imagine that being good at that would help to remember the semantic content of a story that involved emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Songlines&lt;/strong&gt; - this one was one of the coolest to me, for being the least familiar. Australian Aboriginal people have a pretty complex (to whitey, anyway) way of looking at the world and its relation to the spiritual. I won&amp;rsquo;t try to summarize, because I don&amp;rsquo;t totally understand it, and if anyone knows better, please correct me on whatever I get wrong. But one aspect is that it&amp;rsquo;s highly spatial - different gods/spirits belong to a place, and the people who live in a place have a special relationship with the stories about those beings - particular people &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; particular stories, and that ownership comes with responsibilities to tell the stories when appropriate and not to mess them up. One specific instance of this spatial-ness coming through is in &lt;em&gt;songlines&lt;/em&gt;. Different tribes of people will have paths across the land - sometimes very long paths - and certain places along that path are associated with different stories, and someone setting out on the path needs to sing the right song at the right place. I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s like the method of loci (see below) in real life, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vedic Chanting&lt;/strong&gt; - Apparently recitations of the Vedas of the Hindu religion are pretty hardcore. A number of complex mnemonic devices that you might call poetic are used to make sure that not only the meanings but also the pronunciations of words are remembered, since the qualities of the sound are believed to be part of the spiritual power in the mantras. Apparently it has resulted in remarkable fidelity, so far as the oldest written records of the Vedas can say. My one question is to what degree this oral tradition is dependent on/symbiotic with the written record. In other oral traditions that lack any writing, there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence of such a thing as &amp;ldquo;an authoritative correct version&amp;rdquo; - what matters is that the semantic content is right and the poetic forms are right, not specific word choice or order. Still, a remarkable example of what individuals and a tradition can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story Bones&lt;/strong&gt; - An acquaintance who wished to remain anonymous told me about a relative of Northwest American Indian descent who conceptualized stories as made up of &amp;ldquo;bones&amp;rdquo;, and then related those to her own bones as a method of following the different connections and associations of different stories. Very cool and totally gameable - maybe &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; bones can be imbued with stories, or each bone could hold a different spell or some such. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropomorphization -&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever read &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt; by Neal Stephenson, this will sound familiar. Basically, people are wired to devote a lot of mental horsepower to other people - thinking about them, figuring out what they want, how to sleep with them, whether they want to kill you, et cetera. Mythology does some cool stuff with this deep and intuitive understanding by embodying abstract concepts as people, and then having those people interact in very human ways. Consider Hephaestus and Athena. Hephaestus was the god of the forge - making stuff out of metal, a kind of technology. Athena was the goddess of generalship, the citystate as a political institution, and &lt;em&gt;techne&lt;/em&gt; (craft, but we got the word &amp;ldquo;technology&amp;rdquo; from it for a reason). All examples of applied smarts. Well, one day Hephaestus sees the virgin goddess and gets randy, so he starts chasing her. After keeping away for awhile, he catches Athena, but since he is continuously cuckolded by his wife Aphrodite, he gets prematurely excited, and he blows his load all over Athena&amp;rsquo;s thigh (I know, yuck). Well, she goes &amp;ldquo;gross&amp;rdquo; and wipes it off with a rag and throws it in the dirt outside of what is to be Athens. Being god-semen, it impregnates even the dirt, and a weird snaky baby named Erichthonius is born. Among other things, as the first king of Athens, he invents coined money. What&amp;rsquo;s the point? When you put together the god of making stuff with metal and the goddess of how to run a society by law and applied smarts &lt;em&gt;you get money&lt;/em&gt;. This very sophisticated conclusion involving pretty abstract concepts is conveyed with remarkable clarity and nuance in the form of a concrete, even crude, story about (super) people acting badly. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spokenaural-methods--song--if-youve-ever-had-a-jingle-stuck-in-your-head-then-you-know-the-power-of-song-to-cement-words-into-memory-its-not-entirely-clear-why-this-is-but-research-seems-to-indicate-that-it-has-something-to-do-with-it-being-multi-modal---you-get-pitch-rhythm-emotive-content-and-semantic-content-all-at-the-same-time-so-you-form-a-rich-web-of-associations-that-your-brain-can-store-easily-songs-are-not-only-easy-for-individuals-to-remember-they-show-remarkable-stability-over-time-as-well-provided-they-continue-to-be-performed-and-enjoyed&#34;&gt;Spoken/Aural Methods  &lt;strong&gt;Song&lt;/strong&gt; - if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a jingle stuck in your head, then you know the power of song to cement words into memory. It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear why this is, but research seems to indicate that it has something to do with it being multi-modal - you get pitch, rhythm, emotive content, and semantic content all at the same time, so you form a rich web of associations that your brain can store easily. Songs are not only easy for individuals to remember, they show remarkable stability over time as well, provided they continue to be performed and enjoyed.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poetry&lt;/strong&gt; - Pretty much all the same reasons that song works except for accompanying music, poetry is apparently a little easier to produce on the fly if you&amp;rsquo;re trained in certain meters and have an arsenal of stock phrases. This makes it fantastically useful for long-form performance art like Epics. For games, I could see this having a cool application to magic: different metrical units modify the spell in different ways (stronger, weaker, bigger, smaller, etc), and the word content determines the actual effect. For added fun, make players &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; compose spells in dactylic hexameter or the like (and don&amp;rsquo;t let them prewrite any!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bol&lt;/strong&gt; - As mentioned under &lt;em&gt;kathak&lt;/em&gt; above, certain Indian performing arts make use of &lt;em&gt;bol&lt;/em&gt;, which are single syllables with specific associations. Drummers use them in conjunction with certain strikes, and dancers use them for different steps. The movement and the spoken syllables reinforce each other, and remembering the rhythm of the spoken syllables helps to remember the proper movements.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s the source of the rhetorical conceit &amp;ldquo;in the first place, in the second place. . .&amp;rdquo; Basically, a practitioner visualizes a location (whether real, like his house, or imagined, like a fabulous palace) as he memorizes something. Each chunk of whatever her&amp;rsquo;s memorizing gets associated with a particular place in his &amp;ldquo;mind palace&amp;rdquo;. When he needs to recall it, he simply imagines walking through the place in the same order. This takes advantage of the fact that human brains are rather good at processing spatial relationships, along with the earlier mentioned multi-modality. This may be the most practical and trainable technique here for use in real life. As a side note, the tradition of &lt;em&gt;songlines&lt;/em&gt; made me realize there&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping you from using this technique in the flesh, rather than your imagination, if you can repetitively travel a particular path. This would be excellent for rituals in a game, or in real life you could consciously associate the things you need to remember in the morning with different places along your route through your place (say, dresser = remember watch and wallet, kitchen door = remember to pack lunch, front door = remember keys and sunglasses, or what have you).&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandala -&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into this one as much, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure to what degree mandalas serve as memory aids rather than being the visual equivalent of the spontaneous production of Epic through combined framework and procedure. In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s not too big a stretch to imagine that following a procedure to lay down colored sand could trigger the associations trying to be recalled, or even to allow them to be interpreted in a different way than purely verbal memory.   **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Pegs&lt;/strong&gt; - This technique is somewhat closely related to the method of loci, in that it involves associating vivid visualization with what is to be remembered. These vary in complexity from the relatively simple to the very complex. The basic idea is that you come up with some set of &amp;lsquo;pegs&amp;rsquo; which are vivid mental images - preferably incorporating other senses too. Stuff that is funny or shocking is more vivid, so that&amp;rsquo;s even better. In the simple case, you just make a set of images, say images of words that rhyme with the numbers one through ten (e.g. gun, shoe, tree, etc), and then you associate a list you want to remember with those images, preferably by visualizing something about what you want to remember interacting with the peg. When you need to recall, you just go through the peg images and they should remind you of the stuff to remember. It works well with lists, but you sometimes have to &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; pegs to get rid of associations you don&amp;rsquo;t need to remember any more (like if you used it for a grocery list, you&amp;rsquo;d have a hard time using the same pegs for a list of people to invite to a party immediately after). A more complicated form involves a matrix. You make pegs for a string of numbers, and another set for a string of letters (you can pick a famous person with that letter starting their name). Then you assign things you want to memorize to a &amp;ldquo;spot&amp;rdquo; in the matrix, say A3. If your peg for A was &amp;ldquo;Adam&amp;rdquo; and your peg for 3 is a bicycle, you would imagine a dude with a fig leaf riding a bicycle, grimacing from the discomfort of the seat on his naked butt (remember, funny/shocking is easier to recall). Whatever you&amp;rsquo;re trying to memorize, you associate with that image, with as many senses as possible. Memory competitors (yes, they exist) use methods like this to memorize whole decks of cards &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fast. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

Considering how closely hands and language are linked (everybody &amp;ldquo;talks with their hands&amp;rdquo;, and hand sign language is the universal method of communication among people who can&amp;rsquo;t use voice, developed independently and organically in multiple places) it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge surprise that you could make the connection go the other way - associate certain words with certain gestures, and performing both reinforces each. A more common example is when kids learn songs (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lurkerablog.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Richard Grenville&lt;/a&gt; mentioned his kids learning &lt;em&gt;The 12 Days of Christmas&lt;/em&gt;) with associated hand gestures or dance moves (hokey pokey, anybody?). The virtues of song and of associating gestures once again reinforce each other. In a game, you could have characters that could navigate via gestures keyed to certain directions or wizards who know more spells, but have to use somatic components for all of them.  **   **    &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In Angika Abhinaya, the hand talks to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;you&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;  **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Stock Expressions and Poses -&lt;/strong&gt; In India, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole tradition about this: it&amp;rsquo;s called Angika Abhinaya and it associates very specific facial expression or body poses with certain emotional or story elements. I figure you see a much less developed version in the kinds of faces parents make when reading scary stories to their kids. Doing the expression helps to encode the semantic content of the story. I imagine a sophisticated version of this could take advantage of the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to remember things when you&amp;rsquo;re in the same emotional state as when it happened. A skilled practitioner could maybe learn to associate the feeling of making a particular face with the emotion that caused it, and then make the face on purpose to remember things that happened in that emotional state.   **   **  &lt;strong&gt;Body Part Association -&lt;/strong&gt; Stuff like the story bones above comes to mind here. Another example is from my own experience. In 9th grade, I had to memorize all the bones in the human body, and I kept getting the radius and ulna (forearm bones) mixed up. So when testing my recall, I started wiggling my thumb for radius and my pinkie for ulna. Now I have trouble telling them apart, unless i wiggle my thumb and pinkie, then I know instantly. That&amp;rsquo;s actually the thing that got me started wanting to investigate kinesthetic memory techniques. Another method that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool is a Korean way to do simple arithmetic with your fingers called Chisanbop. It&amp;rsquo;d take too long to go into it here, but check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisanbop&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; on it to see how it works. When you get good at it, your fingers don&amp;rsquo;t just help you through the calculation in your head, instead you just move them and then you know the answer. It&amp;rsquo;s really wild the first time it works like that.&lt;/h3&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of people doing experiments where they purposely match a flavor or smell to particular information (Matthew Aaron over on G+ said he used candy while studying, and when he got to the relevant part of the test, he popped in the same candy he had when he was studying that part). The only issue with smell is that it can be hard to filter out unwanted smells or to control what smells get associated with what. For example, post offices &lt;em&gt;powerfully&lt;/em&gt; remind me of the Friendly Local Game Store I spent most of my young adolescence in. Not because they&amp;rsquo;re fun or full of games, but because both were full of things made of paper and glue (comics, games, and boxes in one, and letters, envelopes, and boxes in the other). So, without knowing what I was smelling at the time, the smell of paper and glue created a really strong memory and emotional response in me. For a game, maybe a villain could condition the characters to associate a certain subtle smell with fear or anger or compliance, and then release a magically enhanced version when the time is right to strike. &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has the self-described goal of helping  people &amp;ldquo;develop the mental arts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;become real life mentats&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s builds on another O&amp;rsquo;Reilly book called &lt;em&gt;Mind Hacks&lt;/em&gt;, but takes the interesting cognitive quirks revealed there and uses them to focus on practical methods. This has &amp;ldquo;how tos&amp;rdquo; on everything from constructing a memory palace to mindfulness meditation. If you don&amp;rsquo;t find at least one thing immediately useful and relevant to your life, I&amp;rsquo;d be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve now (like a year or two later) finally started reading it, and it&amp;rsquo;s simply delicious to someone with my particular proclivities (Homeric epic? &lt;em&gt;Check&lt;/em&gt;. Memory and Cognitive Psychology? &lt;em&gt;Check&lt;/em&gt;. Cultural concepts and institutions behaving in an evolutionary manner? &lt;em&gt;Check&lt;/em&gt;). My reading is going somewhat slow because I am underlying and taking notes in the margin for future reference, but it&amp;rsquo;s not dense at all for an academic work, and I suspect it will be enormously valuable with respect to the stuff covered in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Strategy  “Strategy” is one of those words that gets used so much that it becomes almost meaningless, especially in the business world. It gets used in completely different contexts and means different things depending (as in Magic: the Gathering versus business school versus Clausewitz). In a past life, though, I was a classicist, so I’m going to go with the literal Greek meaning of “Stuff that a General Does”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does a General do? He coordinates the efforts of disparate units to achieve a higher-level unified goal. Where the lieutenant only sees his platoon, the general sees the entire battlefield. To be successful, he needs the strengths of all of his units, and he needs to put them together just right. Now, chances are, you’re probably not going to be running a huge gaming empire anytime soon (hey, if so, congratulations!) but since you are likely deciding the fate of your own gaming business independently, I felt like some thoughts on how to put together everything we’ve covered in this series might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing  Probably where strategy will be most useful to the hobby entrepreneur is in growing thoughtfully. Lamentations of the Flame Princess has gone from being a label Jim Raggi put on his own adventures into a bona fide game publisher. Goodman Games has gone from a few adventures with an old school feel for official D&amp;amp;D to a complete game line with boxed campaign settings and rabidly enthusiastic fans. These people and others have only been able to do what they’ve done by making sure all the elements we’ve discussed previously worked together, whether they thought of it in the terms we’ve discussed or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Thoughtful About Where You Fit In  So, as we’ve talked about before, this is a niche market (and if you’re talking OSR, a niche of a niche), so it’s extremely important to think about where you fit in. Your success will be limited if you are hard to distinguish, if you bring nothing new to the table, or if you aren’t fulfilling some unmet need in the hobby space. Now, I want to re-emphasize that I’m talking from a business standpoint here.  If making stuff really similar to what other people put out makes you happy, and that’s all you want out of it, go nuts, my friend! But if you want other people to pay you for it, you need to think about what your strengths are, and how you can apply them towards underserved areas of the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from “Hobby Business” to “Business in Hobbies”  These strategic concerns become more important the bigger emphasis you put on the “business” side of things. If I put out my super-vanilla megadungeon with an uninspiring format and completely derivative rules, maybe my friends will buy a copy, but it isn’t likely to make me commercially successful, no matter how carefully I price or track my sales or negotiate my art deals. Which might be fine if all I really want is a nice-looking product and a few dollars for my trouble. But if I want to make enough money that my hobby is self-funding, or to supplement my day job, or even for it to become my day job, I’ll need to think about things a little more rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy Diamond  This brings us to the Strategy Diamond. This is just a model, not a required way of doing things (business school professors loves them some models). You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your strategy, or to help you in your thinking when coming up with a new strategy. Here are the elements and an illustration:  Arenas  This is effectively “What business am I in?”  This is where you can really hone in on where your business fits into the gaming hobby – do you write adventures? Sell game rules/supplements? Make maps? Create art for others? Provide tools to other people to make content? You want to get a clear idea of what you do and for whom here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vehicles  This one is a little less relevant in the one-man shop approach, as it usually involves whether you’re going to internally develop capabilities or acquire other companies or the like. But basically it’s about what business structure you’re going to use to do what you said you’d do in the arenas section. On an individual scale, this might be questions like:  Do you want to go it totally alone? Have a full partner or two? Buy contributors’ work or profit share? Find a publisher or self-publish? Fulfill your own orders?  Differentiation  Given the arena(s) you’re competing in, how will you do better than other people? Higher production value? Lower price? More imaginative content? Notorious online presence? Whatever you choose to do, you want to do it somehow differently from everyone else so that people have a reason to give you business over others doing more or less the same thing. Look back to the marketing section for more on differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staging  This is how fast you act and in what order. Do you start writing a blog for free for a few months, then put out some pay what you want .pdfs, then start publishing physical books? Or do you work quietly on a magnum opus behind the scenes and release it into the wild with a big splash? There’s a variety of right answers, but you want to be thoughtful about it and not just do stuff whenever and in whatever order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Logic  After you’ve defined those four areas, if you’ve made good choices, then a certain apparent logic should just “fall out” of the combination that speaks to why your plan makes sense and will make money. If there is no economic logic behind your combination (“I’m going to compete in the heavy metal scene by hiring a mediocre Beatles cover band, and we’ll book a show just as soon as I can figure out where heavy metal bands play”) then it is a bad strategy. At least it’s a bad business strategy. It might be a good art or community strategy, depending, but it won’t make you money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hk0Nci5IuTo/VI4ra3FzrrI/AAAAAAAACng/E1o1GtyEHsE/s1600/Strategy%2BDiamond.png&#34;&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hk0Nci5IuTo/VI4ra3FzrrI/AAAAAAAACng/E1o1GtyEHsE/s1600/Strategy%2BDiamond.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tying it All Together  Earlier I mentioned the fact that strategy is all about putting together the different pieces you’ve learned, and I wanted to take a moment here at the end to explicitly do that, more so than the strategy diamond above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of These Things Fit Together  So, of the major topics we’ve covered (cash accounting, marketing and pricing, and negotiations) everything informs everything else. Strategy is the art of making sure those interdependencies reinforce and strengthen each other rather than undermine and weaken each other. Carefully tracking your sales information allows you to make better economic decisions about your pricing, your success at building a brand makes negotiations easier, and negotiating well can get you top talent that lets you charge higher prices, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Extended Example of Interdependence  So, you’ve decided that you’re going to publish a campaign setting compatible with any OSR rules set. That’s your arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re going to do the writing on your own, hire a friend at a discount to do layout, and hire one freelance artist to give the whole thing a unified look. That’s your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With professional layout and art, and the fact that you’re familiar with a cultural tradition rarely seen in gaming materials, or at least not done justice, you’re confident you’ll have a stand-out product with really high production values. There’s your differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for staging, you’re going to develop the setting piece by piece on your blog over the course of a year. Since you’ve already got an outline, you’re commissioning the art now to make sure there are no delays there. Over the year you’ll be engaging in Google+ conversations and making connections in the community. Once the year is up and the material is written and art is in, you’ll do a kickstarter with only layout left to do, so you can have the money to professionally publish. There’s your staging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with the outlines of your strategy figured out, you can start thinking about how everything we’ve gone over interacts. You’re going to want to keep track of the money you’re spending on art since you’ve decided to get it before bringing in any money, and you’re going to want to think about how many copies of your setting you’ll likely sell when you think about price and what art and layout costs you can cover. You’ll be able to use that information to set contribution levels in the kickstarter and retail prices after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while you’re setting prices, you also want to think about their interaction with your brand. You’ve chosen to spend this money on high production value, and you want your setting to come off as a professional product, so bargain basement pricing might work against that. Since you’re getting the artwork before the content is finished with lots of lead time, you’re taking a risk. You’ll want to mitigate that risk by taking the time to negotiate with a few different artists to see which one can work on your schedule at a price you can accept, but still does work that matches the professional image you’re shooting for. In order to convince the artists that you’re serious, and to start building your brand in public, you’ll want to make sure your blog is pretty sharp looking, and you’ll want the content you put up to be pretty close to polished, and in your interactions online, you’ll want to emphasize the unique viewpoint you can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these elements working together (tracking your money, building a brand, negotiating good deals that form solid working relationships, and making thoughtful, strategic decisions about how to proceed) you’ve ended up with an economic logic that makes sense – by the time anything goes on sale, you’ll have a built in customer base, a kickstarter will help you better judge final interest, and you’ll be able to make money by charging a reasonably high price for your top quality work. People will be interested in buying it because you’ve picked an underserved area and made something different that plays to your strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion  Even though I’ve put strategy last, so that you can see how the other pieces fit into it, it’s really something that you should be thinking about from the get go. Ideally, any major business related decisions you make should fit into a coherent strategic picture that produces a compelling economic logic. “Strategy” in business is less about outfoxing your competitors (though in big industries that can sometimes be the case) and more about maintaining a clear vision of what you do that is worth money to your customers, and responding to a changing environment by being flexible in order to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I stressed at the beginning, this is ultimately a hobby that we participate in because we love it. If following any of this advice seems cold, or calculating, or in any way sucks the joy out of something you love, then forget that noise. Apply this stuff somewhere else (like your day job) where it won’t have that effect. I personally don’t feel like there’s anything inherently wrong with this business stuff, or combining it with the silly elfgames I love, but you may feel differently, and that’s cool. If you have made it this far, though, I hope that you feel better equipped to turn your gaming content into products and more comfortable letting people compensate you for your cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminology  Leverage – Anything that strengthens your negotiating position or weakens undesirable parts of your counterpart’s position  Best Alternative – The next best option if you do not come to an agreement in a negotiation  Walk Away (Reservation) Point – The very least favorable terms you are willing to accept  Goal – The terms you hope to achieve through negotiation  Distributive vs Integrative Negotiating  Okay, I’ve got some fancy terminology to drop on you, but I thought it was a bit technical to put in the key terminology section: Distributive Negotiation and Integrative Negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, Distributive Negotiation is stereotypical haggling, slicing up the pie, trying-to-get-the-most-for-yourself negotiation that you’ve seen in TV shows and maybe used at the car dealership. It’s not bad, and most negotiations are at least partially distributive. The name comes from the fact that there’s some amount of value (usually expressed in dollars) on the table, and you are negotiating how to distribute it (more for you is usually better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrative Negotiation on the other hand, is about trying to find solutions that create more value than you started with. You’re making the pie bigger. Often there are opportunities for this where the parties involved can make something happen that will benefit all of them more than any one of them could do by themselves. I’m a big fan of recommending you almost always start with an integrative approach to make sure all options for helping everyone involved out have been found, and only then worrying about how to divvy them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors to Consider in Negotiations  Your approach to any given negotiation is going to be colored by a number of factors, and you should consider them before actually starting the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value of this Deal  Obviously, you need to consider how much this particular deal is worth to you. If it’s worth a lot, you should prepare more and consider if it is worth relatively as much to your counterpart. What might be the chance of your life could be routine business to the other guy. Having some idea of how important this deal is to you and to any other parties is one of the most important steps in adequate preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships  Is this deal a one-time thing with a stranger, or is it an ongoing situation with a close friend? You’ll probably prepare and act differently in those situations (as well you should!). Negotiations can be a great way to build relationships, but they can also sour them. If you have, or want to have, an ongoing relationship with your counterparts, it helps to be more conciliatory and to offer more concessions. If you’re never going to see the other person again , and you know that they’re trying to take you for as much as they can (see car salesmen referenced above) then maybe you adopt a harder stance and fight tooth and nail for every concession you can drag out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation  Particular fields of business tend to be small worlds, and that is especially so of the gaming world (especially especially so of the professional gaming world). So, the way you treat people in deals is gonna get around. Maybe you got a book full of top notch artwork for what you knew to be a steal out of a newcomer, but when that gal finds out and starts telling everyone how you hosed her, good luck ever hiring a quality artist again. Likewise, word will get around in a good way if you occasionally make some concessions that are fair and reasonable, but maybe not the best for your bottom line in the short term – “hey, this guy cut me a sweet deal so I could focus on his project more, you should work for him.”  Personal Style  Different people are better at different kinds of negotiations by their nature. Some folks thrive on combative, head-to-head, high stakes distributive negotiations. That stuff gives other folks hives just to think about. It’s good to know different techniques and tactics, and it’s good to develop skills in areas where you’re less comfortable, but for the most part, you’re going to be best in negotiations that play to your style. If you have a really important negotiation that doesn’t fit your style (maybe a publisher is welching on paying you for delivered artwork, but you don’t like confrontation) then do your prep work and have a friend help you. I bet everyone reading this has at least one conciliatory “let’s all work together” friend and at least one “hard-charging, loves confrontation” friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium of Communication  How is this negotiation going to be conducted? In person? Over the phone? Via email? All of these have strengths and weaknesses, but generally, face to face is preferred for all the same reasons gaming in person beats the hell out of a hangouts game. Email or other asynchronous methods allow you to take the time not to get caught up in emotions and to do spot research on specific offers or terms, but it also makes the deal slower and makes it almost impossible to pick up on possibly important cues from body language or tone. With the highly distributed nature of hobby gaming, you’re probably going to have to conduct many of your negotiations remotely, but for any negotiations that are seriously important, consider if it’s feasible to do them in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to Do  Prepare  Preparing before a negotiation is the single most important thing you can do to maximize your chances of success. Many people assume either that there’s too much to prepare for, so it’s best to just wing it, or that they understand their own position well enough that there’s no need to prepare. Preparation isn’t about clarifying your own position (though you should do some of that too) – it’s primarily about learning as much as you can about your counterpart’s position. Ideally, you want to walk into a negotiation knowing exactly what your counterpart wants. You want to understand their position better than they do, so you can figure out how your position can fit with theirs in a way that gets you (or hopefully you both) what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of things to research are basic facts on your counterpart, industry averages for the type of deal you’re discussing, recent activity around the sort of deal you’re discussing, that kind of thing. Anything you’ll be asking for or making an offer based on? Research that really well, so that you have facts to back up your moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Opening Move  There are various pros and cons to being the first person to put something on the table, but a safe place to begin with for just about any negotiation is to get clarification on what you’re there to discuss and what everyone hopes to get out of it. So, you could start a negotiation with a freelance artist with something like “Thanks for meeting me today, I really like your stuff. I’d like to talk to you about how much art you can do for my book and what your rates will be. Is there anything else you want to make sure we cover?”  That gives them an opportunity to add anything they especially care about to the agenda, and might give you more information. If the artist responds “Yeah, that sounds good, but I also want to make sure we hammer out when payment will be made for work” then that tells you that the timing of payment is also important, not just the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you find yourself needing to lay down a number (or a bundle of terms or whatever), a good rule of thumb is this: start as optimistic as you can possibly justify. It doesn’t have to be a rock solid justification, just a good one. If you were in a job interview, and they ask you what you expect salary-wise, you might go “Well, based on my research, people in this field make $80,000 a year plus bonus, so I think that would be fair”. What’s that based off of? Maybe that’s the very top of the starting range of salary for people in that position, or maybe one guy put that amount on Glassdoor.com. The reasons other people got those values may or may not apply to you, but you have a fact-based justification as a starting place to determine whether they do or not, and you don’t cede possible bargaining space before you even start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoot for your Goal  While you’re engaged in the negotiation, you want to always focus on your goal. While doing your research before beginning the negotiation, you should come up with a somewhat audacious “best case” result, and start thinking of that as your target. Research has shown that negotiators with ambitious goals do better than negotiators with moderate or “reasonable” goals. Obviously you don’t want to come up with something totally ridiculous, nor should you get too attached to your goal if you need to be flexible to get to a mutually agreeable deal, but having a well-researched and optimistic goal will give you more confidence and start you from a better position than coming in with a worst-case mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Don’t Forget your Walkaway Point  Speaking of which, your “worst case” is your walkaway point, or as some formal negotiations books will call it, your reservation point. This is the position (be it a dollar value, a bundle of benefits, or whatever) that is the absolute worst you will accept - crucially, though, you will still accept it. So, how do you figure out your walkaway point? You look at your best alternative (some fancy negotiations books go so far as to call it a “Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement” or BATNA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your best alternative is the thing that you fall back on if you can’t come to a mutually agreeable deal with your counterpart in the current negotiation. The simplest example is this: you have a job that is just fine, but someone offers you a new job. Without any other job hunting, your best alternative is probably your current job. If some element of negotiation with the new job offer doesn’t go well - it turns out the people at the new place suck, or the pay is less, or the chance for advancement isn’t what you want, for example - then it’s in your best interest to sit tight at your current job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s super important to keep your walkaway point handy because people get caught up in “deal fever”.  My professor even recommended that you write it down, put it in your pocket, and check it before you finalize a deal. After all, haggling and negotiating can be exciting! And after you put all this time and work into the negotiation, you totally want something to happen, right? Remember that sunk cost fallacy, though? So, if you’ve been wrangling over something and you feel relieved that you and your counterparts finally seem to see eye to eye, before you shake hands or sign anything, pull out that walkaway point that you made in the cold light of rationality and make sure the deal on the table beats it. If not, then you walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Specific Tools and Tactics  Leverage  Leverage is a topic that most people have at least some grasp of, but the key piece that many people forget is that it is anything that strengthens your position as perceived by your counterpart. Say you’re going to your boss asking for a raise. You know that you have a job offer for more money at a new company, but you like the people here and would rather stay if you can. If you never tell your boss that you have an offer for more money, you have no leverage from that job offer. Say you do tell her, but she was planning to fire you anyway – no leverage there either. So while you’re best alternative is often your basis for leverage, your counterpart has to know about it for it to work as leverage, and deciding what to share with your counterpart brings us to our next topic of openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openness  Even though I’m a pretty open guy, and I’m all about sharing information and coming to mutually beneficial deals and all that integrative stuff, I still have problems with not defaulting to “cagey” in negotiations. There’s this natural tendency to think that your secret information is power, and that anything you reveal to your counterpart will give them an advantage over you. Honestly, though, most of the time the opposite is true. Usually, the more you tell your counterpart, the more opportunity he or she will have to find opportunities for mutual benefit and compromise. The one exception to this general rule of openness is your walkaway point – the only time you should reveal that is when you are literally ready to walk away unless your counterpart will budge off of something seemingly intractable.  The reason you don’t want to reveal your walkaway point unless you have to is that as soon as your counterpart knows the bare minimum you’re willing to accept, he or she has very little reason to offer you anything more favorable than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask  Much of the time in life we just accept how things are “supposed to go” and take what is presented to us. Sometimes, though, if you just ask for more, you’d be surprised what you can get. Now, of course, don’t be rude, don’t be ridiculous, but just ask. The worst they can say is no, or “maybe, but what can you give me in return?”. For example, when I go to Chipotle, if I’m not happy with the amount of steak they scoop into my bowl, I go “could I get a little more steak, please?” and sometimes they just give it to me, and other times they go “it’ll be extra for double meat, is that okay?” Either way, I’m no worse off than I was with my stingy scoop of meat. Obviously, this can apply to bigger stuff too, like asking for a higher salary, a bonus, royalties from a final product, or whatever. Practice doing it with the little stuff (like Chipotle) and you’ll feel more comfortable doing it with the big stuff (like your salary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchoring  Anchoring is a technique that all of us have experienced, but most of us don’t ever bother to put a name to. It is quite simply the practice of throwing out a point (usually a dollar value) as the “starting point” from which all other negotiating will happen. The exaggerated haggling of many a dungeon-town merchant is an example: “How much for the rope?” “This is amazing rope – 50 gold” “Bah, it’s rat chewed and made of who knows what, I’ll give you 5 coppers for it”. Both people in that negotiation are trying to establish the bounds within which fine tuning will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more subtle example is in real estate. The list price of a house serves to anchor all offers that will be made on it. Sellers and buyers alike will evaluate how well they did by how much above or below asking price they got. Real estate agents will estimate prices within a range above or below the list price (studies confirm this – groups of realtors asked to provide a “fair price” for a house showed way less variation in values when given the list price than those who didn’t have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be careful! You could fall into a trap here in your zeal to anchor the debate. Say you throw out a number and it secretly delights your counterpart because you grossly under or overvalued something. They’re not going to correct you. Heck, they may still haggle with you to get an even better deal, and leave you feeling pretty proud of your acumen. Research is the best antidote to this - know what the reasonable range is for your negotiation based on the most comparable deals you can find. If someone tries to aggressively anchor you, go back to the stereotypical hawker and counter anchor just as aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log-rolling  Log-rolling is a technique you can use in negotiations that involve multiple issues where you trade concessions quid pro quo. For example: “Okay, sure, I can work weekends, but I’m going to need 5 more vacation days a year” or whatever. Ideally, you want to find the issues that don’t matter that much to you but matter a lot to your counterpart, and trade those for the issues that do matter a lot to you. Say you’re an artist, and you do illustrations for a living. Your counterpart is trying to publish a book on a short schedule and has money to burn to make it happen. Since getting illustrations done on a short schedule is not that big a deal to you, you could offer a shorter deadline in exchange for something that is important to you, like more money, a headline spot as the featured artist, or whatever else is valuable to you and not a big deal for your counterpart to give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packages  When dealing with multiple issue negotiations, it is almost always better to present complete packages than it is to deal with issues one by one. The reason is that each party may place different values on each issue, and if you nail one down, you lose flexibility in reaching accord elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the example from above, where you’re an illustrator working with an author. The author places a high priority on timeliness (he’s promised dates to his adoring fans), but not that high a priority on price (it’s a vanity project and he’s independently wealthy). You place a low priority on timeliness (you’ll be painting for hours every night regardless, it’s just a matter of what topic), and a high priority on pay (this is your job).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you and your counterpart sat down and worked out the timeline first, then pay separately, you both would end up satisfied but not totally happy with the agreement.  But if you instead discuss both issues as a package and say something like “I can give you all the illustrations you need for cheap in a long time, or I can get them to you fast for more money”, there’s a much better chance you’ll both maximize the benefits of the overall deal to each of you. The author can go “I’m happy to pay for faster pictures!” and both of you end up happier than if you had haggled down price and then based how fast you were willing to do it based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few cases where “point by point” can be useful, but that’s really only in very large, complex deals that are very transactional in nature (not building a relationship for later deals) where it becomes more important to make sure each item is adequately addressed than it is to find opportunities for varying preferences to complement one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing Hardball  Honestly this sections is more here to help you identify other people trying to use these techniques against you. It is almost never a good idea to use hardass tactics in negotiations, and pretty much the only time is when your counterpart is already dead set on being a pain in the ass. That being said, lots of people equate playing hardball with being good at negotiating, so you need to be able to recognize the techniques, what’s wrong with them, and know how to counter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Cop, Bad Cop  Pretty much anyone who’s seen a police procedural knows this one. It comes up in group negotations, and one party acts like a friend that understands you, and another acts like the bad guy that questions everything you say and can’t budge on their positions. This tactic is usually pretty transparent, and honestly, the best counter to it is to just call it out, like so: “Really? Are you guys pulling ‘good cop, bad cop’ on me? I was hoping we could all negotiate in good faith about our interests, here.”  A more subtle variation is for the person negotiating with you to say they have to check any real concessions with their superior, and to talk about how much they are on your side and want to make things work. If you find your counterpart constantly seeking approval for any and all concessions, you’re well within your rights to ask to resume negotiations when they clarify their side’s requirements, or to negotiate with someone who has the power to make decisions directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tactical Misinformation”  More commonly known as “lying”. Different people have different views on this in the context of negotiations – some see minor fibs as exactly the same as bluffing in poker, an expected part of the “game”. Others see it as craven deception of the worst sort. You’re going to have to figure out where you come down on this one, but I’d caution against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without even going into the damage getting caught in a lie can cause to your relationships and reputation, there’s the practical side to consider. You might accidentally miss out on an opportunity the truth would have got you. Did you tell that recruiter you won’t be available for months because you thought it would help to get a better offer? Well, maybe if you had been honest and told her that you’re available within 2 weeks, you could have started your dream job, but she’s not looking for someone who can only start months later. I really do think honesty is usually the best policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are definitely times where selective honesty is more useful than full disclosure. Maybe you stress that you’ve done art for hire before but you don’t mention that it was for a friend for crap rates unless they really press you. Or maybe you tell a potential employer that you could accept today if they make a little better offer, and you don’t mention that you have no other pending offers, and the only reason you wouldn’t accept today is because you want to see how much better you can do.  In the long run it pays to be ethical, but it also pays not to be completely naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2014-10-24-how-to-business-aside-call-for-cases/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iBU5fNhlyXI/VEoRTZ-I2ZI/AAAAAAAAB7s/iuq5guFnCiE/s1600/1185675043_4.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iBU5fNhlyXI/VEoRTZ-I2ZI/AAAAAAAAB7s/iuq5guFnCiE/s1600/1185675043_4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to take a pause from the &amp;ldquo;How to Business&amp;rdquo; series to make a request of you, the reader. See, in business school, the primary vehicle of learning is the &amp;ldquo;case&amp;rdquo;. A case is a situation drawn from real life, selected because it is illustrative of certain business concepts, and then written up by fancy professors (usually from Harvard) to highlight the most teachable stuff and downplay the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m far from being able to write a real case, but I think we can all still benefit from some of the methodology. The idea is that theory matters very little in business, and results matter a ton. Also, business issues are complex and rely on the entire context, not just on one or two easily separated elements. So, cases are supposed to be exercise for your business acumen muscles - a way to practice being a manager making crucial decisions with limited information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, they&amp;rsquo;re pretty fun.  It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like a business roleplaying scenario, except with a written &amp;ldquo;Adventure&amp;rdquo; and no referee. In school, the usual format is to write up or otherwise prepare your response to the case before a guided discussion in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am here requesting cases from y&amp;rsquo;all. Have a business issue you want examined? Let me know. Have a specific roleplaying game business episode you want dissected for great learning? Even better. Non-roleplaying related stuff is of course welcome, but given the nature of the blog, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer gaming-related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll do some back and forth discussion to figure out the best way to present it, and then after wrapping up the series, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the results here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Business Part II: Marketing &amp; Pricing</title>
        <link>/gaming/2014-10-14-how-to-business-part-ii-marketing/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 22:40:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2014-10-14-how-to-business-part-ii-marketing/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2014-10-14-how-to-business-part-ii-marketing/ -&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all that build up, what is marketing? Let’s take a step sideways and start by defining the core purpose of all for-profit businesses: creating value for a customer and capturing a fair portion of that value. Marketing is not about getting something for nothing or ripping people off or tricking them. It’s not about polishing a turd or portraying a product as something it’s not. What marketing is about is making sure that your business gets some of that value created in the form of customer dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain what I mean by this potentially vague word value, allow me a brief digression on the value chain. Most things that you buy go through multiple stages of production and/or distribution before they get to you. Take a coke, for example. Somebody made the can. Somebody filled that can with just the right combination of sugar, water, and secret ingredients. Somebody moved it to a store. Somebody held it in a store and then finally took your money for it. Then you drank it (p’kssh, aahhhh). You can take this all the way back to the somebodies who dug the aluminum out of the ground for the can or the farmers who grew the corn used in the syrup, and so on. But all of these people contributed to you getting the value you got out of the coke, and all of them deserve a piece of that value. Marketing is what each link in the chain does to negotiate how much of that created value they get to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing often gets a bad rap as “making something out of nothing” or for hyping things that don’t deserve hype, and honestly, a whole hell of a lot of that goes on. But we’re not gonna do that. We’re better than that. Because we make things that we love, and so we know we’re starting with something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk about some elements of marketing and how you can apply them to selling your game stuff. As with accounting, there’s some super useful terminology that describes the core concepts of marketing, and it’s worth taking some time to define and elaborate on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminology--once-again-we-will-start-by-defining-some-terms-with-potentially-divergent-natural-language-and-business-terminology-meanings&#34;&gt;Terminology  Once again, we will start by defining some terms with potentially divergent natural language and business terminology meanings.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segmentation – The act of defining your customers and what they value in order to more effectively differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiation – The act of making your product distinct from similar products in a way that adds value and communicating those differences to customers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer – An individual who values what your product offers  Product – Any good or service provided in exchange for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand – The value possessed by a product due to the known qualities of its maker as distinct from the value derived from its intrinsic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value – the entire benefit a customer gains from the purchase or use of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;segmentation--differentiation--segmentation--segmentation-is-the-act-of-defining-your-customer-as-accurately-and-narrowly-as-possible-it-is-super-important-to-figure-out-who-your-customers-really-are-and-which-features-distinguish-them-if-you-dont-know-who-you-are-selling-your-stuff-to-or-what-they-want-you-cant-begin-to-figure-out-how-your-product-meets-their-needs-and-desires-or-how-to-let-them-know-that-it-does-game-players-probably-isnt-super-helpful-as-a-customer-segment-roleplaying-gamers-might-be-a-little-better-but-old-school-rpg-gamers-is-even-better-because-it-is-more-specific-even-from-there-you-could-probably-get-more-specific-if-you-tried-like-dccrpg-fans-versus-early-edition-traditionalists-or-the-like&#34;&gt;Segmentation &amp;amp; Differentiation  Segmentation  Segmentation is the act of defining your customer as accurately and narrowly as possible. It is super important to figure out who your customers really are, and which features distinguish them. If you don’t know who you are selling your stuff to or what they want, you can’t begin to figure out how your product meets their needs and desires or how to let them know that it does. “Game players” probably isn’t super helpful as a customer segment. “Roleplaying gamers” might be a little better, but “Old School RPG gamers” is even better, because it is more specific. Even from there you could probably get more specific if you tried, like “DCCRPG fans” versus “early edition traditionalists” or the like.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, marketers have spent a lot of time collecting easily gathered information (like basic demographic information) and hunting for characteristics that correlate with interest in their product. So, marketers might look at the survey data they’ve gathered and see that most of the people that like their product are suburban moms. Armed with this correlation (not causation, mind you) they decide to come up with an approach that appeals to what they think suburban moms want out of their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of room for error in that process, obviously, so fortunately, these days, we are lucky enough to be living in the computer age, and more information than you can possibly use is easily available. You can have customers create profiles so that you can track what purchases they do (and don’t) get, you can analyze what websites send you traffic that actually results in purchases versus window shopping, and collect other information that gets much closer to your customer’s actual buying behavior than what neighborhood they live in or how old they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better for us gamer-businesspeople is the fact that we are already embedded in a community whose wants and needs we deeply understand. Big companies try to create communities like we’re fortunate to have organically, and if you don’t abuse it, it is enormously beneficial. You have the trust to actually show people unfinished stuff, get feedback, and then later still be able to sell it for money. So you’ve got a big leg up on knowing your customer compared to most companies in most industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiation  At its most basic, differentiation is the process of establishing how your product is different from potential substitutes. The opposite of a differentiated product is a commodity: a product where the buyer’s only distinction between competitors is price. For most people, gasoline is  pretty close to a commodity, you buy it where it’s cheapest or most convenient, not because you love how much better your car runs with Exxon gas instead of Valero. As a business you don’t want to be a commodity, because as we’ll see below, competing on price is a mug’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If segmentation is the audience focused half of marketing, differentiation is the product focused half.  Of course, their relationship is a bit like the Yin and the Yang – each dynamically affects and depends upon the other. Having a differentiated product can drive segmentation decisions. For example, you have written an adventure for an old school game that takes especial advantage of that particular game’s rules, so you figure you will spend most of your time letting people who love that game know about your adventure and how it’s great for that game, and less time trying to sell it to players of other, compatible games. Alternatively, if you have a well-segmented customer group, you might choose specific ways to differentiate your product from others that cater to that segment. James Raggi knows his audience well: people who enjoy old school adventures with weird and/or shocking elements (segmentation). But he doesn’t stop there, he makes sure the books he publishes have top notch weird and shocking artwork and solid production value, something most old school adventure writers can’t or won’t match (differentiation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brand--brand-is-one-of-the-more-nebulous-overall-concepts-that-makes-up-marketing-but-it-is-a-very-important-one-its-also-a-concept-that-gets-a-lot-of-negativity-thrown-its-way-sometimes-for-good-reason-sure-so-lets-spend-some-time-talking-about-how-it-can-be-useful-to-customers-as-well-as-merchants&#34;&gt;Brand  Brand is one of the more nebulous overall concepts that makes up marketing, but it is a very important one. It’s also a concept that gets a lot of negativity thrown its way (sometimes for good reason, sure) so let’s spend some time talking about how it can be useful to customers as well as merchants.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Hell does “Brand” Even Mean, Anyway?  The definition given for brand in the terminology section is unfortunately pretty vague. Brand is a hard thing to pin down, but basically, it comes down to the value a customer gets out of a product because it was made by a particular company or has a particular name on it. This sounds suspiciously superficial and insipid, but it doesn’t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take D&amp;amp;D, a popular retroclone, and your own house rules as an example in contrasts for a moment. Fifth Edition D&amp;amp;D has some potential value that, say, Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry doesn’t, and both have certain value than your house rules don’t. With D&amp;amp;D, you can walk into any one of thousands of organized play events and find a game that to play, because it’s called D&amp;amp;D and made by Wizards of the Coast. Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry has value to people who want to be able to publish adventures that are compatible with a broad variety of old school games without an onerous licensing process, because it’s called Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry and Matt Finch made it. Your house rules have value to you because they are exactly what you want for your table, because they’re called whatever you want and you made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things that really are useful and valuable to some customers, and those customers will pay for that value in the form of being willing to pay higher prices for something with the right brand versus an identical offering without it. What would you pay for the current fifth edition Players Handbook? What would you pay for the entire text devoid of art, professional layout, and a legal copyright?  Why Are We Suspicious of It?  It’s pretty natural of us to be suspicious of people’s willingness to pay more for something only because of the name on the tin. What makes Advil worth more money than Walgreens ibuprofen? In a tightly regulated market where safety and packaging are guaranteed more by the government than by a medicine company’s desire to maintain a premium brand, I’d argue “not much.” Is that going to stop Pfizer from doing everything it can to get people to keep paying more for Advil than they do for generic ibuprofen? Of course not.  Cases like this where a brand’s premium over generics is maintained by ignorance or shaky justifications make many people suspicious of the whole concept of brands at all. To avoid having this suspicion leveled at your brand, my recommendation is simple: build your brand on the genuine qualities of you and your products, then stick to those qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is It Useful to Sellers and Customers?  When done properly, brand becomes shorthand for trust. If you see a can of Coke, you probably have very little doubt what it will taste like if you buy it and crack it open. You trust it not to make you sick and to most likely taste better than the store brand cola next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Old School gaming circles, the Lamentations of the Flame Princess brand has come to be synonymous with weird/horror elements, a real-world setting, and high production quality. You trust that if you click “checkout”, the physical books mailed to you all the way from Finland will be among the best in physical quality in all of gaming, and you probably trust that the content will be pretty weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trust helps out both customers and sellers. Customers don’t have to spend as much time carefully evaluating all of their options. Imagine if every old school adventure had nothing but a title and a brief description. Every time you ordered one, it’d be a crapshoot if it would fulfill the promise you found in the title. And that’s to say nothing of your search time. You’d have to go through the RPGNow page, adventure by adventure, reading titles, maybe descriptions, and it’d take forever to make an informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you can go “you know what, I may not always want to play LotFP stuff, but it’s always worth a read” then you can save yourself significant time and effort by just signing up for the LotFP newsletter. For a non-gaming example, I know that if I need some rugged outdoors clothing in a style and quality I appreciate, the Filson website is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the benefits to you the merchant include trust and some other intangible benefits, but also include some more concrete ones as well. If your customers know that you put out quality work that they will enjoy, that is valuable to them, and they will pay you more money for that added value. Think about what you’re willing to pay, sight unseen, for an adventure or game from your favorite designer versus what you’re willing to pay for a comparable amount of content from someone you’ve never heard of. That difference is the monetary value of brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Power of Specificity  Brands are most effective when they are specific. Even though you may be aware that Sprite is owned by the Coca Cola Company, it’s not sold as “Coke’s Sprite” for a very good reason. Coke means something much more specific, and they have expanded it very carefully. New Coke, which was a huge mess, was one of the Coca Cola Company’s few branding missteps because they lost sight of customers’ trust in the Coca Cola name and brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to be all things to all people almost always end badly.  Think about how universally reviled games are that succumb to printing ream after ream of splatbooks. Even if there’s some content that’s good or fun in one or two of those books, the sheer volume, the attempt to be everything takes away from the concentrated essence of the more limited original game or campaign setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specificity, on the other hand, creates a strong association for customers that can have a real financial impact. Take Dyson Logos – he makes some great adventures, and his magic rules and classes in Theorems &amp;amp; Thaumaturgy have a bunch of neat stuff, but his maps literally pay his rent. He’s the map guy. And it works for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, think about what you’re best at, and what your stuff accomplishes better than other people’s stuff. Then really play to those strengths. There are two main benefits to this approach: first, it keeps you focused on making what you love and feel good about. Second, it strengthens your brand as people come to associate good, consistent stuff with you. Now, if you have broad interests and want to pursue them, by all means, go nuts. But try to avoid the temptation to make something that you think will be popular or appeal to the broadest group of people only because there are a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Majority Fallacy  Which brings us rather neatly to the majority fallacy. This is not a formal logical fallacy like the sunk cost fallacy we talked about last time, but is instead merely a pretty reliable heuristic. The majority fallacy is the belief that the single largest market segment is the most desirable and most lucrative to pursue. Seems pretty straightforward, right? Want to make a lot of money selling something? Then sell something that everyone buys!  There’s two problems here, though. The first has to do with competition. Because the market segment is so big and so potentially lucrative, it attracts a lot of competition. Competition drives down profitability as rivals lower prices to get a bigger share of the market. The second problem is that the more broadly you define a market segment, the less you can do to target specific value for your customers through your product and brand. In other words, the more generic a market segment, the more generic the product that appeals to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by that second part? It is much easier to create a product that adequately satisfies the needs and desires of “old school rule loving, sword and sorcery reading roleplaying gamers” than it is to create a product that adequately satisfies the needs and desires of “all people who want entertainment”. It is often more profitable to be the only serious player in a small segment than it is to be one of many in a big segment. The entire RPG gaming scene is already pretty small and specific, so this isn’t too hard, but if you find yourself thinking that you’ve written the perfect game for all the players of OD&amp;amp;D, Pathfinder, and Marvel Heroic Roleplaying, maybe pause and reflect before putting it on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-four-ps--what-marketers-worry-about--having-laid-all-this-groundwork-about-segmentation-differentiation-and-brand-we-can-start-talking-about-some-of-the-nuts-and-bolts-of-marketing-the-four-ps-is-a-useful-framework-for-making-sure-youre-thinking-about-creating-and-capturing-value-holistically-rather-than-getting-caught-up-on-only-one-or-two-pieces-of-the-puzzle&#34;&gt;The Four P’s – What Marketers Worry About  Having laid all this groundwork about segmentation, differentiation, and brand, we can start talking about some of the nuts and bolts of marketing. The Four P’s is a useful framework for making sure you’re thinking about creating and capturing value holistically, rather than getting caught up on only one or two pieces of the puzzle.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product  This one is pretty simple, and there’s a reason it’s first: if you get everything else right, you’re still gonna have a lot of trouble selling something that sucks. Less pessimistically, everything else is way easier if you have a great product. What your product is will inform your decisions about what approach you take to selling it, how you price it, and in what ways you promote it. In pretty much every way that matters, you’ll have a very different time selling ice cream at a summer football game than you will at an open air mid-winter hockey game. Your product dictates your approach to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place  Place doesn’t just mean the physical (or digital) place you sell your product in, like “on RPGNow”. It’s everything that goes into getting your product to your customer. Print, e-book, or both? What kind of shipping? Fulfillment service or do it yourself? Direct sales or retail distribution? All that jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most RPG content creators, selling direct via low-fee services like RPGNow and Lulu makes the most sense. There’s value in selling via a marketplace with an established customer base – for most people it’s a fair trade to give RPGNow their cut per sale in order to sell your product in a way people trust, with automatic sales data tracking, and automatic order fulfillment. But these are all elements of how you get your product to your customers, and you can and should think about if they’re the right choices for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price  This one is complicated and important enough that it gets its own section below, and was named in the post title. In case you don’t remember from the accounting section, price is what your customer pays for your product, and after your product itself, it’s the most important piece of the marketing equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promotion  This is what most people think of when they think of “marketing” – it’s what you do to tell people why your product is great and how they can get it. Advertising, sales, encouraging word of mouth, pulling publicity stunts -  all of these things are examples of promotion. But so is writing a good blurb for the back of the book, figuring out what about your product will appeal to people and putting it into words, or making it easy for people that are looking for your stuff to find it through intelligent cataloging and search engine optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pricing--methods-of-pricing--so-the-traditional-method-of-pricing-is-whats-known-as-cost-plus-pricing-in-cost-plus-pricing-you-figure-out-how-much-your-thing-costs-you-to-make-you-figure-out-a-decent-profit-margin-apply-that-on-top-and-bada-bing-bada-boom-youve-got-a-price-theres-not-anything-inherently-wrong-with-this-approach-but-i-prefer-to-look-at-cost-plus-pricing-as-the-floor-of-what-you-should-price-your-product-if-you-arent-at-least-covering-costs-and-making-what-you-think-is-fair-you-should-either-change-price-or-sell-something-else&#34;&gt;Pricing  Methods of Pricing  So, the traditional method of pricing is what’s known as cost plus pricing. In cost plus pricing, you figure out how much your thing costs you to make, you figure out a “decent” profit margin, apply that on top, and bada-bing bada-boom, you’ve got a price. There’s not anything inherently wrong with this approach, but I prefer to look at cost plus pricing as the floor of what you should price your product. If you aren’t at least covering costs and making what you think is fair, you should either change price or sell something else.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s a method of pricing I like a lot better:  value in use pricing. This is a little harder to explain with stuff like games, so I’m going to go through a more concrete example, then apply it to less concrete stuff in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are considering whether to buy an inkjet printer or a laser printer for printing out your new zine. Given the rough, DIY aesthetic of your particular zine, you’re not concerned at all with picture quality, but because it’s meant to be inexpensive and accessible, you are pretty sensitive to keeping costs low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve narrowed down your choices to the InkMaster 5000 and the Lasertron 800. The InkMaster is cheaper off the shelf at $100, including ink cartridges, but the Lasertron has a cheaper refill cost. So let’s figure out what value in use price you might be willing to pay.  To start, we figure that in one year, you’re going to be a stellar zine maker and produce 12 zines. Each zine is 8 sheets of paper, front and back (folded into a tasteful digest, natch). So that’s 96 front and back pages per subscriber per year. Each InkMaster cartridge has a terribly small but very easy to divide ink capacity of 32 pages, and costs $40. The Lasertron can produce the definitely more reasonable 48 pages per toner refill. Toner refills cost $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, the InkMaster looks like a better deal – it’s cheaper to buy, and its refills are cheaper. But to get a full picture, we need to factor in frequency of refills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the InkMaster, in one year, you’re paying $100 + (3 x $40) = $220. If the Lasertron costs $130, it would be the same cost to you because you only have to refill twice ($130 +(2 x $45) = $220). That means that if the Lasertron costs you anything below $130 it’s a better deal than the InkMaster, even if the sticker price is higher than the InkMaster’s $100. The lower refill price is the in use value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were the maker of the Lasertron 800, trying to sell it to aspiring zine producers, you’d want to  price it as close to $130 as you could, and then highlight that even in one year it’s a better deal than the InkMaster, and the longer you use it, the better a deal it is to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this apply to gaming products? You want to price your product based on what it will do for the customer, not on how much it costs you to make it or how it compares to similar physical objects. RPG makers have priced comparable to books for ages, but recently Wizards has figured out that their real competitors are video games. That’s why your 5E core books are priced about as much as an Xbox or Playstation game. It’s why most core rulebooks are higher priced than adventures, even if they’re of comparable length – you can potentially get more use out of the core books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin  The whole goal of pricing is to maximize margin. You may be more familiar with it as profit margin, but for a variety of reasons, marketers prefer to just call it “margin”. There are two main ways you can calculate it: either as a percentage of cost or as a percentage of price (remember me saying this distinction was important back in accounting terminology?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example to show the difference:  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Item&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Cost&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Price&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Margin on Cost&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Margin on Price&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Whizzbanger&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;1.00&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;1.50&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(1.50-1.00)/1.00 = 50%&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(1.50-1.00)/1.50 = 33.33%&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;  Same item, same actual profits ($.50) -  but different percentage “margins” depending on whether you’re talking about the amount tacked onto cost or the amount of the total price that is profit. Both have their uses, but for your own personal use, just pick the one that makes more sense to you and use it consistently in your pricing decisions. The distinction is most often important when it comes to negotiating things with distributors: there are all kinds of old, arcane terminologies and agreements that are probably at least as old as the Dutch East India Company and they are based on different sorts of margins. So if you are going to enter into any sort of deal with a distributor, store or partner, look at how they define margin and how it gets split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you calculate margin, your price is the main variable you can adjust to affect it. In a hobby business, it’s unlikely you’ll reach a scale where you get significant cost savings by becoming more popular, and your costs will tend to stabilize after you figure out what you’re doing. So that leaves price as the only variable for you to adjust. Small changes in price without a change in cost can really affect your margin, especially when you consider that most transactions (like fees paid to a vendor) come out of your total price without regard to your other  costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look an example of what I mean. You’ve written an adventure that you think is pretty good, and you want to price it somewhere between $10 and $15. Here’s a table showing what a difference each dollar in price makes per sale:  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

You want to set it as high as the customer is willing to pay and not a cent higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuzzy Side of Pricing  So, now that we’ve talked about some of the nuts and bolts of pricing, let’s get into the fuzzier side of it. I’m a liberal arts kinda guy at heart, so I find this aspect of pricing even more fascinating than the margin discussion above, but you need the crunchy side in order to understand the importance and impact of the decisions you make on the fuzzy side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value  As I touched on in my introduction to marketing, the core concept when it comes to creating and selling something is not so much cost or price, but rather value. Different individuals and entities value things differently. That difference in valuation is what makes commerce possible (my employer wants me to make stuff for them, I want money, and so I have a job), but it also makes it hard to get value in use pricing right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some value is reasonably easy to quantify– almost everybody agrees that gold is valuable, so you can sell something made of gold for at least the going market rate for the amount of gold in it. Quantifying other value is much harder – I certainly value taking a walk on a pleasant fall day, but if I had to pay for it as the only way to experience it, would I substitute something else enjoyable for it? If I would pay for it, how much?  The goal of pricing is to capture as much value as you create/contribute to a product, so it pays to think a lot about what your customers value in your product, and how much. Now, this “capture” business may sound harsh, but it’s not meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re an artist, and you make some art for my book. People love the art, and I can sell my book for more money because it’s in there. Regardless of how I pay you, you have contributed value to the product: it’s better than it was because of what you did. So, I think it’s fair for you to get paid as much more than some other artist would as you added more value than they would have.    To put in terms of an example: if the average customer would pay $15.00 without your art, and $20.00 with it, then I am doing you a disservice if I don’t price it higher and pay you better for your contribution. The value to the customer from the art exists either way (it doesn’t get better or worse depending on how we price it). So our goal, as the people getting it to the customer, is to set the price as close as possible to the customer’s value of the end product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the value chain from up top? Every step in that chain should be capturing as much of the value that they contributed as they can, because outside of shitty coercive relationships, that process will lead to everybody getting a fair deal for their contribution, with the end result of the end user paying exactly what the product is worth to him or her. If it’s priced more than it’s worth to them, they won’t buy it. If it’s priced less, that means someone in the value chain didn’t get what they deserved for their contribution to putting it into the end user’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological Effect of Price  The other “fuzzy” element in pricing is the psychological effects of price on people’s perception of products. People have a really funny relationship to pricing. Price often acts as a convenient heuristic for quality, and it strongly affects our perceptions of something’s value even when we’re consciously trying not to let it. No matter how sophisticated you are about price and pricing in a given category of product, it’s really really hard not to let something’s stated price affect your perception of its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time you bought a product you’re not that familiar with as a gift, like wine. I am willing to bet cash dollars that you determined a price range based on what you thought was appropriate for the person and occasion, then used some secondary factor to pick from within that price range (employee recommendation? Coolest label? Whatever you do know about wine?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works the other way too. Most people assume low priced stuff is cheap. There’s an element (whether conscious or subconscious) that something must not be that great if it’s significantly less expensive than others of its kind. For this, I direct your attention to store brand groceries. Did you know that most of those come from the exact same factories or farms as the name brands and have the exact same ingredients?  That’s right – your Kroger or Giant brand ketchup and your Hunt’s brand ketchup are identical except for the label – the same ketchup squeezed out on the same assembly line. Ask me and I’ll go into the operational reasons the factories do this. But most folks assume that the cheaper store brand isn’t as good, and so if they have the money to spend, they go with the name brand that they trust (there’s that word again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when a product has strongly enough demonstrated value, these tendencies can be overturned. Say hard copies of Vornheim went on sale for $2.00. You’d be a fool not to take advantage of that if you were even remotely in the market for one, because everyone knows it’s high quality and it won a damn award. That’s why sales exist and don’t completely undermine the psychological effects we’ve been discussing when used sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you have to be careful with cutting prices, even temporarily. This deep, not entirely conscious, not even entirely rational association of price with value means that you have to be really careful about the implications for your products value when setting your initial price and even more careful if lowering your price. You might erode people’s perception of your product’s value, and you will definitely be getting a smaller margin per sale. As my marketing professor would say “lowering price is the laziest and costliest way to increase sales”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology of Price “Buckets”  Finally, for a more concrete and tactical psychological consideration, people tend to group things into price “buckets”. It can get really complicated because people might have general buckets (“$100 is a lot of money for anything”), broad category buckets (“$50 is a lot for an entertainment purchase”), or even specific category buckets (“$30 is a lot for a game purchase”). Every person’s buckets are different, but they are influenced by culture, the market, peers, and so forth. Big companies do a lot of market research to figure out what those buckets are for their average customer and then make products tailored to those buckets (wine makers have this down to an art).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I mean by “bucket”? Let’s say Bob wants to buy an adventure to run in his campaign. Bob loves buying adventures and knows that many great adventures are free, but he has a limited gaming budget, so his buckets for adventures go like this:  $0.00-$2.00: “Sure, I’ll pick that up!”  $3.00-9.99: “I’ll buy that if it’s got a good review”  $10.00-$14.99: “Maybe I’ll buy that if I know I like the author’s stuff already”  $15.00+: “This better be amazing, and I want multiple reviews from sources I trust to tell me it’s worth it.”  The point of identifying these buckets is that for Bob, any price within a bucket is functionally the same. Theoretically, it doesn’t really matter where your adventure is priced inside of one of those buckets. The prices in the bucket range are psychologically identical to Bob in his decision making, except for edge cases, like if Bob can only make one purchase and he’s torn between yours and another in the same bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, wherever possible, you want to figure out what the average “buckets” are for customers of your product, and then price at the top of whichever bucket you choose to be in. You can figure this out by examining your sales history at different price points or by talking to other people selling similar products if they’re willing to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing on buckets: notice that “$9.99”. For most people, that puts it in a different bucket than “$10” would, even though our rational, conscious brains know that that penny really doesn’t matter. You’ve been seeing it on shelves all your life because it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;considerations-in-a-hobby-market--so-far-ive-mostly-focused-on-the-business-portion-of-hobby-business-in-this-discussion-but-i-wanted-to-step-back-for-a-moment-to-talk-about-the-hobby-side-of-things-too-even-though-i-want-to-help-you-make-money-doing-what-you-love-chances-are-good-youre-still-a-customer-and-a-member-of-a-gaming-community-no-matter-how-successful-you-are&#34;&gt;Considerations In a Hobby Market  So far I’ve mostly focused on the business portion of “hobby business” in this discussion, but I wanted to step back for a moment to talk about the hobby side of things too. Even though I want to help you make money doing what you love, chances are good you’re still a customer and a member of a gaming community no matter how successful you are.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, as I discussed a bit in the intro, there is an old and wonderful tradition in the gaming hobby of sharing quality stuff for free. I know I’ve used plenty of great free stuff in my games, and I’ve shared plenty of free (if not great) stuff on my blog.  In the collaborative and reputation-based community of the OSR, there are plenty of ways to signal quality and value that are not price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these alternate methods of signaling quality, gamers have a somewhat easier time getting around that idea in the psychology section above about low price conveying “cheapness” than people in other fields. So don’t think that if you make one thing available for free, you will forever attaint your for-profit products. On the other hand, do be ready for people to expect higher production values or other improvements in your for-pay products than in your free ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most corners of the gaming hobby world, there’s also a sense of community and wanting to treat people right that you don’t necessarily get with faceless retail. I mean, if you go to buy a power drill from Home Depot, you expect to get a reasonable price and a functional tool, but you probably aren’t going to pay more at Home Depot than you would at Lowes because you like the way they run things there. It’s an arms-length business transaction with no hurt feelings all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a hobby community, that sense of fairness can be enormously helpful. One example of how great it can be for everybody involved is “Pay What You Want”. This goes against some of the psychology of pricing discussed above, but by giving your customers some agency, you’re taking what could be a simple transaction of money for goods, and turning it into a chance for interaction or even a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of people who want to support others in creating cool stuff simply to see them do more of it – that’s where things like Patreon come in. And there are opportunities, like Kickstarter, for people to demonstrate how much they want you to be able to make a particular thing into its best possible version. All of these ways for customers to show their support for creators rely on you building up trust and a reputation for quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to be careful to price things where you communicate your product’s value and get as much of what the customer is willing to give you for it, without coming across as greedy or ruthless about it. In a small, niche community market like RPGs, I think the best route is honesty and transparency combined with an unabashed pride in your work. Tell people why your stuff is great, and then tell them you’re charging for greatness. If you’re not an asshole about it, people will either enthusiastically give you their money, or else help you set your price somewhere more realistic without any rancor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appendix-three-common-marketing-pitfalls--leverage-the-brand--so-youve-come-up-with-a-game-world-that-people-are-really-digging-youre-selling-adventures-and-setting-material-and-its-doing-great-you-notice-people-really-dig-the-artwork-and-so-you-decide-to-do-a-huge-production-run-of-vintage-lunchboxes-featuring-some-fan-favorites-you-figure-you-can-sell-lunchboxes-to-your-existing-fans-and-at-the-same-time-get-into-the-vintage-lunchbox-market-unfortunately-it-turns-out-that-few-of-your-existing-fans-want-lunchboxes-and-lunchbox-aficionados-lack-any-context-for-the-artwork-and-dont-find-it-as-evocative-as-your-gamer-fans-do-youve-tried-and-failed-to-leverage-the-brand&#34;&gt;Appendix: Three Common Marketing Pitfalls  “Leverage the Brand”  So you’ve come up with a game world that people are really digging, you’re selling adventures and setting material and its doing great. You notice people really dig the artwork and so you decide to do a huge production run of vintage lunchboxes featuring some fan favorites. You figure you can sell lunchboxes to your existing fans and at the same time get into the vintage lunchbox market. Unfortunately, it turns out that few of your existing fans want lunchboxes, and lunchbox aficionados lack any context for the artwork and don’t find it as evocative as your gamer fans do. You’ve tried, and failed, to leverage the brand.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of D&amp;amp;D is replete with this mistake over and over and over again. When you have a strong brand - one that people know, feel strongly about, and buy things based on, there is an awfully strong temptation to slap that name on a new product. The assumption is that you’ll be able to sell something new to existing fans of the brand and simultaneously introduce new customers to its awesomeness. Well, you know what Admiral Ackbar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Dungeons and Dragons movie: execrable. Movie-goers not that familiar with D&amp;amp;D got a negative impression of the brand, and D&amp;amp;D fans got a negative impression of D&amp;amp;D-based movies.  Lose-lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the short answer? If you ever find yourself thinking that you can expand your business into a new product category or market segment by making use of existing goodwill/notoriety/brand, think long and hard about how the new product would fit into what makes your existing products resonate with your customers and whether the new product reinforces that or fights it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Educate the Customer”  You’ve thought up a sweet new game rule. It’s the most elegant and comprehensively thorough solution to a problem that has been plaguing you since you first put die to table and pencil to character sheet. You write a game based on this rule and put it up on RPGNow and wait for the dollars and accolades to come pouring in. But they don’t. Nobody buys it. What do you do?  Well, what you don’t do is think “I just need to convince everyone how awesome it is, then they’ll buy it.”  Sure, you might eventually be successful if what you have really is awesome, but it is much faster, easier, and more effective to instead ask yourself “who needs this and what do they need about it?” (remember segmentation and differentiation?) If you can answer that question, it becomes a matter of finding those people and letting them know you have what they want, rather than trying to convince people to want what you have.  If you ever find yourself thinking “if only the customers would just get it, I’d be doing great!” you might be looking at the wrong customers, pitching the wrong product, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll Make it Up in Volume”  You’re seeing a few sales here and there, but you’re not selling as many copies of your product as you’d like. So you start thinking “well maybe if I lower the price, I’ll sell more, and sales will go up enough that overall I’ll be more profitable!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the reasons discussed in the pricing section, this is a dangerous line of reasoning to follow. Besides the more obvious economic impacts of reducing your revenue without reducing your costs (lower per unit margin), there’s also the fact that you might inadvertently harm the reputation of everything you make, not just the discounted item. Say you write adventures and you knock one adventure’s price down a bit. People might start wondering why they should pay more for the others, and then you might be forced to cut prices on everything in order to sell anything.  Trying to make it up in volume is usually a bad move for any business, but especially as a hobbyist in a niche market, please don’t count on high volume to hit your goals. Price your product wisely based on its value to the customer, and high volumes will just be a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rzqcHHeoUyNEtpQjJPOURmM1E/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Template Ledger&lt;/a&gt;  Remember my warning in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/2014/10/how-to-business-primer-for-gamers.html&#34;&gt;intro&lt;/a&gt; that some stuff sounds lame and boring, but it’s important? Well, big surprise, accounting is one of those. Much as designing games requires understanding some basics about probability, understanding business requires some basics in accounting. Think of this like that bit in the front of the DMG. Even though it’s not as much fun as the others, I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to highlight what&amp;rsquo;s interesting and avoid the boring. I’ll do my best to keep it going, and if I&amp;rsquo;ve flubbed it anywhere, just remind yourself that it lays the foundation for the other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Brief Aside to accountants: If you are reading this, you are probably going to be horrified to learn that I’m not going to start with Financial Accounting, but instead I’m going to talk about cash accounting. I think if you get to the point where you need financial accounting to do better with your gaming business, you are past my tutorial and pretty firmly into “it would be really smart to hire a certified accountant, or at least buy Quickbooks” territory.]   [Brief Aside to non-accountants: If you don’t know what the hell financial accounting is, and you really want to know, ask me about it. Basically, it’s all that stuff with assets and liabilities and credits and debits that you may have heard of. Just know that “cash accounting” and “financial accounting” are related but different things, and to a hobby businessperson, cash accounting is probably more helpful.]  Cash Accounting Terminology  The single most important thing to learn for accounting is the terminology. You might assume that accounting would mostly require math, but if you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or tell a calculator to do so), you’ve got all the math you need for accounting.  The terminology is where it gets hairy – all of my professors compared accounting to a foreign language. See, there are a few words that have potentially vague or overlapping meanings in normal, human English, but have very specific definitions in accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By defining them exactly - as we might do with game terms in a highly legalistic game - we can talk with precision about what we’re doing. These are going to be important to all of the tutorials to follow, so I’ll probably link back to them. Some of these words have multiple meanings even in accounting, but I’m sticking to the most straightforward possible, and I will use them consistently. You may find some slight variations if you do some reading on your own, though. For now, here’s what you need to know:  Cost: What you, as the business, pay for things that go into making your own product   (What a fletcher pays for wood, feathers, and arrowheads is a cost to him)  Price: What your customer pays for the stuff you sell to him   (What the fletcher charges merry men for his arrows is its price)  Sales: Number of things sold  (The fletcher counts the number of arrows he sold today and that is his number of sales)  Revenue: The total money your customers pay you for all the things they bought. This ought to be equal to price times sales in most situations  (At the end of the day, the fletcher looks at how much money he got from people for arrows and writes his revenue for the day down in a ledger. He double checks that this number is equal to the result of multiplying his arrow sales times his arrow price. A more diligent merchant might have recorded individual arrow sales and associated prices and confirmed that the running total added up the same as sales times price, but our fletcher is not so sophisticated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit: The revenue minus the cost equals profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The fletcher takes his total revenue for the day and subtracts from it the cost for each arrow sold times the number of arrow sales, i.e. his total cost, to find out his profit for the day)  Obviously, Revenue/Profit and Cost/Price are potential sources of trouble, because in a non-business context, these can get used pretty interchangeably. I wish I had good mnemonics for memorizing these differences, but I don’t.  Maybe something to do with the difference between the poetic meanings of “without price” and “without cost”. But if you’ve ever learned the rules of a game that makes distinctions between a hit, a critical hit, and a wounding hit, I think you’ll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up a Simple Ledger  Now that we have the basic terminology laid out, we can start using it by setting up a simple ledger. I promise you this is not going to be as bad as “ledger” makes it sound. Spreadsheet software makes this way less tedious than it was for most of the history of accounting, but it’s useful enough that people were doing it the hard way with abaci and quill &amp;amp; ink for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get all the basics across, I’m going to run through an example with physical items, but at the end we’ll tie it into how these concepts can be applied to more intangible things. I recommend you follow along with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rzqcHHeoUyNEtpQjJPOURmM1E/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; linked at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you look at the template ledger on the January tab, you see columns for “date”, “item”, “cost”, “price”, and “profit”. The first row has an example item and a simple formula (price – cost) in the profit column. The second row links refers back to the inventory tab. We’ll walk through some pretty basic spreadsheet operation here, so you can skip some of this if you already know you way around a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

 **   **    Let’s make your ledger template look like this, and then we’ll examine it and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, open the Ledger Template and click on the January tab if it
is not already open. For the cheap arrow, simply copy the item name,
cost, and price from above into the 1/1/2014 line item (profit
should calculate automatically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the standard arrow, let’s do something a little different. Click
on the “inventory” tab, and replace the “Example Common Item” line
item with the information for the “Arrow” line item above (again,
leave the profit cell alone for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the January tab again, and notice that the name, cost, and
price have all changed to match what you put in inventory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click on row 5 (on the ‘5’ label to the left of the cells) and
click “Insert”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new row, copy over the information from “Fancy Arrow” above,
and copy one of the orange profit cells, and paste into the profit
cell for the Fancy arrow (you can remove the fixed reference color
coding if you want, and you can add a date)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click on the last row above the line and click “Insert”  **   **    So, now your spreadsheet should look like the example ledger above. You can see that each line item represents a thing that the fletcher has sold. He sold one cheap arrow, two arrows, and one fancy arrow. Each arrow has its own costs (feathers, wood, arrow head, et cetera), its own price, and then a per sale profit. At the bottom is the total costs, revenue,  profits, and sales for the period of time represented by the ledger. The fletcher might choose to record his costs, revenues, and profits separately per day, week, or other unit of time, or he might just keep a running total. The example here uses a month as small enough to be manageable, but large enough to have a meaningful number of entries. Feel free to modify for whatever time period works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things to note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost, price and profit are recorded on a per item basis, and total
costs, total revenues (the sum of individual prices), and total
profit are also recorded. It’s simple to capture the individual data
if you do it as you go, and it can prove useful later for analysis
(like finding out that your most popular item isn’t as profitable as
you think, or the like)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example, you actually arrived at the “Arrow” entries through
two different methods – the first one is a link to another sheet,
while the second was a simple copy and paste. Links between sheets
can be extremely useful for hiding the “guts” of a calculation where
they won’t mess up something where layout matters (like a ledger or
character sheet), and if you change something, it will change
everything linked. This is good and bad, see the inventory tab for a
warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Check box is never strictly necessary, and the calculations here
are simple enough that it might not help much, but it’s a good
practice to calculate the same answer two different ways and make
sure they match up, especially once you start getting into multiple
dependencies and nested formulas and the like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the Annual Sales Record tab, you’ll see that the info
you’ve entered has already been captured, thanks again to those
linked references&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to Track  The point of this ledger is to keep track of what you spend and what you make selling what you sell, so that you know how much better off you are monetarily. This is a pretty obvious point, but the nuts and bolts of it can get a little complex sometimes. In our example, costs, revenues, and profits are all very neat and tidy. I’m going to touch briefly on how such simple elegance can get messed up and more sophisticated solutions become necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to Assign Costs  Deciding where costs really “go” is quite possibly the hardest issue in accounting. Now, if you’re buying wood, feathers, and arrowheads to make arrows, costs are pretty straightforward – whatever you paid for your materials is your cost. But what if your son is the smith’s apprentice and he makes the arrowheads for you? Were those “free”? Will you know how it will affect you monetarily when your son completes his apprenticeship and gets too busy to make you arrowheads?   The point is that costs can be more complicated to assign to individual units than I’ve presented them here, and when they get too complicated, that’s where that “Financial Accounting” I mentioned up at the top comes in handy. Stuff like accounting for depreciation and intangible goods and what not. I’ll say more on it at request, but for now I think it would just bore most people and not do them much immediate, practical good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed Costs and Variable Costs  The simplest examples of the kind of complicated costs that might become an issue for you even as a hobby businessperson are Fixed Costs and Variable Costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variable costs vary with the number of units made or sold, and fixed costs do not. For example, if you are considering making custom miniatures for people with a 3D printer, the printer cost would be fixed (it costs the same to buy whether you make 1 or 1,000), and the plastic would be variable (make more miniatures, buy more plastic). Variable costs can also be based on how many units you sell – like if you pay for shipping instead of your customer or have to pay a per-transaction fee to an online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting for them is easy – for every unit, count the applicable variable cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some accounting issues I’m not going into here, and there’s a whole lot of interesting stuff to dive into in this area, but I’ll give you two options to get going on accounting for fixed costs:  1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of incurring the cost (buying the thing), estimate how
long you’ll use the thing. Divide the cost by that time, apply a
fraction of the cost to every unit of time you track (so, if you buy
the printer for 2,400 bucks and think that it’ll only last you two
years, apply a $100 cost to every month). This is a more
“accounting” answer – closer to what a CPA would do, but not
quite. Record it in your ledger as a line item with 0 price, and
thus a negative profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a spreadsheet to automatically calculate and update the “per
unit cost” for every unit you sell and add that cost into every
unit. This will result in your first sales being recorded as
unprofitable until you “break even”. This is a more “operations”
answer – closer to what a plant manager would do. When planning and
figuring out price, you’ll want to estimate a reasonable number of
sales to get an idea what your actual costs will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunk Cost Fallacy  The sunk cost fallacy is related to the idea of fixed costs. There are a lot of cognitive fallacies that affect our daily lives, but the sunk cost fallacy is one of the most common and one of the hardest to ignore. Basically it is the idea that you have to “make back” spent money. A harmless enough idea on its own (that’s the root of investing, after all), but it becomes pernicious when you justify spending more money based on the money you already spent. If you’ve ever felt disappointed at how much money you got from half price books for your game books based on the cover price you paid 15 years ago, you’ve fallen prey to the sunk cost fallacy. If you’ve refused to sell those books because of it, and they’re still sitting on your shelf unused, then you’ve been hurt by the sunk cost fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. Money you spent in the past? It’s gone. It is no longer rationally relevant to your decision making. It can be hard to sort out whether you are making a decision based on a rational expectation to recover fixed costs or an irrational expectation to make up a sunk cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist with distinguishing between rational and emotional motivations, allow me to introduce you to a simple statistical concept to aid in rational decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected Value  To find something’s “expected value” takes a bit of skill with percentages. Fortunately, my target audience is rich in exactly this skill. There are two components to an expected value:  1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of each possible outcome  2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of each outcome  Now, I may say “all possible outcomes”, but really it’s all the outcomes that it’s reasonable to consider. You probably don’t need to include the monetary impact of time traveling robot dinosaurs destroying your inventory, and you can skip things that are more plausible but will have a small impact if they do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 1) is the easier part. Usually you are evaluating some options, like: sell this printer now or hold onto it to keep making miniatures I can sell with it. If you don’t know exactly how much each value is worth, try to be conservative (err in the way less favorable to you) in your estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2) you figure out the likelihood of each outcome. Historical data is the most useful base for extrapolations here, but worst case you can “wing it” based on your best judgment, the same way you make up difficulty ratings for unexpected player actions on the fly. The more money involved, the more effort you should put into making sure this percentage didn’t come straight out of your ass, but if you’re honest with yourself and familiar with the subject, your estimate will probably be pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, multiply the likelihood of each outcome by that outcome’s value, and add them together. This is how much money you can reasonably expect to make or lose (even though it’s an abstraction in the same way you can “expect” all of a D&amp;amp;D character’s stats to be 10). Ta-daa! You’ve just found a weighted average.  For even more granularity, keep the results of multiplying each outcome by its likelihood separate and compare them – the (outcome x probability) with the highest dollar value is the most rational choice (if you got your inputs right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this isn’t a magical formula, and it should be used as a tool that aids in decision making, not the end all be all of decision makers. It is hugely dependent on good estimates, and the old software adage of GIGO definitely applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intangible Costs  I’ve purposely stuck almost entirely to “tangible costs” here – things you pay real dollars out of your paycheck for. When it comes to figuring out how much money you’ll make doing something you’d be doing anyway (because it’s the hobby you love) this works pretty well. But what about intangible costs? Stuff like your time, missed opportunities, or the wear and tear you put on your computer? These things have real value, but most of us don’t spend too much time assigning a dollar value to them. In a hobby business, it’s easy to think of the costs as being zero, but that’s not really true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole art and science that goes into figuring out stuff like this, but for this primer, I just want to get you thinking about the fact that pretty much anything that went into making your stuff could be considered a cost. The most salient example is likely your time. So, I’d encourage you to figure out a couple of things:   1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out how much time you put into each thing you make,  2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out what that time costs you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is a hugely imperfect measure of productivity in general, but it has the distinct benefit of being clearly measurable. So, if all of the time you devote to your hobby business is as enjoyable as anything else you could possibly use your free time doing, maybe it really isn’t a cost. Hell, maybe it’s practically like you’re being paid to do this stuff. But if any fraction of it is more work and less hobby, or even if any fraction of it is just less enjoyable than something else you could be doing, slap a cost on it, then apply that cost to the things you sell. Your time is valuable and you want to make sure you’re using it where you really want to. Monetary values can help throw that into stark relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Semi-relevant aside: want to compare what you’re making at your hobby to your job on an hourly basis? If you’re paid hourly, skip this part, you already know. If you have a salary, your pre-tax hourly pay can be roughly estimated by dividing your salary by 1,000, and then divide that by 2. So a $40,000 salary is roughly equivalent to $20 an hour, if you assume a 40 hour work week)  When Things Get More Complicated  Okay, so far I doubt anything I’m sharing with you has rocked your world that much. Basically I’ve recommended keeping careful records and giving a bit of thought to what goes into making your stuff. If you start to get to where you are hiring other people, setting up a separate business account, buying or selling things on credit, or the like, then it’s probably “talk to a CPA (professional accountant)” time. At the very least, start seeking out some knowledge on accounts and balance sheets (I’ll be happy to answer questions, but it’s not my area of expertise.)  Get thee to a spreadsheet!  As for how to actually get all this done, I invite you to open up the spreadsheet template linked at the top if you didn’t earlier and start monkeying around. Some of you are probably already hotshot excel jocks, considering you can make a wicked automated character sheet for a point buy game in it, but many of you may recoil from them in horror and panic. I’m here to tell you that if you can learn an RPG, you can use a spreadsheet just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that a full-on introduction to spreadsheets is a little out of scope for this tutorial, but I’ll be happy to provide more if people are interested. Instead, I want to prove my thoughts on a couple of options, and some pointers on getting better with spreadsheets. In the meantime, if you’re a total spreadsheet newb, I’ve made a template with labels and instructions to get you started. If you’re hungry for more, head over to youtube and search for “[spreadsheet program of your choice] tutorial”. There’s a ton out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet Options  I’m familiar with two main options for spreadsheets, but there’s a few others floating around out there (like Open Office):  Microsoft Excel – The standard for spreadsheet software, Excel has more hidden functionality than you’ll discover in a lifetime of looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros: support, functions, ability to use it at work without looking suspicious  Cons: expensive to buy, online collaborative version sucks  Google Docs – Has almost all of the functionality of Excel, but way better ability to collaborate and access remotely. The Labyrinth Lord to Excel’s D&amp;amp;D  Pros: free, good collaborative/remote access, consciously mirrors Excel functions  Cons: not quite as functional as Excel, access at the mercy of your internet connection, fewer tutorials and resources available  Some Tips For Spreadsheet Success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself going “I think I should be able to do this” or
“this seems like a complicated way to do something that should be
simple” – search for a tutorial. Chances are that you are right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is your friend. Whether on the official Microsoft help pages
or in forums, there are tons of people asking and answering
spreadsheet related questions, and Google is the best way to find
them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how your spreadsheet software handles relative versus fixed
cell references, and then learn to use them – it’ll save you from a
ton of headaches (This is explained a little more in the template).
Especially useful is renaming cells so you can reference them by
name in formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always try to minimize the number of times you have to enter data –
refer back to a single point of entry as much as possible, and
anything the spreadsheet can figure out automatically, let it do
that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How to Business: a Primer for Gamers</title>
        <link>/gaming/2014-10-07-how-to-business-primer-for-gamers/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 18:32:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2014-10-07-how-to-business-primer-for-gamers/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2014-10-07-how-to-business-primer-for-gamers/ -&lt;p&gt;Introduction and Philosophy  Why Business?  So, when I am not reading or writing about things like smelly goblins, interdimensional frog mind-palace adventures, or newer and better forms of magical undead, I am paid to do business things. I am paid to do this because I recently graduated from an institution of higher learning that seems to think that I am now a master of administering business.  I say this not to toot my own horn, but just so you know where this stuff is coming from – I had like zero business experience before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed business school and the things I learned there, and I want to share some of the best and most relevant stuff with the world of gamers who sell gaming stuff. Much of what business school teaches you is more relevant in a large, corporate context – how to get other people to get work done well, how to keep track of large quantities of money, and how to figure out the value of complicated substitutes for money. That stuff is fascinating and complicated, and many folks make big bucks figuring it out, which is why most folks go to business school in the first place. Unfortunately, most of that kind of stuff isn’t that useful to a guy or a gal sitting in their apartment who wants to make a little bit of money creating something they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to what I hope to accomplish with this and upcoming posts: I want to help out people who are just fine making awesome game stuff for free, but wouldn’t mind getting paid for it either. I think I can help in two ways – first, as someone lucky enough to have a decent job, I can buy the awesome stuff they make or contribute to their Patreon or other such things that put money in their pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I can share some of that business knowledge I’ve gained in a useful and entertaining way (I hope), such that geeks can make the most out of their hobby businesses. I’m not saying these posts are going to make you the next Wizards of the Coast, but if you make game stuff and people like it, I think maybe I can help you go from making beer money to making game money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Philosophical Aside on Creative Work, Community, and Filthy Lucre  A lot of people, especially a lot of creative people, see money as a necessary evil, and the acquisition of it as distasteful at best. I am not one of those people. I love money. Not in a real life gold for XP, “money is your score at life” kind of way. More like a “money  is a medium for different people with different values for things, work, and time to come to mutually beneficial arrangements” kind of way. Can money be put to bad uses and lure people into full-on, legitimately evil behavior? Of course it can, and all too often has. But I don’t blame the money for that. I think money is just an extremely flexible tool that can advance bad ambitions just as well as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I mean when I say I love money? I love that a company gives me dollars in exchange for things I make or do within a certain time period, and then like magic, I can give those dollars to someone else, who gives me access to their creativity and awesomeness. When those people let me use their awesomeness to have a good time with my friends, even better!  A huge, global corporation would never spend a cent on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.patreon.com/hackandslash&#34;&gt;Hack &amp;amp; Slash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/133404/Sleeping-Place-of-the-Feathered-Swine&#34;&gt;Sleeping Place of the Feathered Swine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/134386/No-Salvation-for-Witches&#34;&gt;No Salvation For Witches&lt;/a&gt;, but they will (and do) spend money on me, and I spend it on those things and more. The best part? Everybody’s happy – we all get what we want out of the exchange. I think that is some pretty powerfully cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize, though, that not everybody looks at money like this, and often with good reason. I’m not trying to bring you around if that’s the case. For some people, money and creativity don’t mix. For others, it’s a moral or political thing. And for some, the reward of people seeing and enjoying your stuff is worth way more than any amount of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you like giving your stuff away for free, if that is part of the appeal, keep doing that. It’s awesome! Those of us who benefit from your sweet, sweet generosity love you for it. I’m not trying to turn anybody into an RPG Scrooge McDuck, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend more time doing what you love because you make money doing it, that’s fantastic. Maybe you don’t have to work as long hours at your job. Maybe you can take a job that’s less stressful and it’s easier to be creative in your free time. Or maybe with some money coming in, you can more easily justify to yourself or people who depend on you the time you spend. Like I said, I think any of those would be great, and I want to help you make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s in it for you?  Maybe you’re reading all this and going “yeah, that’s fine for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;geniuses&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;prodigies&lt;/a&gt; out there, but I can’t make money doing what I do.” Well, I honestly believe that if you’re making stuff that gets your motor going, then it probably does somebody else’s too, and people are generally willing to pay something to get their motor going. “Stuff” here is very broad – people have and will pay for things as diverse as blogposts, maps, podcasts, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These posts will help you to connect with the people willing to pay for what you put out, price it where everybody gets a fair deal, and then keep track of the money and how to make smart decisions with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to Expect  I’m going to write a series giving an overview of the most relevant and useful things I learned in business school in the context of creating stuff for roleplaying games. Now, some of these posts might look like they’re going to be kind of boring (I’m looking at you, accounting), but trust me when I say that I will be trying only to include things that are important and relevant. I’ll make an effort to tie everything back into the big picture as we go along, so we shouldn’t spend too much time deep in the weeds with overly technical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics I plan to do are below, with the last being a follow up answering any reader questions. Going forward, if I ever get any questions or think of anything that seems useful, I’ll revisit the topic. When I finish the series, I plan to make a pretty quick and dirty .pdf available to collect everything together in one place, so feedback on how to improve the material or what’s assumed/not covered will be quite welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Call of Cthulhu Character Creation Resources</title>
        <link>/gaming/2014-09-10-call-of-cthulhu-character-creation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 21:46:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2014-09-10-call-of-cthulhu-character-creation/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2014-09-10-call-of-cthulhu-character-creation/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k-YuZu2W80k/VBEorXK2HVI/AAAAAAAABQk/sdH4F_-RXxY/s1600/July-1-Smackover-roughnecks-AOGHS-e1357569547667.jpg&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k-YuZu2W80k/VBEorXK2HVI/AAAAAAAABQk/sdH4F_-RXxY/s1600/July-1-Smackover-roughnecks-AOGHS-e1357569547667.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be running a Call of Cthulhu scenario for the next three weeks as a kick off to my group&amp;rsquo;s Halloween season horror game anthology (3 games of 3 weeks each). I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting the scenario here once I finish writing it (I need something playable by Monday, so don&amp;rsquo;t expect too much of a wait), but in the meantime, here are a couple of resources I&amp;rsquo;ve put together for my players to get started with the character creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;automated-character-sheet-and-character-creation-walkthrough--call-of-cthulhu-character-sheet-templatehttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1auriqxdxztnsemz1_k-donqyay_y5g288uhqfxdbdyoedituspsharing&#34;&gt;Automated Character Sheet and Character Creation Walkthrough  &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AURiqxdxZTNSEmz1_K-DoNQyAY_Y5g288UHqfXdBDYo/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Call of Cthulhu Character Sheet Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an excel character sheet and have uploaded it to Google Docs for ease of access and sharing. If you want to make use of this, I recommend you copy it to a Google docs folder of your own or download it as an excel file. The formulas are based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/101292/Call-of-Cthulhu-QuickStart-Rules&#34;&gt;free Call of Cthulhu quickstart rules&lt;/a&gt; and the skill list comes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/55567/Trail-of-Cthulhu&#34;&gt;Trail of Cthulhu&lt;/a&gt; with a couple of additions for my setting. The occupations list is from Trail of Cthulhu with a few additions from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/120260/tremulus&#34;&gt;Tremulus&lt;/a&gt; and of my own creation for the setting. I think it should retain all the cool conditional formatting and formulas and what not. There&amp;rsquo;s a few setting-specific notes for my 1930&amp;rsquo;s Texas boomtown game, but those are pretty easy to change or ignore.   ### Name List Weighted for 1933 Texas Demographics  &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Random 1933 Texas Man and Woman&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dk5uMk5X7NQrOYN7XZDa67r9Z_iWn_OzxWK-riBwYok/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;1933 Texas Name Lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I needed a name list for my game and I maybe went a little over the top. I found the top 100 US given names for the decades of the 1890&amp;rsquo;s, 1900&amp;rsquo;s, and 1910&amp;rsquo;s, so that I&amp;rsquo;d have the most common American given names for adults in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s. I eliminated duplicates and made a list of male and female names(a little over 200 names). You can use the top 100 if you want a D100 list, or use the generator link if you want all of them involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For surnames, I went even crazier. I found a Texas Almanac from 1933 and found the ethnic mix of the Texas population by percent. Then I found surnames from the representative ethnicities&amp;rsquo; countries. So, for example, I found English, Welsh, and Scottish surnames for &amp;ldquo;whites&amp;rdquo; and I found another statistic for what portion of Texas whites were German in origin and used that percent for German surnames. I had to use modern most common surnames in most cases, but I figure there&amp;rsquo;s probably less variation there than given names and I had to work with what I had. Anyhow, I took all this craziness, and I used the percent of population to figure out how many names on a d100 list should come from that nationality. For example, by assuming a little over half of the 73.5% white population were English/Welsh by descent, I picked the top 36 names from the English/Welsh surname list. Then I repeated the process for the top however many names for each ethnic group (I used &amp;ldquo;English/Welsh, Scottish, Black, Latin American, and German&amp;rdquo; which neglected Czechs, Irish, and any other Ethnic groups, but I think worked out pretty well). Sure, an oil boomtown would probably have more immigrants from other states than the rest of Texas, but I figured too much realism isn&amp;rsquo;t that necessary. I probably already got more involved than necessary, but you can reap the fruit of my labors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall this should work pretty well as an &amp;ldquo;American Name&amp;rdquo; generator for most of the 20th century, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing out on some of the diversity of later times and/or other regions. If you get a result that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to make sense like &amp;ldquo;Juan Schmidtt&amp;rdquo; either figure out a cool backstory or roll again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2014-08-17-adventuring-companies-expeditions-and/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-abIA7iiktSA/U_GGLQOqi6I/AAAAAAAAA-I/_lQwcr-Xfsg/s1600/Mayan-Ruins-by-DoktorRengen-on-deviantART-Google-Chrome_2012-12-12_13-06-03.png&#34;&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-abIA7iiktSA/U_GGLQOqi6I/AAAAAAAAA-I/_lQwcr-Xfsg/s1600/Mayan-Ruins-by-DoktorRengen-on-deviantART-Google-Chrome_2012-12-12_13-06-03.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve been slow the last couple of months, and I apologize. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely lucky to be working on a layout project that should turn out to be something pretty cool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to advertise it loudly until it&amp;rsquo;s closer to completion. The downside to this very exciting news is that my own personal hobby projects, like the Adventure Companies one, is going on the back-burner (still thinking about it and working on it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make it a priority of my gaming hobby time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been a while, so I wanted to get the stuff that was near completion out the door, so to speak. This post gets us really close to being complete on rules except for setting creation rules, so if you see any major flaws in how this whole thing works, let me know now. The rules in this post are for companies setting out into the wilderness, moving around the map, finding sites of interest (mostly dungeons) and engaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expeditions  The Expedition Turn  The default expedition turn is one day. Each turn, a company can take two of the following actions:          - March          - Explore          - Engage  - Rest  **   **  Supplies  Every seven turns (a week) each person consumes one food resource, each pack animal consumes two, and anything especially large or special like an elephant or an ogre consumes 3.  March  Marching is the movement of companies over long distances. For each march action, the company can spend its full available movement points.     Areas  The unit of movement and exploration in these rules. The default area is a 6-mile wide hexagon.   **   **  Movement Points  Each company has a movement score in its company profile, determined by the slowest member of the company. A normal company consisting of men and normal riding or pack beasts has 6 movement points. [Cross reference with company section for movement points. Add movement point calculation to company section]  **   **  Movement Costs by Terrain  Each area costs a certain number of movement points to enter from an adjacent area based on its terrain type. If multiple terrain types are applicable, always use the most difficult terrain cost. A company can always move at least one area.   Example terrain costs:          - Plains or roads: 2 points          - Hills, light forest: 3 points          - Heavy forest, foothills: 4 points          - Mountains, dense jungle, extremely rough terrain: 6 points  Encumbrance  If anyone in the company is encumbered, reduce the company’s available movement points by 2.  Navigation Rolls [Should I come up with some way of indicating “core” and “additional” rules, or present all rules as totally modular?]  Before beginning a march, the controlling player announces the intended route, including all areas to be moved through. The player then rolls the best navigation skill in the company. If the skill check is passed, the company proceeds on the intended route. If the skill check is failed, the company’s initial direction will be wrong. It will then make the same planned turns and move the same planned distance, if able. Determine the actual initial direction on a failed navigation roll by rolling 1d6 [Probably format this cleverly – next to the paragraph, so that not as many words are needed]:          1 - Opposite of intended direction          2-3 - 45 degrees left of intended direction          4-5 - 45 degrees right of intended direction          6 - Intended direction  Encounter  In each area moved through, there is a 1 in 6 chance of a random encounter. If an encounter is rolled, roll on the appropriate terrain type’s encounter table. Completely resolve the encounter before continuing movement. A company may choose to stop and forfeit the rest of its movement after resolving an encounter. [I figure it would be redundant to hash out encounter rules here, right?]  Travel roll  2d6 – Highest Terrain Cost Paid to Enter an Area this Action. Indicates how well members of the company dealt with the rigors of the route. Test after all movement is completed in a single action. A roll of 5+ is a success and there are no effects. A failure indicates that one random unit loses one hit point.  **   **  Example Resolution Using all Rules:          1) Announce intended route          2) Make Navigation Roll          3) Spend movement points and move company          4) Check for an encounter in each area          5) Resolve any encounters          6) Make Travel Roll and resolve results  **   **  Explore  A company can attempt to locate sites of interest in an area by using an explore action. The controlling player rolls 1d6 – two times the number of already discovered sites of interest in that area. A result greater than 0, or a roll of “6” indicates that a site of interest has been discovered in that area. The maximum number of sites of interest in one area is six.  **   **  Whether or not a site of interest is discovered, an explore action grants a cumulative +1 to the next navigation roll the company makes.  **   **  Engage  A company can use an engage action to interact with a known site of interest, a settlement, another company, or any other entity within the area it occupies.  **   **  Rest  For every turn where at least one action was not spent resting, the company and its members take a cumulative -1 to all rolls on the next day. A single rest action resets these penalties to zero. Each consecutive rest action beyond the first provides a cumulative +1 to the next travel roll.  **   **  Order of Actions  Unless order of action becomes important, expedition turn actions are considered simultaneous. When order of action is important, use the following precedence:  - The company that rested most recently acts first for movement or exploration  - A company exploring an area where it began the day may act before companies that moved  - If otherwise tied (such as resting at the same time or beginning in the same area), proceed from the smallest company to the largest  [I could use some help with wording this as carefully as possible without getting too wordy]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites of Interest  Creating a Site of Interest  **   **  Elements  Site of Interest - A fixed location that can be engaged by a company to extract treasure such as ruins, a dungeon, or a mine  Tier - The level of detail at which a site of interest is created  Level - A level is a grouping of encounters within a site of interest.  Difficulty - Skill Check encounters have a difficulty modifier that reduces a unit’s effective skill for that encounter that is equal to 1d4 - 1  Skill Check - an encounter that is passed by successfully rolling equal to or less than a unit’s named skill. Failure results in 1d6 x the difficulty modifer HP damage to a random unit in the company.  Combat - Encounters that involve a fight.   Default is a company with 1d6 HD, AC 1d6 better than unarmored.   1: improve AC by 2  2: improve HD by 2  3: can cast 1 random spell (of lvl 1d4) once  4: Does +2 damage per attack  5: Has a randomly determined skill at level 1d6, finds ways to use it  6: another ability and roll again  Exhaust - An encounter is exhausted after it is engaged. An exhausted encounter cannot be engaged.  Refresh - Some encounters refresh after being exhausted. A refreshed encounter no longer counts as exhausted.  **   **  Tiers  Tier 1  a) Randomly determine a skill for the Skill Check  b) Company performs a Skill Check  d) Success exhausts the site, and allows the company to remove up to the total treasure value of the site  e) Failure ends the engagement action in addition to any other consequences  **   **  Tier 2  **   **  a) Roll 1d6 for number of Skill Checks  b) Randomly determine each Skill Check &amp;amp; Difficulty modifier  c) Each check must be attempted in the order determined, failure ends the engagement action  d) the total amount of treasure determined for the site of interest is divided equally among encounters. Treasure can be recovered from any successfully passed encounters  e) any successfully passed encounters are exhausted  **   **  Tier 3  a) Roll 1d6 for total number of encounters  b) Determine if each encounter is a skill check or combat: 1-4: skill check, 5-6: combat  c) the total amount of treasure determined for the site of interest is divided equally among encounters. Treasure can be recovered from any successfully passed encounters  d) any successfully passed encounters are exhausted  **   **  Tier 4  a) Create a Flowchart  i) Roll 1d6 for Levels  ii) Each level has 1d4 encounters  iii) Each encounter has 1d2 connections to encounters on next level and 1d2-1 connections to encounters on same level  b) Determine if each encounter is a skill check or combat: 1-4: skill check, 5-6: combat  c) the total amount of treasure determined for the site of interest is divided equally among encounters. Treasure can be recovered from any successfully passed encounters  d) any successfully passed encounters are exhausted  **   **  Tier 5  An adventure or skirmish using more granular rules.  **   **  Nature of Site of Interest  a) roll 1d6: 1-3 Site of Interest is human, 4-6 Site of Interest is Monster  b) roll 1d6-2 for number of weeks it takes encounters at site of interest to refresh after being exhausted. A result of “0” or less indicates that encounters at this site of interest never refresh  **   **  Treasure  After a company resolves an engagement action at a site of interest for the first time, determine the treasure at the site of interest in the following manner:  a) the base treasure for a site of interest is 3d6 x 10 treasure units  b) for each encounter, add 1d6 x difficulty modifier for skill checks or 1d6 x HD for combat   **   **  Site of Interest Record Sheet  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
