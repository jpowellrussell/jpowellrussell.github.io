        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-03-18-dogs-in-vineyard/ -&lt;p&gt;Okay, long time, no post. I apologize, and will try to make with the regular updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m going to set aside my more general and theoretical speculation about RPGs and discuss some concrete examples. Of course, I plan to sneak general applicability into my discussion, but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become acquainted with some games that get me very excited, and I want to talk about why. This is still going to be a part of my &amp;lsquo;starter RPG&amp;rsquo; series, because I approached these rules not only as potentially fun games in and of themselves, but with a critical eye towards innovations and techniques worth steeling, with ease of use by new players as the lens through which I viewed these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first game to discuss is going to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lumpley.com/dogsources.html&#34;&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. I mentioned this game in my last post as an example of a just barely alternate history western. No steam powered airships or undead gunmen, just lots of pseudo-Mormons. That being said, the game purposely leaves the setting vague and invites you to experiment and switch things around to your and your players&amp;rsquo; tastes. This game also has the distinction of being one of two on my list by the same creator, D. Vincent Baker. His games were highly recommended throughout the online RPG community as great examples of what &amp;ldquo;Indie Games&amp;rdquo; can and should be, and I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to them like a weasel to a bag full of suet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general introduction to the game, players take on the role of &amp;lsquo;Dogs&amp;rsquo;, the colloquial name for protectors of the faithful. &amp;ldquo;The Faith&amp;rdquo; is purposely left vague, but as presented in the game is basically early Mormonism. The Dogs journey from town to town and see to the spiritual ills of the communities. But they&amp;rsquo;re not priests in the normal sense, as their job is to see only to those spiritual troubles that have spilled into concrete actions, like spite, jealousy, and murder. With that established, you basically have a reason for a group of people to go from town to town and get into conflicts in good wild west fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first interesting feature of the DITV rules is that dice are used as stats, from D4s up through D10s. Stats can also be a mix, e.g. 2D6 1D4, which would mean that stat has all three of those dice to put towards a conflict. More on how the dice are used in conflict resolution in a moment. What&amp;rsquo;s cool here is that higher numbers beat out lower numbers, so while a D6 gives you a better probability of beating a D4, a 3 beats a 1 whatever die it&amp;rsquo;s rolled on.Â  You&amp;rsquo;ll also see that the number of dice versus the value of the dice (i.e. having 2D6 rather than 1D8) has more effect than just smoothing out your probability. I like this feature because D&amp;amp;D tricks a lot of us into the default position of &amp;ldquo;die roll plus number vs difficulty&amp;rdquo;, or if you&amp;rsquo;re more old school &amp;ldquo;die roll versus number, roll lower&amp;rdquo; to succeed. Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with a roll + stat (+ skill) type approach, but it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to be reminded that this isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way to do it. Of course, another popular system, Storyteller is similar, where your stats and skills are basically the number of D10s you roll vs a target number, and then you see how many successes you have, but the introduction of multiple dice types adds some subtlety. Plus all those crazy dice are cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really cool, though, is not that you use dice for stats, but how those dice factor into conflict resolution. First off, you determine what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;at stake&amp;rdquo; in a conflict. At the end of the conflict, whoever is left will get to decide what happens to what&amp;rsquo;s at stake. Then you figure out the specifics of where it&amp;rsquo;s taking place (anything that might be important like who&amp;rsquo;s watching, chairs that could be smashed, exits that could be escaped through, et cetera). Then you figure out who&amp;rsquo;s participating. At this point, everybody participating takes up the relevant dice and throws them all at once. The dice you roll depend on what category the conflict starts out in: Just talking, physical, physical fighting, and gunplay. If a character has a relationship at stake, or has relationship dice representing his opponent in the conflict, he rolls the relevant relationship dice (relationship dice can cover the obvious like brother, uncle, or what have you, as well as less obvious like &amp;lsquo;the town drunk I helped home one time&amp;rsquo;). That&amp;rsquo;s it for the initial dice. Dice for traits and things come up when and if they&amp;rsquo;re used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, everybody involved has their dice rolled and out on the table. Whoever&amp;rsquo;s opening the conflict starts out by picking two dice to use as his first &amp;ldquo;raise&amp;rdquo;. You can choose any two of your dice, and as you put them forward, you must describe what action those dice represent. The action is something your opponent can&amp;rsquo;t ignore, and must fit the scope of the conflict you&amp;rsquo;re currently at (so if you&amp;rsquo;re just talking, you can&amp;rsquo;t describe your action as punching a guy in the face, you have to escalate to physical conflict for that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your opponent will then attempt to &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; your raise. He can put forward, one, two, or more dice to see. If he can match your raise with only one die, he has &amp;ldquo;reversed the blow&amp;rdquo; and takes no negative effect, and in fact reverses it against you. He gets to keep that die to use when it&amp;rsquo;s his turn to raise. If he uses two dice to see, he has somehow negated the effect of your action with no negative effect to either of you. If it takes 3 or more dice to see, your opponent &amp;ldquo;takes the blow&amp;rdquo;, which means he&amp;rsquo;s still in the conflict, but he takes a negative effect for your action. After the conflict is resolved, he&amp;rsquo;ll take a number of fallout dice equal to how many dice he had to see with. The size of the fallout dice increases depending on the type of conflict (each fallout die from just talking is a d4, while fallout dice from shooting are d10s). Finally, if an opponent can&amp;rsquo;t or won&amp;rsquo;t see a raise, he can &amp;lsquo;give&amp;rsquo;, which means he&amp;rsquo;s out of the conflict, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t take any further fallout dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players then take turns raising and seeing. If there are more than two opponents, one player will raise, each other affected by your action will see, then the next player will raise and each other will see, and so on. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say you run out of dice to see or raise, but you&amp;rsquo;re not happy with where the conflict is ending, what do you do? You escalate! This is where you go from, say, just talking to making a break for it, or throwing a punch, or drawing a gun. When you escalate, you look at what stats are appropriate to the new type of conflict and roll those dice. You can only ever roll a stat, trait, or thing once in a conflict, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve already used one stat for a lesser type of conflict, you don&amp;rsquo;t reroll it when you escalate. Likewise, once you&amp;rsquo;ve introduced a trait or item, you don&amp;rsquo;t get to roll it again no matter how many times you use that trait or thing. Eventually, somebody gives by choice or by being out of things they can roll, and whoever is left in the conflict decides what happens with what&amp;rsquo;s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conflict, those fallout dice mentioned get rolled, and depending on what&amp;rsquo;s rolled, you get experience, short term effects, long term effects, minor injuries, serious injuries, or you&amp;rsquo;re dying. Note that due to the size of dice associated with different types of conflict, you can&amp;rsquo;t get injured from a conflict that never escalates past &amp;lsquo;just talking&amp;rsquo; and you can&amp;rsquo;t end up &amp;lsquo;dying&amp;rsquo; unless guns come into the picture (a bit of dramatic license here, since obviously stabbing or severe beating could kill someone, but the game is set up so that such unglamorous things won&amp;rsquo;t off your character unless you want them to for dramatic reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a really rough outline of the conflict resolution, and examples make it much clearer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to reproduce too much of the rules here. The point is that the rules are heavily narratively focused, and they give a lot of narrative power to the players, since if they win the conflict, they dictate how it ends and what effects it has. A lot of the &amp;lsquo;fallout&amp;rsquo; also isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily bad, as even ostensibly negative effects can help you have more say in narrative events (for example, you might do something like gain relationship dice of &amp;lsquo;hated foe&amp;rsquo; with the guy who kicked your ass, which could be used any time you&amp;rsquo;re in conflict with him from then on). I also like the back and forth nature of conflict resolution. One of the subtler points of the system is that it quietly encourages both the players and the GMs to escalate conflicts while still allowing meaningful resolution without escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for traits and things is extremely open ended. You&amp;rsquo;re given a certain number of dice to assign, and you can make up whatever traits or things you want with those dice. While some obviously useful things can be chosen like &amp;ldquo;Good Shot&amp;rdquo;, you can also go for potentially more interesting approaches, like having a trait &amp;ldquo;I love my gun&amp;rdquo;. Sure, the first one would come up whenever you need to shoot well, but the second one might have more scope, but still might help out when making a shot with your particular gun. Even seemingly non-useful things like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a drunk&amp;rdquo; can give you more say in certain conflicts, but in others your opponent gets to use them. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend this system to extremely munchkiny players, as the only limit on &amp;lsquo;min/maxing&amp;rsquo; is the combined opinion of GM and players. With a group sufficiently dedicated to narrative play, however, it is an extremely flexible and empowering tool for coming up with and resolving in-game conflicts.   Which leads me to perhaps the most abstract benefit of these rules I gleaned, namely the focus on conflict. You&amp;rsquo;ll see the same thing when I review &amp;ldquo;In a Wicked Age&amp;rdquo; by the same designer. In both games he elucidates that the key source of interest in an RPG is conflict in which the players participate. This is usually most obviously represented by the strong focus on combat in most RPGs, but it supports a conclusion I discovered on my own years ago with one of my first forays into game design. Around about 6th and 7th grade, a few friends of mine and I tooled around with on-the fly games in order to play in settings for which we had no game system at the time (which was pretty much everything except D&amp;amp;D - we played a Final Fantasy III RPG, a Middle Earth RPG, and numerous others). After a while, I got bored with doing nothing but proceeding from fight to fight and sought the opposite extreme of a game with no fighting. I created a game based on running your own business and only ever ran a session or two with a friend of mine as the only player. Pretty quickly the reason for fights in games became evident: it was awfully boring. Strangely enough, my friend who I was running for enjoyed it and requested to play it for some time after, but I&amp;rsquo;d always put him off because I got bored running it with no fights to design and run. What I had failed to grasp was that conflict is what provides excitement and drama, and at the time I was too inexperienced and unknowledgeable to create conflict that wasn&amp;rsquo;t fighting. Both &amp;ldquo;Dogs in the Vineyard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;In a Wicked Age&amp;rdquo; do an excellent job of pointing out that conflict comes in many forms and providing rules for handling all those forms consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of the most useful parts of the rules is its system for town generation. Not simply a system for coming up with what buildings and businesses exist in a town, it starts with the assumption that the players wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go there, or at least play time wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used, if there were no conflicts there. So, the system also creates ready made conflicts for the players to walk into the middle of. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen to quickly and easily create a dynamic and engaging environment for gameplay, and it provides for rich roleplaying and decision making without any sort of overarching storyline or plot. In fact, in this game as well as in &amp;ldquo;In a Wicked Age&amp;rdquo;, D. Vincent Baker discourages the GM from having set storylines in mind, saying that this takes away agency from the players and results in something less like a game and more like a &amp;lsquo;choose your own adventure&amp;rsquo; book with the GM as the author. This is a valuable point to keep in mind, because most GMs, myself included, love creating intricate worlds and epic storylines (it&amp;rsquo;s a large part of why we want to GM instead of play). The trouble is that your job as GM is not to provide novel-worthy plots or history book worthy detailed settings, it is to facilitate your players having a good time, and if your players don&amp;rsquo;t want to explore the plot or world details that you&amp;rsquo;ve painstakingly created, it&amp;rsquo;s not fun to railroad them into it anyway. Fortunately, both of his RPGs I&amp;rsquo;ve read do an amazingly job of providing resources to come up with interesting, rich roleplaying situations on the fly that allow tons of room for player ownership and involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ll close with an analysis of what I do and don&amp;rsquo;t want to take away from these rules for a starter RPG and why I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll use it &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo; and instead will continue with designing my own. To address the last point first, I have to admit that part of the reason for designing my own game is because I like designing games. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to not let that be the leading reason, as having a fully home grown game that is less readily available than some other already created game inherently limits its usefulness and options, as any players that get used to it will only be able to play it with me running it or with our circle of gamers. So I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep an open mind about finding more widely popular games that adequately address all of the issues I want to see covered in a starter RPG. That being said, while I think &amp;ldquo;Dogs in the Vineyard&amp;rdquo; is an excellent game that I would love to run or play, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the best choice for a brand new group. First off, it demands a lot of its players as well as its GM. I feel like the level of player control of narrative and responsibility in choosing traits and things for character development reasons rather than concrete benefit might be a little much for people first introduced to gaming. On the other hand, maybe setting the bar high on such levels of player responsibility and involvement would be inculcating good habits. I also feel that the core mechanic, while elegant and flavorful, is a bit much to explain to complete neophytes, though the popularity of poker makes the rounds of &amp;lsquo;raises&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;sees&amp;rsquo; perhaps more accessible. Also, the game lends itself to weighty moral questions and dramatic situations rather than the easier pleasures of high adventure and heroics. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;d like there to be some elements of the fantastical in my starter game so that there&amp;rsquo;s something to grab the imagination. As always, I look forward to your thoughts on all of my conclusions. Next up I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a game that has grabbed me so strong I&amp;rsquo;m working on an expansion for it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Matter of Taste</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-02-05-a-matter-of-taste/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-02-05-a-matter-of-taste/ -&lt;p&gt;So, before we go into how to encourage a particular genre with the rules, there is the question of what genre to shoot for. If my whole contention is that the real draw of RPGs is the non-mechanical aspects, then a good starter RPG needs to have a genre with wide appeal and plenty of material to fire the imagination. I&amp;rsquo;ll run through a brief list of some popular settings/genres and my thoughts on them, but this is an area where personal taste could cloud my judgement extraordinarily easily, so I would very much appreciate comments on what flavors are good choices for players new to roleplaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroic Fantasy&lt;/strong&gt;: By &amp;lsquo;Heroic Fantasy&amp;rsquo;, I basically mean Dungeons and Dragons. I&amp;rsquo;ll include the grittier Sword and Sorcery flavor under this umbrella to keep things brief. In a heroic fantasy game, the players take on the roles of gifted individuals in a fantastic world (usually pseudo-medieval) and fight monsters and villains with magic, blades, and bows (again, usually. Star Wars has a lot of &amp;lsquo;heroic fantasy&amp;rsquo; elements, despite being in space). Settings frequently come from mythology, popular fantasy books (like Lord of the Rings), or historical/pseudo-historical sources (like &amp;lsquo;7th Sea&amp;rsquo;, which is roughly based on Age of Exploration Europe, but is a made up world with its own history). Benefits include that it is a familiar genre/setting to just about everyone, wide flexibility in the sorts of characters that are helpful, and just plain imagination firing fantastic elements. Negatives are that many folks have negative stereotypes associated with the genre (it&amp;rsquo;s nerdy, it&amp;rsquo;s for kids, it&amp;rsquo;s the work of Satan, et cetera), and that many of the things you can do (magic, sword fights, lots of monsters running around) lend themselves to more complex rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Opera&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, the Star Wars genre. As mentioned above, it has a lot in common with heroic fantasy, and considering both have ancestors in the late 19th and early 20th century pulp writers, this is unsurprising. Space Operas are characterized by, well, space, as well as a usually &amp;lsquo;fuzzy&amp;rsquo; approach to science and technology, a wealth of alien species and cultures, and a generally swashbuckling approach to problems. Benefits include wide knowledge and acceptance of (at least for Star Wars) which gives you players who already have a &amp;lsquo;buy in&amp;rsquo; to the setting, the excuse to come up with just about any situation you want for adventures (on this newly discovered planet. . .), and the fact that you get to use laser guns. Downsides could include many of those listed for heroic fantasy, as well as the potential to need to handle multiple scales of conflict - human scale as well as space ship scale, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Science Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;: Hard science fiction is a setting where the technology all either exists or else is based on extrapolations from current knowledge that are all consistent with modern knowledge of physics and science. A frequent &amp;lsquo;freebie&amp;rsquo; is to assume some newly discovered aspect of the physical world that allows faster than light travel, and then treat everything else more rigorously. The emphasis on gritty realism of technology usually spills over into other venues, with realistic politics and gritty challenges based on the hard realities of space being popular sources of drama. Babylon 5, Jovian Chronicles, and Starship Troopers (the book, not the movie) are all &amp;lsquo;hard&amp;rsquo; sci-fi to some degree or another. While the grittier drama and more serious tone of the game might appeal to some players, in reality this is even more of a niche genre than Space Opera or Heroic Fantasy. I love it so, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good choice as a default for a starter game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulp!&lt;/strong&gt;: As alluded to earlier, pulp writing covers a fairly large range of genres, from HP Lovecraft to H Rider Haggard to Edgar Rice Burroughs and beyond. Spirit of the Century does an excellent job of marking out a &amp;lsquo;default&amp;rsquo; pulp setting that focuses on early 20th century adventure with hints of the weird creeping in (rather like Indiana Jones) and an emphasis on the saving power of Science! I like to think of pulp as a genre &amp;lsquo;overlay&amp;rsquo;. Since a huge variety of pulp magazines published a multitude of genres from historical fiction to weird horror, you can easily pick some other more general genre, and &amp;lsquo;pulp it&amp;rsquo;. In pulping a genre, expect to up the action, up the melodrama, make the main characters a little larger than life, make the extras a little more two dimensional, and to keep the pace frenetic. Benefits of the default roaring 20s pulp setting or the wider pulp genre umbrella include emphasis on action, a purposefully simple approach to the world, and a flexibility in what sort of elements to incorporate. Downsides are that a lot of the original pulp sources are, well, written for adolescent boys in the 20s and 30s (or even before), and so tend to be sexist and occasionally racist. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean your game needs to bring those elements in, but your players may have existing baggage about the setting. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m leaning pretty strongly towards a pulp &amp;lsquo;flavor&amp;rsquo; to whatever genre I pick, and Spirit of the Century is already an excellent quick to pick up game with a delightful roaring 20s pulp setting in the vein of Doc Savage or Johnny Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horror/Supernatural&lt;/strong&gt;: For ease, I&amp;rsquo;m rolling together all the different flavors of horror and games about things that bump in the night. Vampire, Call of Cthulhu (pulp horror!), or whatever else, all of these games have a strong focus on either being scary, or at least on dark subject matter. As with the hard sci-fi, this darker subject matter may appeal to certain folks, especially those wishing their games to have a consciously more &amp;lsquo;mature&amp;rsquo; theme. While I love this genre, I have a few issues with it as a starter game. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to establish genuine horror in an RPG, and I imagine struggling to remember new rules and how this whole roleplaying thing works can&amp;rsquo;t contribute to a feeling of dread. Likewise, by its nature, horror tends to touch on disturbing and unpleasant subject matter, and one of the ways RPGs make those themes especially immediate is to thrust the players into dealing with them directly via their characters. I think a starter game should be way more concerned with making players comfortable than with pushing their boundaries. So, with a heavy sigh, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put aside the sanity points and save them for when my novice roleplayers are hungry for more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a potential exception: a game on or around Halloween, when everybody&amp;rsquo;s in a spooky-stuff mood anyway)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Westerns&lt;/strong&gt;: Here&amp;rsquo;s a genre with even wider appeal than the Space Opera or Heroic Fantasy settings. Not everybody loves westerns, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare to find someone who is entirely opposed to the idea. You have plenty of opportunity for action, violence, heists, and otherwise living outside the comfortable reach of the law or social norms. Unfortunately, being based on a fairly recent and well-known historical period gives you less room to play with things. Alternate history is a good way to get around this, and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lumpley.com/dogsources.html&#34;&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; does an amazing job of keeping a rock-solid western feel while allowing plenty of flexibility in making the game world suit your group. Some problems that could come out of a totally historical western are things like gender roles, race relations, and the interference of actual historical personages. I would give Samurai settings their own entry, but if Kurosawa and his influence on latter-day westerns didn&amp;rsquo;t convince you, most of the issues and benefits apply equally to Samurai settings as they do to westerns, except that in America, it&amp;rsquo;s a narrower interest than westerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action (the Ah-nahld genre)&lt;/strong&gt;: By &amp;lsquo;Action&amp;rsquo;, I here mean the genre of popcorn munching action movies. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the name of it, but I played a pick up game based on action movies where the more ridiculous and cinematic your described action, the &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; it was to succeed. Suffice to say, it was entertaining and people went over the top. This is a fun and easy to get into genre with loads of cultural context to fit it into. On the other hand, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t by nature focus very much on the roleplaying aspect of things, being defined instead by the aspects of the game most usually revolving around dice and mechanics. My personal take is that Action is a genre better mined for content to throw into other genres/settings than one to host a game all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other genres I have less experience with (Gaming-wise) and thus less to say, but thought I should throw out there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Heroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pirates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kung Fu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Spies&lt;/em&gt; (maybe a subgenre of Action!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humorous&lt;/em&gt; (see my entry &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicegods.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/dungeons-and-t%E2%80%A6om-outer-space/&#34;&gt;Dungeons and Teenagers from
Outerspace&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said at the get go, I&amp;rsquo;d love the hear your thoughts on various roleplaying genres and their utility for introducing new players.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setting vs Genre</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-02-05-setting-vs-genre/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2010 03:52:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2010-02-05-setting-vs-genre/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-02-05-setting-vs-genre/ -&lt;p&gt;Right now I want to talk about a distinction I recently came up with between setting and genre. Both get used pretty interchangeably with respect to RPGs, with setting usually having a slightly narrower focus. And either one is usually considered fairly separate from rules issues. But in a discussion of whether it was better to have specific rules for every game setting, or to have a great set of generic rules to use in whatever setting, I realized something about the interaction of the game rules and the game world that I think warrants a distinction in terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that game rules have more to do with what the people in the world can do, and what sorts of things are likely to happen. More focused on the action and tone than on the physical places, objects and people. Pretty arbitrarily, I decided &amp;lsquo;genre&amp;rsquo; fits this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate from genre, then, is setting. By setting here, I mean the actual physical characteristics. The scenery, the playable races, the technology level, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these two categories interact and overlap to a fair degree, but some examples might help to clarify what I mean, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll go into why I think rules affect genre more than setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have two games with similar settings. Both take place over many planets, have people and aliens with spaceships and guns, and include faster than light travel, lasers, and psychic powers. But in one of these settings, psychic powers come from tapping into a dangerous and largely hostile alternate dimension, humanity is xenophobic and backwards, technology is little understood and maintained by a semi-mystical priesthood, and there is only war. In the other, psychic powers represent the next step in evolution, humans interact with aliens in a number of ways, including trade, diplomacy, and war, technology is basically an extrapolation of what is currently understood, and one piece of it is the last, best hope for peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the physical elements of both settings have little to distinguish them, but what those worlds &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with these things makes all the difference in the world. While both have &amp;lsquo;space&amp;rsquo; as a setting, one has a genre of &amp;lsquo;gothic science fantasy&amp;rsquo; while the other might be called &amp;lsquo;hard science political drama&amp;rsquo; (or, you might call one &amp;lsquo;Warhammer 40,000&amp;rsquo; and the other &amp;lsquo;Babylon 5&amp;rsquo;, but you get the idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my suspicion that game rules have more influence on genre than they do on setting. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that if you made a space game with minimally modified D&amp;amp;D rules, it would still &amp;lsquo;feel&amp;rsquo; like heroic fantasy, even though your barbarian has chain axes and your space elf has a laser bow, or whatever. Or else you get Spelljammer. That would also explain why you have had for a long time a number of campaign settings for D&amp;amp;D with minimal rules tweaks, but those that change the genre significantly from heroic fantasy have had the most significant rules changes (like horror in Ravenloft or post-apocalyptic survival in Dark Sun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb for finding the difference between setting and genre is to take a game world (or movie world or whatever) and see if you can describe it as some cliche or familiar genre in X (where X describes a difference in physical location). Some example might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a western in Space&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like cyberpunk in the wild west, but with steam power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like a medieval x-files&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where all this gets me is that the goal of rules design is to come up with rules that reinforce the genre of a game rather than trying to capture aspects of the setting. If your setting has elves, that&amp;rsquo;s cool and all, but if they&amp;rsquo;re just tall, pretty people they don&amp;rsquo;t really need different rules. But if elven culture causes them to act in very different ways, or if subtle differences in their physiology makes them move differently, then rules can reinforce that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agon does an amazing job of defining its genre through rules, and even suggests multiple settings in addition to the default of ancient Greek mythology that would use the same genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is this a useful distinction? Or is it splitting hairs?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rules and Roleplaying</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-02-05-rules-and-roleplaying/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2010 03:51:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2010-02-05-rules-and-roleplaying/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-02-05-rules-and-roleplaying/ -&lt;p&gt;Well, last time I talked about how I want to focus more on roleplay than on game mechanics in my starter RPG. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: I&amp;rsquo;m a huge game mechanics nut. Sometimes I enjoy designing game rules more than I do actually playing them. As a kid, I once stayed up all night designing a wargame for little green army men that we never got to play because we were so excited about coming up with rules for each weapon, each vehicle, and every situation we could imagine. I mean, that is why I&amp;rsquo;m writing a game design blog right now, after all. So, for a starter RPG, whatever rules I do come up with, I want to be quality rules, but I want them to push the focus towards roleplaying rather than on to the interaction of different parts of the rules (such as which combination of options makes the best combat monster, or whatever). Later on, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a whole series of posts on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from reading the works of smarter and more experienced game designers than myself, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll layout some general thoughts on the interaction of rules and roleplaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post on Setting vs Genre, I talked about how rules interact more with the &amp;lsquo;genre&amp;rsquo; of a game than with the setting. Basically I defined genre as having more to do with how things in your game world act and what people do with them, whereas setting is the stuff that&amp;rsquo;s there. With this distinction, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that rules would have more to do with genre since rules cover actions. You don&amp;rsquo;t have rules for whether a tree is there or not (well, you might if you have an anally retentive terrain generation system for a focus on tactics, but even there your interest is in how it will interact with the people around it). But you do have rules for the more common actions, like fast-talking and shooting and investigating and such like. And I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet that your game has much more detailed investigation rules if it&amp;rsquo;s about discovering hidden truths and following mysteries than a game about fighting monsters and taking their treasure would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this gets us into an important interaction between rules and roleplaying: rules are for when the characters do stuff. And, more specifically, they&amp;rsquo;re for when they do stuff that someone else might take issue with. You usually don&amp;rsquo;t roll because a character walks across the street. But when he rushes across the street attempting to dodge machine gun fire, you probably would roll something! There&amp;rsquo;s a conflict of interest here. This is what makes the situation interesting enough to focus in on with rules. That conflict also makes it important to determine which party gets to have its say, and things are more fair when there are rules involved. Otherwise it might be roleplaying, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to genre. Genre helps you to determine what conflicts of interest are worth paying attention to, and how much attention to pay to them. Pretty much any game is going to pay at least some attention to people trying to do violence to one another (or to owlbears or mynocks, or whatever), but it says a lot about the genre desired if the game has detailed rules on quick-draw duels or back and forth sword fights or large scale battles. A particular game system might have some kind of rules for all of those violent conflicts of interest, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good bet that it focuses in on some more than others, and it&amp;rsquo;s a better bet that that focus is on those ares most relevant to the genre of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since actual play time is the only currency that really matters in a game (hat tip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arsludi.lamemage.com&#34;&gt;Ars Ludi&lt;/a&gt;), genre influencing rules will actually bend the roleplaying towards the genre the game is designed for. If you cover a pistol duel with one quick set of highly abstracted rolls that nobody is really optimized for, pistol dueling is a lot less likely to take a central place in the headspace of the players. If, on the other hand, you have detailed step by step rules that tie into multiple characteristics such that everybody has something relevant to pistol dueling and some folks are especially good at it, the game is going to take more time and focus on that situation, and players will devote more time and attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of this coin is pretty important, though. And that is where rules substitute for roleplaying. Imagine a game where you simply said &amp;ldquo;Okay, roll to see how well your conversation went&amp;rdquo; with zero actual talking. Again with thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arsludi.lamemage.com&#34;&gt;Ars Ludi&lt;/a&gt;, one common example is the spot check. Overuse of perception type skills takes players out of asking questions about their environment and becoming involved in it. And this brings me to another important element in &amp;lsquo;what rules are for in an RPG&amp;rsquo;: rules are for doing the things that the players can&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might cover the fact that there are no actual goblins to hit with a sword, or it might cover the fact that most folks who want to play a scholar of arcane secrets probably aren&amp;rsquo;t themselves scholars of arcane secrets. But when it comes to deciding what a player pays attention to, or coming up with plans, that very much is in the player&amp;rsquo;s control. When it comes to running a game, my rule of thumb when deciding whether something should be handled by the player or by the character&amp;rsquo;s abilities is to go with what results in more interesting play. Thus, if a fairly dumb and unimaginative character is played by a clever player who comes up with a zany plan for a heist that will make the game more fun for everyone, then the dumb character has a brilliant flash of insight. Or, if a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much about astrophysics, but it will make the game go along better for his character to come up with something in that field, then he can break out the dice. But for writing rules, especially those meant to encourage roleplaying more than mastery of a particular game system, I want to build in the right preferences, rather than relying on individual GMs to &amp;lsquo;make it work&amp;rsquo; (though I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will, as GMs making fun games out of whatever rules they use is a long and proud tradition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the way to go here is to create broad, flexible rules that deal more with generals than with specifics. Perhaps build in the option for players and GMs to delve deeper into specifics if they want, but if I have a choice between creating a game where you more frequently here &amp;ldquo;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s not really a rule for that, so just roll X + Y and we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;No, you can&amp;rsquo;t do that, because you didn&amp;rsquo;t take X trait, Y feat, and Z specialization&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;d much rather go for the former. Some of the game rules I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently have introduced me to some really exciting ways to get a lot done with few, streamlined rules, and in the next few posts I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of these ideas. But in the meantime, what do you think about how rules encourage or discourage roleplaying?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The RP in RPG</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-02-05-the-rp-in-rpg/</link>

        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-02-05-the-rp-in-rpg/ -&lt;p&gt;In my last post I talked about my own introduction to RPGs through D&amp;amp;D and it&amp;rsquo;s possible shortcomings as a game for new players, and then a game I found particularly suited to the task, Teenagers From Outer Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why set out to create a set of rules specifically for the purpose of introducing players to the hobby? Well, for one I have pragmatic reasons. I&amp;rsquo;m living and working in a place where I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other roleplayers, and so I don&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to indulge in my hobby of choice. But for another, I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a niche that could use filling. Most people who try out roleplaying are talked through their first few sessions by a more experienced friend in whatever game that friend happens to be playing or to particularly like. Or else a group of friends stumbles on one of the big ones (usually Dungeons and Dragons, which has recognized it&amp;rsquo;s place as practically the only RPG with name recognition outside of roleplaying circles and introduced starter kits in a box and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the reasons outlined in my prior post with respect to D&amp;amp;D (though they apply to other established systems as well), I feel like the focus is often wrong in these introductory attempts. The D&amp;amp;D in a box games provide little background flavor or opportunities to delve into characters. Joining an existing game in a full-featured system can have a steep learning curve.   So, where do I think the focus should be? For one, I think the focus should be more on the RP and less on the G. Most folks already have a pretty good idea what a game is, and from childhood have been trained to follow some fairly arbitrary rules in order to have fun. What RPGs offer that parcheesi or checkers don&amp;rsquo;t is the ability to combine the imagination and storytelling involved with reading a good book or getting into a movie with the structure and social elements of a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to come up with rules powerful enough to cover whatever situation a wily group of players may find themselves in (or at least, powerful enough to give the GM a fighting chance in winging it) but simple enough to be picked up quickly and to take a back seat to character decision making and interaction. I figure that anyone whose interests lean to character development and interaction will either keep up with my system or find other games with a similar philosophy and enjoy their interactive storytelling. Likewise, those players who find themselves hankering for more definition to their actions and tactical decision making can be led to those games that better fit their tastes. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s easier to go from roleplaying focused games to &amp;lsquo;crunchy&amp;rsquo; games than it is to go the other way, and that there are more folks more likely to be turned off by too much mechanical detail than likely to be turned off of the whole hobby from too little of that and too much story focus.   But I could be wrong, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear feedback on why I could be totally mistaken here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dungeons and Teenagers from Outer Space</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-02-05-dungeons-and-teenagers-from-outer-space/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2010 03:36:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2010-02-05-dungeons-and-teenagers-from-outer-space/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-02-05-dungeons-and-teenagers-from-outer-space/ -&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas on what elements a good &amp;lsquo;starter&amp;rsquo; RPG needs, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through a number of games in order to find more ideas to add to that list. But I&amp;rsquo;ll start with some of my actual play experience with starting new players on RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with the start, my own (and I suspect many others&amp;rsquo;) first RPG was the venerable Dungeons and Dragons. I myself started out with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Second Edition. I had many a great game of AD&amp;amp;D and it will always hold a special place in my heart, but I have begun to expect that it hooked me into RPGs more because of who I am than because of the rules themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read through the Players Handbook, I was just a kid (nine years old). I found the rules bewilderingly complex. Once I actually sat down and played, that helped a lot, and when I reread the rules two or three years later, they seemed amazingly simple. For one thing, I&amp;rsquo;m sure my own increased maturity and mental faculties helped, and for another I&amp;rsquo;m sure that having play experience to map the abstract rules onto helped a lot, but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started wondering if my initial reaction was solely due to my youth, or if perhaps older people with no prior knowledge might find them similarly bewildering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dungeons and Dragons rules, of all editions, show their tactical wargaming roots, with a strong focus on multiple exciting things to do in combat and detailed rules to cover them. Fourth edition has gone a long way towards making these rules easy to grasp, provide balanced play, and to be pretty darn neat, honestly. But as much as I love detailed games and rules systems, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s any of these features that made me grow to love the hobby. THAC0 never fired my imagination, hit dice didn&amp;rsquo;t keep me coming to the table, and encumbrance rules certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t make me think I wanted to branch out and try other roleplaying games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always the roleplaying itself that gave the rules their spice, the imaginary people and creatures in their imaginary worlds that kept me coming to the table and rolling those neat polyhedral dice. The rules were a means to an end, albeit an interesting means. They were a tool for fleshing out personas and interacting with their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t very long before I was introduced to one of my favorite RPGs of all time, which produced some of my fondest in-game memories and stories, and yet was one of the least serious approaches to roleplaying I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Teenagers From Outer Space (R. Talsorian Games, 3rd Edition, when they got all the zany Anime stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teenagers From Outer Space (TFOS) is a light hearted comedy roleplaying game about, well, teenagers, many of whom are from outer space. It helped that I was introduced to it by a talented and entertaining game master who made improvisation seem effortless and who seems to have been made to run wacky, alien-filled John Hughes style stories. He also frequently used TFOS as a &amp;lsquo;gateway drug&amp;rsquo; into the wonderful world of roleplaying games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starter RPG Project</title>
        <link>/gaming/2010-01-31-starter-rpg-project/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2010 01:57:00 -0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>/gaming/2010-01-31-starter-rpg-project/</guid>
        <description>Jeff Russell&#39;s Webstead /gaming/2010-01-31-starter-rpg-project/ -&lt;p&gt;Well, the first project I&amp;rsquo;m going to share progress on is my attempt to create a roleplaying game custom built to introduce new players, with a strong emphasis on quick character creation, one-off or pick up game playability, and ease of learning the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to layout some of my general philosophy behind what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, and in later posts I&amp;rsquo;ll get into more specifics and make references to games that have influenced me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my reasoning behind a &amp;lsquo;starter&amp;rsquo; focused RPG is pragmatic. I&amp;rsquo;m at a point in my life where I don&amp;rsquo;t have easy access to my gaming friends, but I still have a strong desire to run and play RPGs. So I want to create a gateway drug to get interested friends hooked on a hobby that has entertained me for over a decade already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am intrigued in the process of refining down to the essentials of an RPG. The quintessence of roleplaying games, if you will. I imagine there&amp;rsquo;s something of a judgement call to be made here, but in reviewing minimalist and alternative roleplaying games, it&amp;rsquo;s become more clear what makes even more traditional games tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, my goal is to create a game that will be fun, easy to learn and run, and that emphasizes roleplaying and collective storytelling over tactical planning and fighting (not that fights won&amp;rsquo;t be involved, of course, they&amp;rsquo;re just going to be seen more through the lens of why they&amp;rsquo;re dramatic rather than how to most effectively tackle them). I&amp;rsquo;ve got lots more on where I&amp;rsquo;m coming from, with examples, but those deserve more detailed posts.&lt;/p&gt;
