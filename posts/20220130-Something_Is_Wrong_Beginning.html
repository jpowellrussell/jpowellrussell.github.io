        <p>Most of the time, I'd rather write about what I'd like to see more of in the world, rather than what's wrong with it, but I worry that much of what I'd like to share won't mean much without setting up a few things. In short: something deep and widespread is wrong with the world. It's hard to spot if you go looking for it straight-on, but you catch glimpses of it here and there from the corners of your eyes.</p>

        <p>It is the thrown-out plastic water bottle in an otherwise spotless stream. It is the streaming comedy that rings brittle and hollow. It is the buzzing of a notification for a social media app. It is the sneering look of cynical contempt that curdles a young face.</p>

        <p>Call it ennui. Call it anomie. Call it nihilism. Call it by whichever French philosophical word you like. It is an <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">Immoral Maze</a>. It is <a href="https://samzdat.com/the-uruk-series/">Uruk</a>. It is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Moloch</a>.</p>

        <p>It is all around us, and most of the ways put forward to deal with it are wholly lacking.</p>

        <p>So what might we do about this, whatever it is? I hope that pinning it down a bit might give us a few ideas of what is to be done, and then we can go onto the more welcome work of fleshing those out.</p>
