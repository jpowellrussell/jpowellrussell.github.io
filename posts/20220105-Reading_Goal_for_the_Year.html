        <p>This year, I've set myself a reading goal inspired by <a href="http://ecosophia.net">John Michael Greer</a> who describes his reading habits as "mostly reading books by dead people". Since I've been reading a lot of his books recently and that approach jives with some of my other thoughts on reading, I decided to set myself the challenge for 2022 of literally following that advice, so here's the rule I've set for myself:</p>
        <p><i>For all of 2022, I will read only books written by people who have died, with the following exceptions: 1. I need to read it for work, 2. I am using it to learn a craft I actually put into practice during 2022, or 3. it is by a close friend or family member.</i></p>
        <p>I have already bent the rules <i>slightly</i>, as I finished reading a novel by the afore-mentioned JMG on the 2nd that I started after Christmas. From here on out, though, I plan to follow the above rule very strictly. So why am I doing this?</p>
        <p>A few reasons. First, I have been looking for more ways to follow the Murakami's advice to <a href="">not read what other people are reading</a>, and older books are a good way to do that. "The author is dead" makes for a decent, if somewhat dramatic, proxy for "this book is older". Secondly, it also works as a decent proxy for the <a href="">"Lindy Effect"</a> - the notion that the longer a work has been readily available, the more likely it is to be something worthwhile. Thirdly, I hope that it will help me rein in my natural tendency to go haring off after whatever is new and shiny, and instead finally get around to reading some stuff that's been on my list for a while, especially some classic works.</p>
        <p>So, there we are. Right now, I'm about a third of the way through <i>God is Red</i> by Vine Deloria, Jr., and I think next up I'll go for the provocatively titled <i>Decline of the West</i> by Oswald Spengler. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!</p>
